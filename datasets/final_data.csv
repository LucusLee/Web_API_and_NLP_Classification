0,is there any point learning french i have been learning french on and off for twenty year now however i am barely intermediate recently i have been thinking about investing more time in it and trying to get better three year ago i went to tour to study the language for a month just for fun when i wa emailing the school to work out the detail they mentioned dinner would be provided by a host family and i explained i would happily pay full price but manage my own food a i'm vegan they said this wa not compatible with their culture and insisted that i shouldn't come i did go and the family accepted me to an extent whilst also showing off picture of all the wild boar and deer they have hunted and teasing me during dinner anyway after spending so many hour of my life learning this god forsaken tongue i would really like to get to a point where i actually feel like i can have a conversation with someone and that it hasn't all been for nought on the other hand am i ever going to be able to happily live in france i would love to live in a foreign country but it really seems like they are too far behind the time for it to be a viable option for a vegan person i love the process of learning language i studied french and latin at school but neither have ever had any practical value to me should i just quit and start over with a language from a more vegan country german perhaps

0,stage of veganism ha anyone ever described anything like 'stages of veganism' that are typical for people to go through i'm somewhat new and still learning but recently the gravity of everything ha really been hitting home for me and fucking with me in way that i wasn't particularly expecting i've known that i probably shouldn't consume animal product for a while and sort of just accepted that without needing to really expose myself to the reality of everything so i never really sat down to watch like slaughterhouse footage or anything because i didn't feel like i needed that and that i already understood bad thing happen but just being more aware of everything ha turned me in a way that i wasn't expecting first there were these sort of notion of needing to reduce followed by flirtation with veganism with some apologetic argument to committing oneself to it to just the 'shit get real' gravity of the situation that hit and your perception of thing start changing and you know you're not going back maybe there are stage after this that are common i think i need to join a vegan group in real life and that just doing it on my own isn't really enough

0,i am so tired of people admitting that veganism is a positive thing then refusing to do it i am normally a very chill vegan and don't want to be the angry vegan but i cannot take another conversation with someone who in the end say something like we will all probably have to be vegan soon and then just moving on without making a change i have yet to hear an argument with any sort of sense to continue being omni they all are so weak and it always come down to yeah good for you but i'm not doing that it is pretty difficult to write all these frustration down without making it longer than the lord of the ring but i'm sure everyone subbed here know what i'm talking about slightly unrelated but i saw a post about how dating a vegan is exhausting and the bf wa upset that his vegan gf wasn't making any compromise for him and he wa the only one making sacrifice despite her being fine with him eating flesh what are you even taking about dude if she doesn't eat something you eat if she had a peanut allergy you wouldn't be pooping your pant over her not eating peanut 
0,if people really cared about their kid or their grandkids they would stop eating animal product and supporting those industry that profit off of the suffering and enslavement of animal there i said it i apologize but i'm going to rant for a minute i had someone tell me recently if you were a real environmentalist you wouldn't invest in crypto i mean yes crypto definitely ha an environmental impact but so doe posting on reddit using facebook streaming video and or music on netflix spotify if our society ran on renewables this wouldn't even be an argument i hope that one day our society will diverge fully from fossil fuel onto renewables and i am trying to make that happen a best i can but i'm only one person with limited capital and influence doing what i believe is possible to make a difference but getting back to the main reason for this post that statement it felt like it negated all of the change that my wife and i have made in the last four year trying to be more environmentally conscious and pro animal safety and health we use a little plastic a we can we recycle a much a we can we share a vehicle and only use it when absolutely necessary we rarely travel we compost we eat a vegan diet and avoid animal product a much a we can when it come to other product i refuse to quit because of thing like that i believe in the beauty of this planet and the right to life of all the being on it i will do what i can to help protect it i don't even have kid nor do i want them but i do want them to be able to look forward to the future like i did when i wa younger i feel sorry for the generation after me i feel like they are definitely getting the short stick in term of crumb to live off of after my generation and those before me are gone everyone seems to have this all or nothing mentality when it come to making real change when in fact this is often not feasible at all when it come to being a vegan we went all in on that right off the hop but i find most people like to break into it slowly maybe cut out meat gradually then dairy then egg small change lead to big thing when done on a large scale i saw a statement somewhere once that really resonated with me it wa something to the effect of we don't need a few people making major change to get thing on track we need the majority of people making a few change end rant thank you for reading keep up the great work all you lovely people and stay safe together we will make a real difference

0,the essay that convinced me to become a vegan the very fact that one is alive mean consuming nutrient and staying alive mean that something somewhere must die in order to supply these nutrient this is a fact of life and the marvellous thing about a fact is that one can not argue with it one can argue about a belief an opinion a theory an ideal and so on but a fact never one can deny a fact pretend that it is not there but once seen a fact brings freedom from choice and decision most people think and feel that choice implies freedom having the freedom to choose but this is not the case freedom lie in seeing the obvious and in seeing the obvious there is no choice no deliberation no agonising over the right and wrong judgment in the freedom of seeing the fact there is only action when it come to the consumption of nutrient there are many and various belief one can hold dearly to there are people who will not eat red meat at all only white meat and fish then there are people who will not eat any flesh of warm blooded animal at all only fish and reptile then there are people vegetarian who will not eat any meat at all but will consume egg and dairy product then there are people vegan who will eat only vegetable grain and seed then there are people fruitarians who will only eat fruit then a we go into myth and fantasy there are those who live on water and air and finally those who live on air only some vegetarian maintain that a a carrot for example doe not scream audibly when it is pulled from the ground there is no distress caused by the consumption of vegetable yet the carrot indubitably dy slowly by being extracted from it life support system the ground is it home and is this not distressing on some level of a living growing organism it all depends upon the level or degree of aliveness that one ascribes to thing vegan for instance will not consume egg a this prevents an incipient life from being born fruitarians go one step further and say that a the consumption of carrot prevents them from going to seed and sprouting new life vegetable are to be eschewed entirely then a the eating of grain and seed also prevent potential life form from growing they will eat only the flesh of the fruit that surround the kernel and plant out the embryo plant form i have been a fruitarian so i know full well what i am speaking of the obvious fact is clearly demonstrated by taking all this to it ultimate consideration what will one do a a fruitarian causing no pain or the taking of life of anyone or anything about those pesky thing like mosquito sand fly cockroach rat mouse and other vermin that invade my house put up screen what about outside will i slap them dead or just shoo them away what will one do if attacked by a snake a crocodile a shark a lion and so on do a the revered scripture say and turn the other cheek will i humbly submit to my fate and be mauled severely myself or even killed simply because of a religious injunction a moral scruple a noble ideal a virtuous belief a passionate opinion a deeply held ethical theory in other word have animal and insect been given the right by some inscrutable god to do with me whatsoever they wish is my survival dependent upon the non existent benevolence of all those sentient being that i am not going to cause distress to what then about germ bacteria bacillus microbe pathogen phage virus and so on are they not entitled to remain alive and pain free if one take medication for disease one is possibly painfully killing off the microscopic creature that one s body is the host too some religion the jain religion in india for example ha it devout member wearing gauze over their nose and mouth to prevent insect from flying in and they even carry small broom to sweep the path a they walk so that they will not accidentally step on some creature it can really get out of hand for instance small pox ha been eradicated from the world by scientist a a mean of saving countless human life is this somehow wrong what is right in regard to what i do in order to stay alive if i do none of these thing then i will be causing pain and suffering to myself and i am a sentient being too it is an impossible scenario when pursued to it ultimate conclusion and then there is the matter of one s fellow human being some of them in fact at time a lot of them are desirous of invading the country that one is living peacefully in with the avowed intent of killing torturing raping pillaging and subjugating oneself and one s fellow citizen if one hold a strong and passionate belief in not causing any pain and suffering to other sentient being then one must be more than a fruitarian one must be a pacifist a well this amount to hanging out a sign if everybody else in the country one life in adopts this specific belief which say in effect please feel free to invade u we will not fight back for we hold firmly to the principle of not causing pain and suffering to any sentient being whatsoever the tibetan situation is a particular case in point thus anarchy would rule the world all because of a belief system handed down by the saint and the sage the messiah and the avatar the redeemer and the saviour the prophet and the priest century after century

0,i hate the common omni argument on reddit of i don't need to change my habit because corporation are the real polluter do these people think corporation just pump out greenhouse gas for shit and gig corporation are only polluting to fill the market for the consumption of every day customer i hate this mentality of i'm just one person i can't change anything billion of human think this way and then nothing end up changing i'm just sick of the excuse 
0,how to start a movement ok i need your help here i have been seeing a lot of post from people concerned about the environment but stating that their is nothing we can do a individual to help our planet and that it is up to the large corporation to change which will never happen how can we get the word out that everyone can have an immediate and exponential impact on climate change by simply eliminating meat seafood animal product from their diet and lifestyle if we get enough people to make this change we could actually save our planet but how can we convince a large amount of people of this any idea 
0,accidentally converted myself to veganism for life i've been eating vegan for two month and now i realized this is what i want for the rest of my life and i consider myself vegan now the story is somewhat funny i'm 17 come from a family living in a rural nowhere family's quite conservative and all and basically my mother started having trouble with her arm which hurt a lot two month ago she can't do all the thing she did before so my parent dumped it all on me i'm the only girl and i have two brother before that it wa my mother doing most of the chore and all with me helping now it's me who have to do it all my parents' word but even if we ask them they won't do it they'll do it wrong ok mind you my dad won't do shit either of course amp x200b so i decided to make it suck a i said it's quite a conservative family and for some reason my little brother had something specifically against vegan literally would make up obviously fake story about annoying vegan girl at school that he dissed he is 15 also i'm literally in the same school my whole family is the kind that'd say bacon lol if someone say they are vegan i'm the one doing all the cooking now so we went vegan they hate it by principle they hate it especially when i make something good and they ask what's in it and realize it's vegan now they aren't fooled anymore and just say everything taste disgusting by default mind you none of them have taken up cooking lmao they have taken up snacking madly on junk food though looking for vegan recipe made me read more and more into veganism and definitely convinced me slowly but surely and i discovered lot of vegan alternative to food i used to love though there isn't much vegan meat and whatever where i live lmao i will be leaving to move to another city for university in about a month and i don't see myself going back to my previous diet 
0,ban restrict vegan brand on packaging and recipe my point is simple and follows the thinking of derek from wicked kitchen the purpose of buying and cooking on a vegan diet is mainly animal condition and environmental protection at least on my case but whatever it is we have to have more people trying and enjoying plant recipe so when a person go out to shop and see the corridor with big vegan banner ill think oh this is the hippie section or even i don't like this food just use plant based healthy food im sure marketing people can do better 
0,my friend just mocked veganism and it just ha me really hurt tbh i don't know i just need to vent to people who actually kind of get it because i'm in a really bad headspace with it right now the whole thing really fucked me up i have friend in a discord server one of them i've known for about a year the others are newer friend the friend i know ha always been very serious about immediately stopping any sort of mockery or bashing towards another person and they've always been open minded which is a quality in them i've always admired well today they bring up a certain controversial vegan activist in the chat which is fine i wa a bit nervous because i wa scared the conversation would go wrong but these people are aware that i am vegan and there are other vegan in the server a well i figured that they could have their conversation respectfully and chose not to participate well it got out of hand all of a sudden there's these lol i bet activist is one of those vegan who xx and lol vegan like that make me want to eat a ton of meat and just thing that were extremely offensive to me especially because these people were having a completely different conversation with me in another channel while saying all of this anyway i finally said something because it wa genuinely giving me anxiety and they just seemed like more interested in telling me that i'm wrong than actually listening to me when i say that xx or xx is wrong and is extremely offensive to say they essentially asked me why it wa offensive and i told them and they told me i wa wrong and then when i said otherwise they just shut the whole thing down i don't know i just feel judged secretly and also it feel very backhanded that all other mockery towards any group or anything is banned but this wa okay like maybe that's how they really feel about me and maybe i'm not really wanted in that space either way which frankly i don't want to be in space that treat me like that i don't know it just feel really shitty because i feel backstabbed maybe i expected something in the friendship in regard to a level of respect for my ethic and belief because if i said something really offensive about a friend of mine's belief i'd want to know so that i can apologize and make sure they knew that i understood how offensive that could be and that i'd do what i could to ensure that sort of conversation wouldn't happen again maybe i'm just selfish for expecting someone to alter their conversation around me it hard to say i just feel really shitty and now my anxiety is a fucking mess anyways thanks for coming to my rant i'm sure i'll delete this later 
0,18 concluding 6 month of veganism i decided to go vegan on the 15th of october 2020 and so far it s going great well way better than i expected at least i wa surprised to find out that some vegan alternative taste much better than their animal based equivalent like shit the variety of plant based milk is pretty much endless and i have never looked back ever since however i had some trouble during the first 2 week for a couple of day i had no idea what to eat and i just felt like a zombie walking around i wa pretty much sick but it never happened to me ever since my blood test result came way better than they did 2 year ago with no shit like high cholesterol sugar and what not and i have lost the majority of my beer gut so that s pretty cool

0,opinion on peta ad lately whenever i'm on youtube i get a ton of ad made by peta the kind of ad that have a lot of shock value like seeing animal being slaughtered and being unable to skip the ad at least for 5 second i'm vegan in what i wear and eat and one of the reason i've become vegan is because of the ethical issue with the animal industry i'm also extremely sensitive to seeing animal being hurt and i avoid documentary that focus on showing that to spread a message but being forced to watch the ad on youtube is really not enjoyable considering i'm already vegan and am planning to stay that way for a long time it's like i'm being traumatized even though i'm already traumatized anyways i wanted to know what you guy thought about peta ad have you been seeing more of them lately do you feel like they have an effect do you think the shock value is justified what is your reaction when you see them

0,i m in despair i m currently watching dominion i fell off the vegan bandwagon maybe a year and a half ago for no real reason i wa having a hard time but it s not really an excuse i have always been vegetarian but we all know it s not really any better i ve been vegan again for maybe three month and although i don t feel like i m at risk of stopping again i feel like it s important to see the truth of the matter to drill in my resolve and i guess partly self flagellation for my selfishness i suppose this seems like an unnecessary rant we ve probably all felt this way but i cannot understand how this is happening how can we do this i care about the environmental aspect of all of this a well but even if none of that wa a factor this pain and torture is abominable if anyone ha any belief that we should do good in the world and not cause harm then you cannot support this industry the disrespect we re showing these creature is like something out of saw it should not exist i m continually gagging and i m only ten minute in i know all we can do is stop eating it ourselves and using product but that doesn t feel like enough i ve always suffered from severe depression but knowing what is happening in this very moment and ha happened for year and will seemingly continue is making me sick and hopeless my family and friend don t want to see nobody want to see this anyone with any power and sway in this world doesn t seem to want to help either of course there are exception but overall we re just fucked i ll be okay i m sure this just feel like the only place anyone will understand i feel hate toward the worker so cruel and callous about it all they can t even treat the animal with dignity they actively make their life even more of a hell these beautiful being only want food and freedom and would a individual show u all the love our pet do a i write this my cat is climbing in my lap to check on me because he care about me i know if any piglet of calf were rescued they could bond just a much with me i just wish i could thanos style snap them out of existence maybe that s cruel too but it seems better than what they have ideally i wish they could live free life but what would that mean to a genetically altered beast that no longer ha any part in the natural ecosystem we alter the world with no regard for what could happen and we deserve whatever we get because of it it s breaking my heart that we re taking everything else with u this rock will keep spinning when we re gone and new life will rise but how awful that everything beautiful here may be lost before we make our exit i love this planet it s gorgeous with unbelievable condition that allowed u all to thrive i love the plant the land itself and of course the animal i m having a hard time loving my fellow human if you take the time to read this i appreciate you this really ha no meaning it s just a rant

0,the health argument are often the weakest it's not that you can't be incredibly healthy a a vegan it's not that being vegan doesn't have health benefit either but often time the health argument vegan use are false or over exaggerated human are omnivore after all we have shown throughout history that we can eat many different way and survive the vegan diet is the most ethical it isn't to say that you can be healthy consuming animal product that's not the point and if that were the case many group of people who consume predominantly animal wouldn't have survived 
0,word of encouragement hope this kind of post is allowed first time posting here i m several month into the veggie lifestyle i m personally loving it i love the food i make i feel great physically and emotionally i m healthier than ever i no longer feel guilty for contributing to the mistreatment of animal or damage done to the environment but i m feeling defeated af i just want to share all the stuff i ve learned over my albeit recent journey with others because i m excited about it i ve read so many science based book and study a well a watched a lot of documentary about the harm of eating animal and animal byproduct unfortunately people are so biased to eating meat and just blatantly misinformed about the evidence behind the harm of it all i find myself trying to be a objective and science based a possible but i wind up getting into debate i didn t want to get in i don t want to be that person who come across a the condescending vegan forcing their belief down someone else s throat because apparently that s just automatically how you re perceived a soon a someone learns you don t eat meat and care about the planet insert eye roll here i just want to be an advocate without being too much i just want to help other people i wish i had known about all the health benefit to eating plant based much sooner i wish i had known the full extent about how even just drinking milk and supporting the dairy industry result in cow suffering i wa just blissfully ignorant i guess but i really wish i had made the switch year ago anyways any advice on how to not feel so sad and defeated about people just not caring about going plant based besides apparently never saying anything on reddit regardless of how non argumentative i try to be lol i d normally not care and let people make their own decision and personal choice but i just feel sorry for the animal that are innocent victim 
0,reducing eliminating cheese from my diet i've been a long term vegetarian mostly started because i didn't like the idea of complicated emotional creature like pig and cow being factory farmed with little concern for their well being this stance ha expanded over the year to include the obvious environmental argument for a reduced land use impact on the world and reduction of the high greenhouse gas emission that result from raising the billion of animal we slaughter every year i haven't however yet went so far a to cut out animal product such a egg and dairy especially a i can buy some of them from a farm near my house that ha a lovely sense of animal welfare but after speaking with my roommate more about reducing our individual impact i decided to look closely at what the emission are of the food that i commonly eat and wow it turn out cheese chocolate and coffee account for the bulk of what's left of my food related greenhouse emission the rough ball park is that my consumption of just those three product lead to about 500kg of co2 equivalent being emitted per year equal to roughly what i emit from power consumption or traveling by bus subway rail the rest of my food consumption combined probably only equal 200 300kg of co2 with a lot of that being from olive oil using the data found here http ourworldindata org food choice v eating local it's a tough sell for me a i like practically every cheese and would put it on every meal in some way chocolate isn't a huge deal for me and i've replaced coffee with some other coffee like product made from wheat that don't have caffeine but do the trick for me probably i will take an approach to reduce my consumption allowing the odd cheesy treat instead of having it be a very regular part of my purchase diet anyway i kinda just wanted to think this through and type it out happy to hear some friendly criticism other non partisan source of info discussion that isn't just expressing moral to each other etc

0,the usda are the biggest bunch of liar on this earth on the usda s official website it state that you should be drinking 2 and a half cup of dairy milk every single day even though it ha been shown time and time again that there are serious health risk associated with drinking milk of a different specie not only this but they have an area where you can input your age weight and gender and they will tell you how much you need of each food group fruit vegetable whole grain protein source and dairy i tried inputting my own information and it said i needed 2 and a half cup of milk i then tried to put in the info for a 95 year old man who weighs 999 pound and it said i needed to be on a diet 1200 calorie le than when i put in my actual information to achieve a healthy weight in those 1200 calorie lost they were all le fruit vegetable whole grain and protein source and the same amount of milk no matter what data you put in with the excepted of kid under 9 year old you will find they recommend the same amount of milk whether you re young or old obese or skinny male or female it doesn t matter yet what doe change is the amount of fruit and vegetable you should eat the more you weigh which on the website they say is le so obviously being paid off by the dairy industry and they don t even try to hide it never trust the usda with any of their recommendation because more than likely they re getting paid to tell you something that is simply not true

0,why are most vegan liberal left leaning genuinely curious i ve been vegan for year i feel very strongly about it and i consider myself a centrist i m not saying veganism is politically related but i ve just noticed that most vegan are liberal i ve also seen lot of conservative completely trash on vegan i believe that veganism doesn t have a political affiliation just a like how being against slavery doesn t have a political affiliation i m really big on free thought valuing fact over emotion which conservative constantly promote and i view this a being 100 in line with being vegan ignoring animal slaughter and torture is the opposite of fact over feeling if you feel so strongly about your love of meat and are willing to ignore all the fact that meat meat product do to the world and to animal then that is the definition of being too sensitive on the other hand i do think that liberalism ideology today is not very rooted in fact at all the social change that liberal tend to promote going on now feminism racial movement etc in my opinion ha taken a dark turn don t make a whole lot of sense when you look at the fact i obviously support equality for all race gender sexual orientation everything but the ideological underpinning of what the movement have become today is something i don t necessarily agree with and i just think they are so dissimilar from being vegan but are branded the same way and if you don t care then just say you don t care but don t brand vegan a being touchy feely when it tangible harmful effect are supported by so much evidence i suppose that most of the correlation of how vegan are usually left leaning is because liberal are known for being big on social change and conservative are more adamant on traditional value it s just interesting to me what do you guy think 
0,i don't think this get said enough i love being vegan non vegan often talk about veganism like it's this big sacrifice and i know that's how it seems when you're looking at it through the lens of carnism but after being vegan for three year i can honestly say that i love being vegan i love the food i'm moving to seattle soon and the few time i've visited there i wa blown away by the all vegan restaurant in 21 year living on earth i'm not exaggerating when i say the best food i've ever eaten in my life wa from an all vegan restaurant in seattle if you live in seattle you might know the place i'm talking about it's in greenlake but it's not just restaurant vanilla oat yeah is like my favorite drink it's so delicious and i'm not surprised big dairy is scared of veganism because cow's milk wa never a good a oat milk i love the people vegan are some of the coolest people i know vegan are brave you have to be brave to stand up to a cultural institution that's a huge and oppressive a carnism to stand up to friend and family who constantly ridicule and question u vegan are kind it shouldn't take a lot of empathy to realize that animals' life are more important than humans' taste bud but it doe and you can see it in the way vegan talk to and support each other and interact with animal and the world around them finally i love the animal when you think about it not harming animal is such a simple and obvious thing which is why we say it's the moral baseline it is the moral baseline but i still love it i love knowing that when i say i care about animal it's not hollow and ironic i love petting my cat and knowing that farmed animal have just a much individuality and personality a she doe and that i'm no longer supporting their torture and murder so to all non vegan just remember it take nothing away from a human to be kind to an animal and to all vegan i love you homie

0,to newbie vegan from a newbie vegan this post is also for people considering veganism but are scared to take the leap i became vegan just 2 month ago but i think this might help someone i used to be a massive meat eater just 2 month ago seriuously i couldn't rember going more than 1 day without some type of meat before going vegan im serious i used to proud myself in saying if it doesn't contain meat it not a real meal obviusly that wa a joke but there wa truth to it for sure the first week going vegan i felt absolutely miserable i thought i would never enjoy food again all of my favourite recepies not only included meat and dairy but basically revolved around them i wa actually super depressed i even made a post here lol i remeber trying a beyond burger and literally thinking yep this doesn't taste anything like meat i guess i am cursed to never enjoy food in my life also cooking vegan bolognese fot the first time and remeber trying it out and just throwing the whole pot away because it wa gross then for some reason i swear to zeus after trying my second beyond burger since the only way to get it wa to buy the 10 pack i wa like what the hell this isn't bad at all third time trying it i wa hooked it really bizzare that it changed so quickly but i remeber the first time the smell while it wa raw cat food let be honest and grilling wa foul to me i still is but when grilled it godlike like serously i make sure not to eat more than 1 or 2 every 2 week since it isn't the healthiest food but i would crush them and inject them in my bloodstream if i could now well made beyond burger with sexy lettuce juciy tomato fried onion spicy jalapeños bbq and chipotle sauce and baked potato oh lordy im a simple man and thats a food orgasm to me also i tried to make a few adjustements to my vegan bolognese and it turned out extrenely delicious literally the polar opposite of my first try what i wanted to say with this is don't get discouraged at the beggineng some thing are different when it come to recepies and it will take you some time to adjust but i have to say for me it changed super quickly way quicker than i would have thought i haven't craved meat at all and i have never been a big cheese person anyway i did buy vegan cheese for my bolognese and it wa dope too so if anyone is currently starting out just because you currently feel like shit doesn't not mean it your new normal it not just experiment and check out youtube channel or article trust me you are gonna find delicious food and learn to make it and this come from a former meatholic 
0,lab grown meat a an ethical solution to industrial animal farming i haven't seen much conversation about this it's very unlikely that we will be able to halt animal farming on the ethical argument for reducing the suffering of sentient being alone people want to eat meat regardless of the horror necessary to produce it under current condition aside from animal harm we know that animal farming ha led to zoonotic disease that are responsible for virtually every pandemic in history but that hasn't stopped u either if the biggest reason people don't care about the harm that animal farming ha on people and other animal is that they just like the taste then an actual cell based meat would be the best alternative right the problem is this industry would have to compete with not only the meat industry but also with plant based industry i've seen the cost of lab meat go down drastically in 10 year and really hope to see this alternative in the future because it's probably our best shot at a healthier and more ethical future for people and other animal alike http www theguardian com environment 2020 dec 02 no kill lab grown meat to go on sale for first time

0,how do you defend seaspiracy i work with a vegan and she wa super outspoken against cowspiracy when it came out even though it wa one of the factor that made me go vegan for good i don t really see what disinformation she gathered from that seaspiracy though i m having a tougher time defending a a white woman i am terrified of promoting a white savior complex or vilifying culture that are just trying to survive in this money driven world we live in i am sensitive to these issue but at the end of the day i think animal should just be left alone over everything else i feel like these criticism of seaspiracy are valid but also miss the point that there are a lot of way humanity is killing the ocean and we should limit our impact wherever we can 
0,important post on vegan dog food not all dog food is good some is really bad i'm feeding my dog vdog nugget after doing research it's extremely unhealthy for them to it being very inflammatory the oil in it is sunflower seed oil which is extremely high in omega 6 which can be a huge problem for dog on a vegan diet it cause a lot of inflammation and it severely limit their conversion of ala to dha and epa omega 3 and this is why after switching my dog to vdog nugget they have become really itchy and keep biting their body since vegan dog are not recieving dha and epa which either come from fish or algae and they're recieving ala instead then they would have enough omega 3 to combat the inflammation from high omega 6 intake which make high omega 6 intake a much bigger problem for vegan dog than non vegan dog you can give dog algae oil but it's not necessary it's better to switch them to a good vegan dog food that doesn't use a high omega 6 oil then they won't have high omega 6 level and they would also be able to convert ala to dha and epa sadly i have a 15kg unopened bag of vdog nugget that they have to go through so i may order them algae oil while they go through it so that it help with their skin problem from the high omega 6 content in their dog food make sure your vegan dog food is good not all are and vdog nugget certainly isn't good 
0,euthanisms i've been reading article and interview from animal farmer and their apologist and i've noticed that whenever talking about an animal that's being killed for some reason other than meat declining egg milk wool production male calf chick they'll use the phrase euthanasia not even to be a preachy vegan about it this is just straight up incorrect usage of the word people opt for euthanasia when they have painful terminal illness i get my cat euthanised when she's old and suffering it's not possible to euthanise a healthy young bull chick or even an older layer hen who is at least a healthy a she wa when she wa pushing out an egg a day because by definition euthanasia is killing to end suffering but of course saying killed for not being profitable or murdered is much le clinical and merciful sounding than euthanised and so i propose a new term for when omnis are too bitch to use the real word for their atrocity euthanism

0,advice needed meat is putting a strain on my relationship hi fellow vegan i have been vegan for 3 or so year now and i never thought i'd have a problem with my partner eating meat but i'm finding myself feeling conflicted about this situation let me tell you about my partner he is a young adult from east malaysia and we have known one another for 3 year in a long distance relationship one time early on in the relationship he sent me a very long list of reason why veganism is not good most of them were health reason he now ha come to respect my diet and even support my vegan page he even sends me recipe now i've never once said anything about his diet and simply stated that i'm fine with him just a long a he doesn't expect me to cook for him the problem i have with him is the insane variety of meat he eats he consumes everything from pangolin frog insect jellyfish crocodile water monitor frog pig inside the list is endless and of course he eats the standard pork beef chicken and fish he also slaughter animal when it come to traditional native festivity this a you might imagine is very hard for a vegan to tolerate and i feel i am coming to a point where i might burst if he try to describe to me what a squirrel taste like again i know it's not his fault i feel this way because i've never confronted him and when i've shown discomfort he gently say he'll never let me see the slaughter and that i must understand it is just traditional and that this is how malaysia is it's the norm i don't believe that it's difficult to go against the norm nor find vegan or vegetarian dish there having gone myself i want to know if anyone else ha been in a similar situation and how i can change his way of eating but i don't know how to begin when i ask my parent they just say i must respect that or leave him i love him incredibly and want to show him how amazing veganism or even just reducing meat intake can be should i tell him to not talk about meat in front of me should i make him watch a documentary with me online advice needed please i need to do something asap because i find myself disliking him so much at time while trying to tolerate his diet

0,thought look at the strain we have had to go through to assert that person of x race is human the suggestion that someone is not human is an excuse for catastrophic abuse despite the suffering they would clearly have shown and the obvious mutual trait between abuser and abused now consider that they are not in fact human the situation of animal is cosmically bad the excuse is the real thing the abuser can take the glove off and hide all pretence to civility it take huge human effort to discover or act on the buried abuse of people by company or government think of chemical waste that wa found to cause cancer in a population only through the effort of investigative journalist also think of the immense difficulty of finding some kind of justice for the life ruined an achingly slow lawsuit an eventual and disatisfying fine no criminal charge and a probable ceo bailout imagine if the company spilling mercury in our water supply that stopped only because it wa caught wa able to operate in complete secrecy and with the confidence that the harm caused wa caused to the inhuman if it take this much effort to bring the mistreatment of human to the surface and to achieve the flimsiest kind of justice for people try to conceive of the quality of life of the thing used a the excuse for human exploitation and maltreatment the model for the exploitation of everything else

0,trying to become vegan but am being roadblocked by one thing medicine the point i've come to is this i could never feel good about being vegan if i'm going to continue using medicine so do i stop using medicine a well for stuff like the common cold and whatnot it won't matter too much but for serious illness which everyone ha to face at some point in their life stopping medicine could mean prolonged suffering and death so based on that of course i don't want to stop i don't think anyone doe but if i continued using medicine then i'd be contributing to animal exploitation which defeat the purpose of becoming vegan to begin with ultimately human and animal life are equal neither one is morally superior to the other so if i get sick then the ethical thing to do would be to let myself get sicker and die why should i sacrifice an animal's life to save my own but i don't want to get sick and die so i'm stuck unfortunately our medicine come from animal exploitation this could very well change in the future but at present this is what the situation is and i don't know how to deal with it any tip would be appreciated

0,is it unethical to support a non vegan restaurant if they offer vegan option prior to becoming vegan i didn t eat meat or fish all year but still ate cheese and would always eat sushi at my favorite restaurant once a year on my birthday since then i ve realized how hypocritical i wa and decided to go fully vegan my birthday is this weekend and i wa planning on going somewhere else until i found out that the sushi restaurant actually ha a vegan menu upon request i wa thinking of going and just asking for the vegan menu but i d love to hear your thought i d still be eating a vegan meal but is wrong to give money to a restaurant that make the majority of their profit from meat even if i m not directly supporting meat fish it would still be giving money to a restaurant that literally specializes in fish 
0,opinion omnis don't enjoy meat a much a they believe they do now hear me out there wa a study where people bribed 1 or 20 lied to say a boring activity wa interesting the people paid 1 changed their attitude so that they actually believed the activity wasn't too boring this study show cognitive dissonance in action however the people bribed 20 didn't change their attitude this wa because they could say that it wa the money that made them lie not themselves we all know omnis experience cognitive dissonance which lead to my question let's say taste is the bribe to abuse and kill animal if omnis say they love meat then why do they have cognitive dissonance when the people bribed the higher amount didn't the taste they experience is actually not significant it is only exaggerated by their cognitive dissonance to justify their action would this knowledge help with outreach no it is just interesting lol

0,looking for some inspiration possibly cooperation if anyone is interested if this isn't allowed in r vegan i'm sorry take the post down hello to all you wonderful green people of r vegan http www reddit com r vegan first of all i want to say three crucial thing 1 from the bottom of my heart thank you for choosing compassion over fear and suffering this is the most important thing we a vegan need to remember and remind ourselves each and every day if we are to live at peace with the fact that we are vegan in a non vegan 2 i hope to make it a straightforward a possible that my intention of writing this post is not about an egotistical gathering of attention to and around me and my work let me be the first to say that the most critical voice that i will ever hear about what i do is my own voice this post is because i'd like to stretch a hand of compassion and offer an opportunity to those who resonate with me this project of mine ha been a considerable source of personal growth and i'd like to try at least to inspire someone to join me i'm doing this because this is what i would have liked to see more of in my own ideal world 3 i hope to clarify that i don't sell anything nor that i am going to this post is not about trying to get people to watch my content it's about asking what the vegan community would like to see and hear more of for the animal together we stand strong abstract tldr what kind of content would you yourself have wanted to see produced on youtube is there anything i can help you with to make you start producing your own video on youtube are there any specific topic question or thing i can make to help people be inspired to become vegan or make vegan be inspired to become active for the animal is there any suffering vystopia which people struggle with and i can help alleviate through inspiring video and content on youtube or otherwise any other question information contact info about me or anything else please leave a comment it would mean the whole world to me to get feedback from you lengthy post with lot of detail about who i am where i'm from what drive me and why i do what i do follows so basically what drive and make me want to innovate is largely fuelled by the profound amount of energy and gratitude i get from just the simple fact of being vegan from just having the flame and feeling within me of the knowledge that every day that i live life i'm sparing animal from being killed that is what i fundamentally want to pas on to the other people of the vegan community i really want to help alleviate the suffering people feel about how humanity is treating animal i want to help people see and realize that we do the thing we do to animal because we are unconscious this is what the brand i have created since november 2020 ha turned into today metta sutta vegan activism the name metta sutta is inspired by a buddhist text about the cultivation of goodwill and it's something i really found inspiring because it's what we a vegan do towards animal this is what i've been doing in the vegan community the last few week i've only recently started being active i've been active in facebook comment on agricultural vegan group for the last month me and my girlfriend started a podcast norwegian podcast this easter it's gotten great response from our closest vegan friend and the community i have invested around 2000 dollar in hardware for creating high quality video mirrorless camera professional recording software microphone website ad etc recently i started producing video on youtube this will be my primary focus from now on i'm working intensely on upgrading the quality of those video by working on myself which is a major reason a to why i'm asking the community for feedback and constructive criticism recently started a metta sutta instagram where me and my girlfriend will be collecting and posting inspirational video quote and all thing that make the heart of vegan melt in joy from the love of animal recently became active in reddit this account is 3 day old i know me posting this may be something that i regret doing too soon still i would rather get some genuine feedback about my work thus far and hopefully some guidance on where to go from now on and hopefully find someone that would like to connect more with me from the understanding that the reason we a a human race do these thing to animal stem from an unconscious state of mind we a vegan can ourselves become liberated from the constant judging and maybe more fully start to communicate to the meat eater in more effective way that's my highest hope and i wish someone ha some thought about how we can do this i've read the book a plea for the animal by a buddhist monk called matthieu ricard and recently listened to the joyful vegan by colleen patrick goudreau i find these book highly inspiring and i want to pas along that inspiration in video and podcast format and what i'm hoping is that if anyone resonates with anything written here i would like you to get to know me a little better and work together to find out how to speak our truth to the world more effectively i'm trying to offer to create a place a circle of innovation and inspiration that will hopefully blossom into a beautiful space of support and clarity and my highest wish is that you would be a part of it a little bit more about me i'm 22 year old i've been vegan for 1 5 year now and l live in norway when i first went vegan i wa met with so much resistance from family friend and the society around me and the path from the transition to veganism to the present day ha been a really hard but rich learning experience what i really want to do with my work is to inspire vegan to live happily with the knowing that they are doing the right thing a well a hopefully helping meat eater realize that choosing compassion is the right choice how our truth need to be spoken is in a way that connects with those people's mind at their stage of development through the heart in a way that's relatable in my opinion if anyone is interested in checking me out i do have a website www mettasutta net http www mettasutta net although i'd like to mention that the website is not fully finished yet it's under construction alternatively check out my youtube channel i recently deleted all my video from other channel and reuploaded the best i've made thus far on my main channel metta sutta some are english some are norwegian http www youtube com channel ucakjcrmcwoy2fsjbf5uxctq http www youtube com channel ucakjcrmcwoy2fsjbf5uxctq if there is anything particularly good or bad about my video thus far feedback is highly appreciated i will be actively responding to whatever doe or doesn't come out of this post i'm a little bit giddy and nervous but at the same time inspired and grateful for doing this i'm hoping that i can use the response i get from everyone in the r vegan subreddit to better see myself clearly and how i need to align myself going forward to better help the animal that are suffering every day if there are any spelling error or there is some clarification that's needed please let me know

0,why is netflix trying to encourage vegetarianism and veganism is it performative activism or legitimate humanitarian effort this question wa asked on quora and i responded to it here is what i wrote tldr for below i basically use some fact from cowspiracy plus other bit of information i've picked up i explain regardless of legitimacy of activism it is the message we need to get behind thing is the post isn't getting any view and i wa wondering if that site is actively supressing it i wa wondering if people can go to the site to at least just view the post which might help it appear in people feed here is the link http www quora com why is netflix trying to encourage vegetarianism and veganism is it performative activism or legitimate humanitarian effort http www quora com why is netflix trying to encourage vegetarianism and veganism is it performative activism or legitimate humanitarian effort for someone like me this seems like a disingenuous question why doe it matter if it false or legitimate encouragement the message is definitely something to get behind considering the large devastation caused by animal agriculture the animal themselves suffer so much don t give me crap about plant are living being too that s a double whammy considering for example that the usa ha a population of 320 million and grows enough grain for 800 million people most of it go to feed livestock all that mindless consumption and cruelty just for our taste bud the first sentence of your plant life matter manifesto should be stop the animal agriculture industry incidentally the implication for water consumption in the u are stark the animal agriculture industry us around 50 trillion gallon of water annually to put this in some kind of perspective 5 of water is consumed by home compared to around 55 for animal agriculture in fact on a global scale animal agriculture us up to a third of the world fresh water that s woeful when literally thousand of kid die of waterborne illness everyday also livestock cover 45 of the world land mass having the biggest impact on specie extinction and habitat destruction not to mention animal agriculture being responsible for 18 of greenhouse gas more than all of our plane train and automobile combined some estimate put this at 51 when you combine all greenhouse gas of animal agriculture and it by product additionally compared to human waste there is 130 time more animal waste produced in the usa we re deforesting the amazon the literal lung of our planet to make way for soy production and livestock before you even think about blaming vegan for eating butt load of tofu most of that soy is used a feed for the livestock soy for human consumption from this area only account for about 6 directly so much for soy boy when you consider who is eating the most soy indirectly then the health implication of meat and dairy heart disease cancer stroke obesity etc the west health care bill especially the usa are spiralling out of control and it not all to do with an aging population just take a look at blue zone where they consume much le meat per caput they have more health in their long year take this anecdote a you will but i know how real this is one of my older cousin had a bypass operation two year ago at the age of 41 he took bp pill had sky high cholesterol and ate meat all day everyday 21 meal a week his favourite wa a nice fatty lamb curry with a few pint of lager down the pub he wasn t even that overweight then the climate change impact of all this if you don t know about this then where have you been you can t refute the claim of literally thousand of expert scientist on this matter even if a literal handful of them claim climate change is bogus okay i can concede that maybe netflix ha a target demographic which appeal to millenials and other youngster after all millennials are probably the main driver behind the veganism epidemic but here s the thing millenial or boomer netflix or regular programming legit humanity or narcissistic activism people aren t asking the right question and we re running out of time a barren wasteland cannot support a single crop let alone billion of human and their monstrously expensive taste hang on this is not only a disingenuous question it quite frankly a callous question i feel a little sorry for the person who asked it i can at least be a voice for the massive mindless cruelty inflicted by human society on the animal the planet and most idiotically ourselves cowspiracy the sustainability secret http www cowspiracy com fact 
0,gochugaru and iron i wa looking at the nutrition information on my packet of gochugaru korean dried red pepper flake and 1 teaspoon wa 45 of the daily iron intake amp x200b now i know that iron from plant absorbs differently to iron from animal and that the other food being combined with the gochugaru can affect it absorption e g if i added something high in calcium or wa drinking something caffeinated before after eating it but i wanted to share because it's a super easy way to add some extra iron to meal i don't find gochugaru spicy maybe in large quantity so all my food will be red from now on 
0,not vegan but i had an argument with a friend about egg okay so i ve read and heard a lot of people discussing egg i had a friend who bashed me for having chicken and eating their egg saying it s cruel now i am not vegan but i wouldn t really have an issue becoming vegan a in i don t have some driven need to eat meat animal product and more often than not i don t eat any animal product just by chance anyway i have a vegan friend but i don t know his motivation or anything about being a vegan he wa a lil mad at me for having chicken and eating their egg the only reason i have chicken is because my parent rescued them we also have a turkey who wa rejected from her flock don t plan on eating her and she ha been accepted by our chicken now i stopped buying egg because i know how horrible egg chicken are treated and instead of buying cruelty free i just treat my chicken humanly they have a pretty big coop with room for everyone even the turkey and a pretty big run that s safe from the animal living around my house i make sure to feed them with good feed and any vegetable scrap i have i sit with them basically everyday so they aren t startle by me entering their coop i did name them a chick but a they grew up they got le and le distinct i make sure they re comfortable and happy i do take the egg they produce and eat them and give them out to family so they also don t have to buy egg from mistreated chicken now a lot of vegan hate this notion because it s still an animal product but isn t being a vegan more about the cruelty and le about the actual by product like i am aware that chicken eat the shell of their egg i ve read mixed thing on the actually inside bit so i usually crush up the egg shell and mix it into their feed but i also have a bag of crushed sea shell just incase basically my friend said i wa still harming them by just owning them but i really do treat them a good a my dog and if i didn t take care of em they would have either went to someone else who might not have basically i m wondering if veganism doesn t include egg because of cruelty or simply because they re an animal product cuz my friend seemed pretty ticked but i m treating them well sorry for any spelling or grammar error

0,tldr farmer on bbc news say eat meat to save rare animal from going extinct and i am confused so i wa just watching bbc news a i wa getting ready for work and there wa a news item on a new list of endangered and at risk farm animal they did a whole piece about how certain pig and certain goat and sheep were at risk or completely rare and then at the end of the piece when the farmer wa asked what we can do to ensure that those animal don t go extinct the farmer said eat meat look for locally bread meat and make sure you choose that i don t really understand this surely the best way to keep animal from going extinct is to treat them well keep them alive and safe i do understand that supply meet demand so the more people that eat meat the more pig or goat or whatever will be out there but surely the first thing you would do if an animal is at risk is stop sending them to slaughter house perhaps i am overestimating the world value on animal i forget sometimes that a lot of people only see them a meat snd nothing else

0,i live in an apartment and the neighbor's dog won't stop barking what can i do the neighbor above me have a dog who is constantly barking during the day that's not an exaggeration it go on literally all day and i'm listening to it right now i manage to tune it out pretty well so the annoyance of the noise is not really a concern what i'm much more concerned about is the wellbeing of the fuckin dog for a few reason 1 dog don't just bark all day for no reason right sure some are more rowdy and hyper than others but it life on the third floor of a building what doe it have to bark at that it can see out the window 2 the dog sound choked the barking doesn't sound playful it sound more like gasping and yelping and sometimes it quiet down for a minute and instead i hear low slight howling before the barking pick up again 3 the sound always come from the same part of the apartment i hear it much more clearly in one room than i do elsewhere in my apartment 4 the people have lived here for at least 5 month and i have never once seen them walking a dog outside or even taking a dog out to go to the bathroom real quick my roommate who hasn't been working for the last couple month and ha been here a lot ha also never seen or heard any sign of the dog going outside i wouldn't have thought much of it until i realized those last two point would it seriously be possible that they're keeping the dog in one of the room and not taking it outside if so how the fuck do they deal with the dog going to the bathroom i have no sense of smell but my roommate said she doesn't smell anything suspicious i just don't wanna take any rash action i knocked on the door upstairs and the guy answered but he spoke almost no english i think he thought i wa just telling him to keep his dog down i don't wanna call animal control because i'm worried they will just euthanize the dog or some shit seems like most organization are always so quick to do that i think my best bet is to ask the property manager if they could just go in there and take a look at thing but that might also result in animal control coming are there type of animal control place that i could contact that would know how to better deal with this situation or should i just assume the dog is okay and just leave them be i don't know what to do so i'm turning to my fellow vegan

0,let talk about hunting disclaimer i am not actually vegan and don't ever see myself being vegan i can understand the benefit of vegetarianism and could one day take that route but currently believe veganism is actually ethically counterproductive thats a discussion we can save for another time anyway i wa having a debate with my significant other the other day about hunting this isn't pertaining to illegal hunting poaching or any form of hunting that actively kill an already diminishing specie this is more in regard to sport hunting and other legal form of hunting my significant other is vegan so anyway i personally feel a though hunting isn't a bad a it is made out to be my so felt quite the opposite she basically stated that killing any animal under any circumstance is one of the worst thing you can do although i do agree to some extent i do believe that there is a lot more to take into consideration than just the death of the animal in particular i made the argument that sport hunting and the industry actually doe bring about a lot more good than people realize a lot of hunter pay for permit and in some case of big game pay thousand of dollar to kill one animal this money is often put back into the land used for preservation purpose a well a funding security for those animal which are often poached the documentary trophy discus this particularly well in my opinion if if were not for this money put back into preservation i believe that a lot of forgotten land would be taken advantage of by big business for development purpose additionally in the case of invasive specie it can actually be beneficial to hunt those animal a to preserve the indigenous population my so however did not feel the same way at all she said that no matter the circumstance hunting is ethically wrong and should be looked down upon at this point i decided to bring up the famous ethical trolley problem instead of giving her the situation using people i instead used deer would it be okay to kill 1 deer if you could save 100 deer from death she wa very turnt off by this question she first tried to say that she would not make that decision but would rather die before making it at first until i pressed her she eventually landed on not killing the 1 deer because she could never be the person that determines the death of an animal i thought this wa a bit of a cop out and explained to her that one would then assume that she is basically letting the other 100 deer die she argued that it wa a ridiculous scenario and not one that can be related to ethic at all that i should not have brought up that situation when discussing animal activism oh well anyway my point wa to say that hunting legally may result in the death of a few animal but at the same time it could bring money to help preserve many more animal and environment ultimately then if done correctly hunting wouldn't be so bad and instead could have positive benefit especially since it is already so hard to fund land preservation and hire lawyer willing to fight against big business for this purpose anyway that wa a brief rundown of the discussion at hand i know she value the opinion of this community so i am posing the question to you guy what are your take on hunting amp x200b appreciate the time you've taken to read this post i know it's a long one look forward to some good discussion

0,best vegan documentary recommendation hi guy my partner ha reluctantly agreed to watch a vegan documentary with me this evening but now i'm feeling the pressure to show the perfect film what do you think will be the most effective i think it would be best to focus on the ethical arguements before going onto environmental one in another film another time earthling is the only vegan documentary i've seen or at least wa able to watch up to a certain point the problem that i have with earthling is that it open with the pet segment which i personally find one of the most distressing part but my partner already agrees in adopting animal so i'm concerned we may not make it to the segment on animal used for food which is the main bit i want u to see there's also the issue with the footage being older and i believe mainly from the u which open up for false rationalisation that the scene are irrelevant to our situation the other documentary i know of are dominion and land of hope and glory which i think would be good since it's set in the uk where we are but i'm not sure what suggestion do you have which film do you think is the best to promote veganism thanks 
0,watching movie this post may seem strange to a lot of you but it is something that is in my mind for quite some time now i don't mean documentary or educational film but movie we watch for entertainment and how becoming vegan ha affected my perception of those let me give you an example i consider forrest gump a one of the greatest movie ever made the story character and music are just phenomenal but since i stopped eating animal i just hate the whole shrimp boat arc especially the scene where they start catching them big time i think it is safe to assume that those were real shrimp and not just prop would it make a difference i mean i had no problem killing whale in ac black flag a i had no problem with killing human there too now of course i know that this world is not vegan the people i interact with and i rely upon aren't vegan well most of them aren't and most song writer and movie maker aren't either and i still like their product and i'm not really someone who need a safespace to escape from this not judging if someone doe but scene like the one i mentioned are just reminder that most people who watch them don't even consider this wrong or something so i guess i'm just curious if some of you have ever given thing like this a thought or if it doesn't really bother you peace out 
0,zinc and other supplement depression do you supplement your diet i noticed getting depressed and an inability to process sugar after doing some research i found i may be zinc deficient i've been vegan for about 20 year and been fairly antisocial at time but also content on my own there's a condition called pyroluria which is a deficiency of zinc and b6 because of modern farming technique the soil is getting more and more depleted of mineral i found after supplementing with zinc and b6 i felt a lot better i think veganism is amazing but we may have to supplement in fact it's thought that are 2 billion people who are zinc deficient so it's not just about veganism vegetarianism

0,synthetic meat cultured meat is not vegan synthetic meat still come from animal although we don't get them from slaughter it's still not vegan that doesn't mean it's bad or morally questionable this is the thing i'm wondering about if artificial meat becomes the norm it's a huge step in the right direction but it might not bode well for the main concept veganism abstain from animal product in general doe this mean in the future it's acceptable to refuse veganism a long a you don't contribute to slaughter or maybe you think synthetic meat is vegan if so i want to know why you think so p s i'm not saying we shouldn't welcome artificial meat i'm merely wondering about the definition of veganism and what it mean to become one in the future

0,alpha food is it really vegan so i tried these the packaging said vegan honest didn't have my glass on at the grocery store and saw all the rave review on this site and then i read natural flavor in the list of ingredient they also list separately vegan natural flavor so i called them the rep i spoke to told me he wa a 40 year vegan that they were vegan certified after watching seaspiracy i am even more skeptical of certification and that it wa probably a misprint and also that he would send an email to someone to figure out the mistake and correct it all great until i asked him to contact me with the particular of his finding a in what is the difference between natural flavor read chicken and vegan natural flavor and why they listed both i am no dummy i have been doing this for 35+ year it is well known in the vegan community that 'natural flavors' is a massive red flag labeling law are there for a reason and company do their best to hide information that might appear off putting to potential consumer and packaging isn't cheap company need to buy a minimum of 80 000 lot to get a small break on the printing of plastic to not proofread ahead of time with this large of scale seems a bit off so this is where the rep seemed to get defensive can you email or call me when you find out what is going on with the labeling response i already cleared that up i pressed him a little more and realized that he wa not being cooperative and that i wa wasting my time he cleared up that i wa confused which is b because the confusing label is why i called in the first place i have never seen labeling like this ever there is a reason they listed flavoring twice with 2 different heading i am not sure why what are 'natural vegan flavors' ground up vegan the packaging say vegan but there is no sign anywhere of an oversight body company or whoever declared them to be vegan certified by whom exactly i really want to believe the rep i spoke with but the defensive posturing and refusal to clear up the confusion or rather write it off a probably a packaging mistake and refusing to follow up smell like trouble if it look like a duck walk like a duck is labeled like a duck and taste like a duck my hope with posting here is to get help pressuring them for an answer in writing the rep may very well be on this forum i look forward to hearing more

0,addressing the graphic depiction of nh animal abuse i see it more and more people post picture of graphic depiction of nh animal abuse without any sort of tag or filter these image are triggering in nature and while they have a place to be shown should be enforced a having to be tagged a nsfw i'd go so far a to say that it is actually speciesist for u to not treat the victim in these image with the same respect that we would a human when the image of a human is graphic we acknowledge the graphic triggering and disturbing nature of the image by tagging it a nsfw when we post the same image towards nh animal abuse however we often leave now some may say that one could just look at another sub and leave this one but it written well in the rule under nonvegan post gt do not under any circumstance post content such a recipe food picture news cross post and so forth which include glorify or display the result of animal abuse exploitation or cruelty this may result in an immediate ban and post will be removed i acknowledge fully that this rule exists but i feel like it is being reinterpreted based off of the bias that if the image is technically pro vegan or if the image are somehow spun in a pro vegan way then it seen a okay it really isn't especially when you're dealing with such triggering content that often go untagged and unflaired if i'm going to bring up a problem i like to propose solution to go along with it so these are mine make the rule regarding this content it own rule rather than falling under the category of no nonvegan post this would allow u to report with the correct context especially because a post can technically be pro vegan yet still break the rule specify in greater detail what is considered by the mod to be graphic image and under what context are they or are they not accepted and how they are to be responsibly posted i'm not saying this is exactly what ha to be done i just want to start the conversation i'd also really love to hear the voice of other people too on this including mod

0,not a true vegan please please please read everything i say before judging me or the title give me a chance before you downvote and ban me so i've been having moral conflict and it's really bothering me disclaimer i became vegan for the animal and i am in no way claiming to be a victim they are the victim only them i am simply making my point and asking for help on the matter because i am seriously at a loss i now look at meat completely different it's just flesh from an animal that lived a very short and horrendous life but when it come to dairy and egg i cannot seem to look at them the same way now before you scream at me i am fully aware of the horror behind the dairy and egg industry and i am in no way justifying what happens to these animal who deserve a fulfilled life egg and milk are unethical period no matter how it's done what i am saying is that though i oppose animal use of any kind especially dairy egg and flesh industry i find myself still being inconsistent i don't like it i just never see the mother getting her baby taken away everytime i see there's milk in a product maybe it is because i am a selfish human being i do not drink milk nor egg but sometimes i get lazy and i don't bother to check ingredient or i eat it anyway even when i know it ha these product please a i said i want to change and be more proactive for the animal hate comment are not going to help it would really help if someone could give me some insight before you start saying oh well you're not a vegan then you're plant based i am not plant based and i want these animal free just a much a anyone else but i find it hard to stay committed because i am just lazy and a i said i do not feel the remorse a i do with meat and even real egg and real milk it seems like it's an effort and selfishness issue on my part please tell me someone ha got to relate to this at least a little bit i know i love these animal so why am i doing this why don't i see it a much a with human or dog and cat i feel like society's stupid norm will never escape me subconsciously and i will never be able to fully see it but i don't want that i want to change greatly 
0,if you are an ethical vegan become buddhist or jain and get more right or create new religion buddhist or jain follower tend to have a vegetarian vegan diet in most country religion ha a lot of power in regard to your right while buddhist or jain follower are not strictly vegan religion is flexible and some can consider vegan the right way to do thing and vegetarianism a not enough the same way some muslim consider certain thing halal and others arent many of u are required to do certain thing that we would not be required to do if it wa against our religious view this is the simplest thing for many of u to do now it not lying if we become follower and simply dont do anything else the religion requires muslim consume alcohol but they are still muslim catholic have relation despite not being married but they still catholic so if we become jain etc and simply dont follow all the rule we can still identify a jain this would help people in prison military educational facility where we are required to do experiment in order to pas class job that have u do unethical thing etc i also think veganism would have more opportunity to grow if it wa a religion itself in regard to all the complication that corporation create in regard to product labeling etc and other issue that i might not be aware of i am not at all an expert this is just an idea i had and in the u it not too difficult to form a religion http www huffpost com entry start your own church _n _55d24635e4b07addcb43bd60 http www huffpost com entry start your own church_n_55d24635e4b07addcb43bd60 perhaps some of u could work on that and even find a vegan lawyer to help pro bono im not very educated so i would not be able to lead this vegan religion process

0,cognitive dissonance seeking empathy guidance i ve been watching a lot of cosmicskeptic alex o connor on youtube the past few week for those unfamiliar he discus a variety of topic notably theology and philosophy but touch on veganism quite often a well it s fair to say that until recently i never really gave the concept of veganism much thought a most people do or rather don t do i suppose to get straight to the point i m experiencing some personal struggle in this regard i m sure many of you have experienced the same i guess i m seeking some guidance in my direction from here i think there s strong case to be made for veganism on moral ground in regard to the suffering of animal notably i have a problem with the current state of the food industry this is largely propagated by a life changing awakening i ve had in recent month that paint a much bigger picture i won t go into too much detail on that for now since it s not 100 applicable but briefly i am experiencing a growing resentment for the total reliance on the modern system we ve been set up to live by and only by it that being big industry and corporation this includes especially the food industry so on the topic of the meat industry our population number have increased so much in recent century that we no longer have a need to hunt for food we breed and manufacture animal for the sole purpose of eating them and often time these facility lack proper oversight you ve seen the video of the undercover investigation it s horrific it s unnatural so where do i stand in all of this i feel a growing guilt for consuming manufactured meat i could simply stop eating it but it s difficult to do when i m surrounded by people who do eat manufactured meat and have zero problem with it a it stand i recognize our omnivorous nature and i recognize the natural state of the world there s always going to be an impersonal uncaring necessary balance between predator and prey that said i don t think i would have a problem with consuming meat so long a i am the one that hunt and doe so correctly so a to not cause any undue suffering to an animal i also don t see a problem in utilizing an animal s resource a long a they don t suffer in the process this is a process so please don t bash me for holding these opinion it s why i m here to seek knowledge understanding to think thing all the way through free of fallacy and most importantly to be the best version of myself i can be thank you for any input you have i love you all

0,would black salt taste good to someone who doesn't like egg this might be a dumb as question and i imagine the obvious answer is no black salt taste like egg obviously you wouldn't like it but i wa curious after i saw a vegan scrambled egg recipe posted by someone who claimed to have never previously liked egg but liked this recipe i'm a long time vegetarian who ha been trying to go fully vegan for a while i've never eaten egg because i honestly can't stand them half of it is the flavour and i think half of it is the concept of an egg even when i ate meat i found it kinda grotesque i am however always super curious about vegan replacement recipe and i've seen a few carbonara and tofu scrambled egg that use black salt i keep wanting to get hold of some black salt and try out these recipe but i'm unsure if black salt taste so similar to egg that i'll undeniably hate it haha in short my question is doe anyone on here dislike the taste of egg but like vegan recipe using black salt x i'm just super curious now after seeing it appear on so many vegan recipe 
0,struggling with vegan parent i have been strictly vegan for over two year my mom ha recently said she ha become vegan for her health i tell her that she is in actuality on a plant based because veganism is a value system and lifestyle against animal cruelty exploitation and injustice she doesn t seem to understand that and still wear leather and wool but tell people she is vegan i feel she so ruining vegan reputation by doing this also she isn t even strictly plant based she admitted she ate egg and bacon the other day saying she doesn t have to be a perfect vegan to be vegan and that i should just support her for trying i am really struggling with this because yes i want to support her but she clearly is not vegan and is doing it for the wrong reason and i can t help be upset by this help please 
0,what's the alternative to cow on a farm i don't see any way cow can just be let roam free cow can only be in a field for a couple day before the grass is used up if they're not managed they won't get enough grass if they are let to roam free cow will be breaking into people land running on road in people front lawn to get grass also what do you do in the winter in temperate climate country grass doesn't grow in winter all the cow would literally die they'd have nothing to eat they are completely reliant on farmer to feed them in the winter also think about newborn calf besides the fact cow need help sometimes to calve when they are born they would not survive the night in autumn winter or even spring a those night are cold and again you have the problem of if the calf is drinking the correct milk too much or too little and new calf easily get sick they need different supplement which they wouldn't get also even if those calf survived in a couple year you have a bunch of bull running around freely bull are dangerous all of this need to be managed so they need to be owned by a farmer on a farm i don't see how they can be allowed to roam freely

0,getting beyond fake meat or meat shaped item one of the more annoying aspect of eating vegan is the presumption that half our diet are supposed to either taste or look like a traditional meat dish i don t mean to criticize anyone personally if this is where you are at but doe anyone else find this irritating eating vegan should mean liking different food stuff and flavor can you imagine if we called ground beef meat lentil etc etc why should we do the opposite i m an american so i can see how burger and dog are standard food that there should be vegan version of but at some point eat some food that wa always vegan like indian dish bean dish vegetable stir fry etc real vegan food is also more affordable to since no one had to struggle to congeal 10 ingredient into a meat like form that s not actually meat any other thought here

0,worry about long term effect of veganism from a short term vegan hey y'all i've been vegan for a bit more than a year now and i generally feel fine lately however i've fallen into a hole of testimony from people who started noticing bad health effect from their vegan diet after 2 year or more i don't know what to believe because evidence seems to be scarce on either side it's basically anecdotal all the time but i really am worried that i am ruining my body by sticking to my ideal i really feel disgusted at the thought of going back to eating animal product but all this stuff is making me scared that there is no way to maintain this diet for several decade without it affecting my health i don't mean to discourage anyone reading this from engaging with a vegan diet i'm just having a lot of doubt and i don't know how to deal with them

0,a very sad situation a call for advice hello everyone thank you in advance for taking the time to read we'll cut straight to the chase here i recently accepted a new job i am a bartender at a bar which ha been absolutely great although the building is rather old why that's worth bringing up is because it allows the entry of at least several mouse you can probably imagine the attitude towards them harboured by the nonvegan management who are honestly good people just not one who happen to be vegan i am vegan myself and love animal but i am also aware of the sanitation issue they present in this case which are made even more pressing in an environment such a a restaurant or bar so i am really torn on this one amp x200b the management ha set up trap around the place which is painful enough for me to see but my biggest point of contention is that they are using glue trap to get the poor little guy who just wanted to come in from the cold and eat some pub food don't we all i am sure i don't need to tell you how horribly and gratuitously cruel those thing are i am just wondering a a vegan what is the course of action i should take that best balance practicality and compassion i know welfarism is seen by many vegan a a tepid half measure against animal suffering which i have nuanced feeling about but maybe i could at least get them to use a quicker acting trap or ideally something much much much more humane in place of that horrendous way to die only catch is nobody else there is vegan and we all know how much people traditionally sympathise with mouse or the idea of doing anything a vegan say so i feel like this will be an uphill climb furthermore i am a i said very new at my job and i must admit i would ideally like to evade being labelled a 'that guy' who get a new job and then feel entitled to tell the management how to run their business amp x200b i'm sure i have forgotten pertinent detail but that's all i have for now feel free to ask for any clarification you may wish for and i will comment back i don't know what to do but i feel a though something absolutely must be done thus i turn to you my fine vegan comrade to give me your kind and rational perspective

0,not all vegan chocolate is cruelty free if you count human a animal and your going vegan then you should know majority of cocoa is produced using child labor and those child are abused nestle hershy's and mar bar get there cocoa from those area that use slavery so kitkat vegan bar still probably got there cocoa from child labor area and some 'vegan' chocolate get there cocoa from there too i'm not vegan myself but just warning you and i know vegan feel horrible when they eat something that involved cruelty but it's just that it seems like vegan and vegan brand ignore that some food that is vegan itself is sometimes non vegan produce by using slave if vegan brand say animal cruelty free it might not be true human are animal too it's surprising to because peta promotes chocolate vegan brand and some of them get there cocoa from the area the use child labor i guess peta doesn't count human a cruelty free

0,why do people feel attacked when they're asked to consume le animal product i'm not a vegan but i definitely want to cut down on my intake of animal product and maybe even one day stop entirely but why is is that when you try to explain why it's important to cut certain thing out of your diet because it's ultimately better for the environment which everyone should want to protect are you met with such hostility why is it so hard for people to change their diet even if it slightly 
0,i m feeling upset about what happened when i ordered some food at my local taco place and i just need to vent i go to this local taco joint all the time and i always veganize my order and they re super cool about it and never get it wrong until today it wouldn t have been that big of a deal because i have bad luck ordering fast food but today it just really upset me i ordered a burrito you know the standard kind and i told the girl i need to customize it because i m vegan and i d like to sub bean and rice for the meat no cheese or sour cream she say cool no problem i get my burrito and i go home i look and there s sour cream in it so i go back and this time it s a guy at the counter so i tell him what s up and asked if they could remake it for me he say no problem but the girl who originally took my order start busting out laughing about it when he handed me the new burrito i told him that i heard them laughing about me and that i don t think it s that funny because i go there on purpose because i love the food and everyone is always super cool about my specialized order he apologized and i said thanks for correcting it and i left maybe i m overly sensitive but it hurt my feeling since i had grown to really love that place and i ve never had anyone literally laugh in my face about my belief like that who doe that so anyway i just needed to vent and get this off my chest to my fellow vegan who have probably been in my shoe before thanks for listening

0,a pick me vegan yes i am using a feminist term of a pick me girl who seek an approval of men to describe a category of vegan who seek approval of omnivore she he they is not like other vegan they are not annoying is what pick me vegan strive for which personally make me confused who are you a vegan for other people or animal i bet if animal could understand that they would not mind you constantly talking about the abuse they have endure on a daily basis the only reason why an omni would say she's not like most vegan she's not annoying af about you is if you don't talk about veganism which sort of defeat the purpose of ethical veganism a long a you don't point out contradictory morality of omnivores' action making them feel uncomfy a a result you are a cool vegan i can see how some omnivore and cool vegan can say an argument like cool vegan are the one who don't force their lifestyle onto others which is bullshit that some vegan believe if you see a person kicking a dog on the street and you call them out for that would that be forcing your non kicking dog lifestyle onto them even if so good supporting animal abuse is a shitty lifestyle and they should be judged for that personal freedom should exist up until a person's action start hurting others so i will judge until they get it i won't shut up about veganism and if you care about animal then you should too otherwise if we adapt our behaviour to omnis' liking then we wouldn't be doing our job of fighting against animal abuse then what's the point of you being vegan

0,today i had one of the best day of my life i just want to share this will be long i'm sorry for that but i'm emotional right now haha thank you for your time i've been vegan for 6 year i had always said the food is the easiest part what's challenging of being vegan is other people i've been mocked insulted and judged people had called me name even friend and family and mind you i've never been agressive or pushy or anything i believe forcing people doesn't work because people have to make the connection themselves in order to have a permanent and genuine change but i speak about my conviction if asked people always feel attacked so for a time i just smiled and keep my thought for myself not anymore but that's another topic anyways i've had a couple of boyfriend through that time one wa abusive and used to mock me and the other one tried to comply with the issue and it felt it i wa an inconvinience we sometimes went to vegan restaurant but he still ate animal when we were together he also said he could be vegan for me in the future if we lived together but that didn't sit right with me because i didn't want to be the reason anyways i began a new relationship on may last year he is amazing honestly i didn't think i could be this happy guy i found the one he's the most intelligent the sweetest the kindest the funniest the sexiest he isn't vegan but he respect i am and from day one he ha cooked and eaten plant based whenever we are together i had an amazing birthday christmas and new year eve feast we share recipe and experiment with food it is great for the first time in my life i feel that i can truly be myself with someone he listens we often debate and try to see thing from the other one's prespective so i just share my thought whever i see something that anger me or frustrates me i vent to him and he is always there for me this week he told me he started reading some thing about animal right so i decided to give him my copy of degrazia's introduction to the topic amazing book it changed my life i strongly recommend it i didn't think much about it then today we had a picnic with safe precaution and i shared my thought on the video of a vegan youtuber that had made me question my approach to veganism i think i have to change the pick me vegan behavior i sometimes have anyways he listened and then he told me he hasn't consumed animal since last tuesday he told me he ha always thought there wa something wrong about animal product food and now that he isn't eating it he feel a weight ha been lifted off his shoulder although he thanked me for speaking about the topic he isn't doing it for me but for the right reason the animal his journey ha started and i feel the luckiest woman in this planet i always thought i couldn't be with someone in the long run if they weren't vegan anti speciesism is a important for me a anti racism or anti sexism or anti homophobia discrimination is all the same for me and being against it is a fundamental part of my identity so i always wished for someone who shared my same value and i found him i'm just so happy i'm so proud of him and if you happen to read this i love you a

0,how do i get enough nutrient when only eating 1200 1400 calorie a day i have been slightly overweight for probably 6 7 year and i started counting calorie and realised i wa eating like 1800 2500 calorie a day a a 5'7 woman i'm currently living a sedentary lifestyle so have been eating 1400 calorie max the past 2 week and have already lost 4 5lbs about 8 month ago i wa getting dizzy so i started taking a multi vitamin and have been fine since then i tried to stop taking the multi vitamin once and the dizziness came back so that further confirmed that i wa lacking something even when i wa eating a lot of calorie however since i've been eating 1400 calorie i am still taking my multi vitamin but now my dizziness is back it specifically happens whenever i stand up i'm using myfitnesspal and i'm not sure if it's 100 accurate but according to it i seem to not be getting enough of several nutrient particularly protein and iron seems a though i get around 25 40g of protein a day i'm not really sure what to do a i feel like my diet is pretty healthy so i don't know how to add more nutrient without adding more calorie to give insight into how i usually eat breakfast fruit and nut bar lunch usually some variation of a salad ingredient i use often include avocado falafel chickpea bean spinach cucumber etc sometimes i'll have a lentil and vegetable soup with bread instead dinner sometimes i'll have a bean and mince chilli with avocado sometimes cheesy pasta with spinach sometimes tofu and chickpea curry sometimes a lentil cottage pie w veg etc snack i usually have 1 2 snack a day including stuff like choc rice cake quinoa chip pretzel w peanut butter popcorn yoghurt etc when i look up what vegan food are high in protein or high in iron i see all the food that i eat every day week so i don't understand what to do i eat 1400 calorie a this is what is recommended to me but could this recommendation only be good if it's a omni diet am i meant to eat more calorie a a vegan will i still be able to lose weight if so btw i've been vegan for 4 year and i've never noticed being consistently dizzy tired until about a year ago before i started taking the multi vitamin

0,people have such a twisted view of what's objective and what's a belief or opinion i honestly don't understand how people can even be okay with killing animal because they like it never mind laughing at others for not doing that all while they cry over someone so much a yelling at a dog anyway i'm not allowed to talk about it with my family because they'll say you can't bring up dog it's not the same thing you have your opinion and we have ours so while they're sitting eating lamb or veal and i just don't say a word they still don't know why i'm upset then they'll keep asking what's bothering you i know you i know you're upset about something what do you want me to answer if i say i'm upset because of the animal abuse they'll say that's just an opinion you can't let yourself get upset about that you always ruin our fun we're just trying to celebrate and have a good time i'm not allowed to be sad that you celebrate life and special occasion by killing baby they've many time told me i'm not allowed to talk about it and they get mad when i do and their answer is always the same that's just your opinion opinion are subjective you can't tell u how to live our life live and let live i respect your choice to be vegan you should respect our choice not to and yet the other day i decided in the privacy of my own home while eating in front of the couch to lick my plate my sister looked at me and said that's disgusting so to maybe give her an idea i said well that's just your opinion you can't tell me how to live my life i respect your choice not to lick plate respect my choice to do it she could not believe what she heard like i wa some kind of crazy person and said to me well some thing are objectively wrong hmm so violently killing a baby animal is just a subjective opinion that doesn't concern anyone but you and me but which utensil i decide to touch with my mouth based on arbitrary social more is objective it bug me because they always tell me what to do and say something is rude and constantly judge everything i do but when i even get upset and don't say a word because of systematic mass slaughter i'm out of line and no one should ever judge every single thing they think is worthy of judging people for seems like nothing compared to the seriousness of what the meat industry is doing to the world and yet they laugh making fun of vegan in mocking voice going meat is murder hahahahahahaha bunch of crazy another thing that happened is when i go grocery shopping to buy vegan stuff and my mom asks me to pick up some meat or dairy i've told her many time why i'm not comfortable doing that and even asked her what she would do if someone asked her to go kill a dog for her saying you don't have to eat it it's not for you don't be selfish and yet nope she still think i'm selfish for literally forcing my view on her last time i said no she say to me i understand you have your opinion and you're very passionate but sometimes you have to put your belief aside and do the right thing the right thing is killing baby animal and my belief is that i don't personally like it she doesn't realize i could say the exact same thing to her right put your belief that 5 minute of enjoyment on your tastebud is a good reason to kill a baby animal aside and do the right thing leave them alone sometimes i want to give up hope and feel useless tl dr everything a meat eater belief is considered objective or neutral and all the fact we try to express are just belief opinion or even just like religion 
0,people trying to make me eat non vegan food i turned fully vegan 3 week ago because i recognised my moral inconsistency regrading non human animal i am very happy with my decision plus i haven t found it challenging at all my parent have been really supportive overall but sometimes they try to make me eat non vegan food i ve tried to explain the ethic behind my decision and also made them watch several documentary with me however they still try to make me eat non vegan food my mum tried to make me feel guilty for making her feel guilty for contributing to the exploitation of animal my mum said that she will make a lot of non vegan food so i will be forced to eat it so the food doesn t go to waste also today my aunt offered me a beef burger i have told her many time that i m vegan because she thought i would value my taste bud more than the suffering of the animal is there a better way to respond to thing like this a nothing seems to be working 
0,how do you deal with people who know exactly what go on and just don t care i ve told both my parent about what go on in animal agriculture and though my mom agreed to watch dominion at some point both say they d never give up meat i m fine with that i don t care what they eat i just wanna know how to cope with knowing that people i love and respect are informed enough to realize what go on and simply don t care my mom insists that she can t live without meat and that our local organic farm is different from the big one she s a bit more in denial imo and she just get real quiet when i bring up the horror my dad on the other hand isn t in any denial he just doesn t care i ve told him what go on not in an annoying way i wanted him to understand why i wa upset not for him to stop eating meat so it s fair to assume he know he just doesn t care his reason for not caring is that there s no way to ethically feed billion of people and you don t wanna know how the sausage get made i respect my dad so much and i know he s a good person but it bother me that he doesn t care also he ha kind of a history of viewing animal a object in a way he ha a fish tank and referred to cheaper fish a being expendable meaning he doesn t care if they die i believe in the good in people and that most people don t care because they don t know but my dad know and doesn t care and it upset me again i m not trying to meddle in their lifestyle i just don t understand why they re like this and they care so much about our pet dog once i pulled her by the collar and they both told me off which is good of them i just don t understand why that compassion doesn t extend to other animal it make no sense to me doe it make sense to any of you if so how i d really love to understand

0,starting to relapse so i've been vegan for 4 5 year with a pretty strict diet which wa super easy to adhere to in california now i moved to texas about 2 year ago and the vegan option here are terrible unless you live in a major city like dallas austin i have stuck to my normal diet pretty well but now recently i have been dipping into eating cheese at restaurant on special occasion due to the lack of option and i feel terrible for it i switched to veganism for animal welfare and don't know what to do or how to go out with family friend for birthday anniversary etc and not eat anything for context i am naturally thin with a rapid metabolism so i have to eat frequent large portion to avoid losing a lot of weight so not eating packing my own food or hunting for something i can eat for every meal when out for a whole day isn't feasible i guess i'm looking for advice motivation

0,animal product that aren't meat i've been watching a lot of earthling ed and veganism is growing on me honestly the only reason i wa ever so resistant to vegan argument really just boil down to distasteful propaganda that i've read from certain organization that isn't a good enough reason to discount a lifestyle honestly i'm trying to put together a lifestyle that is more centered around self care and i haven't been putting enough effort into the food that i eat why is it that the total use of animal product is inhumane and not just the consumption of meat isn't the use of animal product derived from non lethal us just a result of a symbiotic relationship between man and animal is it possible for human to have relationship with animal that isn't destructive and exploitative human being sell and provide human made product like blood breastmilk dna etc is that inhumane to do or is that different than the use of animal product if so how please don't think i am a troll i just love reading ethical argument at least somebody care about something lmao

0,is 20ish year the turning point a with most everyone else my biggest regret about going vegan is not doing it sooner i'm approaching my two year anniversary soon and it's at least a start to help with my conscience about my diet prior to making the switch two year ago today i still ate dairy i wa still complicit in the torture and exploitation of poor dairy cow some if not many of those cow are probably still alive today and continue to suffer so i still feel complicit in what is happening to them because while i no longer fund what is happening to them now i wa responsible for the demand that ultimately lead to them being bred into existence in the first place only after 5 6 year after going vegan will no dairy cow suffer due to my past choice because they've been murdered but i feel it's actually somewhere around 20 year or the life expectancy of a cow when the debt can even begin to be repaid i paid for a life born into slavery and i paid for a premature death and two year of veganism doesn't even begin to make me a good person

0,so anyone watched seaspiracy yet me and the wife did and we were both quite shocked by the finding but sadly not that surprised first off if you haven't seen it go watch it basically if you haven't seen it all of u a one planet if we continue to fish the ocean the way we do are pretty much done for it seems like the worldwide power that be are determined to destroy the planet by letting actual pirate do whatever the hell they want at sea it seems like trawling is even more destructive than deforestation and the fact that the people who are supposed to be overseeing it and protecting the ocean are all offshoot of the company doing the damage it is horrific and sometimes the thought of what we are doing to our home by mistreating it the way we are doing we totally deserve to go extinct the human race could have been do much better than what it had become it make me very sad

0,how to feel okay about raising cat lately i have been troubled by cracking open four can of fancy feast per day for each of my two cat mostly we use the chicken variety so considering one chicken is harvested for about 1000 calorie and the 72 calorie can is around 50 calorie of chicken then each can is about 1 28th of a chicken rough math so every 7 day each of my cat kill a chicken which wa raised in awful condition their everyday being sufferring in a teeny cage i feed my cat this so they survive but why should their life be more important than the immense torment these 52 chicken experience per year i love my cat but i can't help but feel like having human companion that are carnivorous perpetuate the very atrocity we need to come together to stomp out i feel demotivated to help at animal shelter like i used to because my mind see helping one cat resulting in torturing hundred of chicken

0,need to vent about in law teasing me the other day in the family group chat with my in law my sil in the context of another conversation slipped in a dig at me for being vegan when i politely called her out on it and laid down a boundary saying that it's not okay to make me the butt of joke about my lifestyle she gave a totally transparent b apology saying that she respected my choice and that it wa just a lighthearted tease let me be clear that i do not talk about my veganism unless someone else brings it up and i have never suggested to her that i disapprove of her choice to eat meat literally have never ever gone there with her 5 year i've known her 1 1 2 of them a a vegan i followed up with her privately saying that i appreciated the apology but that there wa no valid reason to tease me for not eating animal that respect and teasing aren't compatible in my view that a a lifelong vegetarian i've been the butt of thousand of similar joke and that they were the source of some childhood trauma and abusive behavior by people i thought were my friend that her word really hurt me and were confusing in the context of an otherwise positive and supportive relationship i sent her this article http www nytimes com 2019 08 28 opinion vegan food html i told her that i hoped she could empathize and hoped that this additional context could strengthen our relationship a a progressive gay feminist of color i thought she'd be able to empathize all i got back gt i hear you i'm honestly gobsmacked i didn't exactly expect love and light but that curt empty icy 3 word reply wa not on my possibility list the fact that it came from a grown as woman in her late 30 the difference between how she handled the convo in private v in front of her family the total disregard of me basically pouring my heart out to her it hurt it confirms my previous suspicion about her being vapid and self centered at her core but i know that her reaction isn't about me and i know that this interaction is really a blessing because she showed me her true color both who she is and how she really see me and by extension my husband her brother i don't regret it but i'm not happy

0,i just had an a ha moment i ve 36f been vegan for almost nine year and boycotting and protesting the dairy industry is a major focus of my activism it s stood out to me a a very misogynist demeaning practice and i consider the artificial insemination process to be tantamount to rape but until this week i didn t consider the step preceding the insemination which involves the harvesting of bull semen how either manual masturbation or use of electro ejaculator device inserted in the bull s rectum constitute nonconsensual sexual contact you could make the argument that the male are being raped too i would never make the statement that male cattle in factory farm are living the high life in comparison to their female peer but it took me all the way to now to recognize the sexual abuse committed against male in the name of making dairy product and i will bring attention to that exploitation in my activism from now on with awareness of the damage we risk by considering only sexual abuse against female of all specie 
0,thank you for acknowledging the horror that no one want to lamb used to be my absolutely favourite animal to eat but i didn't see it that way i don't think i ever once imagined a lamb shank to be an actual leg of a baby not once i think i tried while eating it in a restaurant at one point but my mind just wouldn't let itself go there a a piece of food it look big but i found it difficult to imagine a limb so small i didn't let myself try to imagine it for long there's something mind numbing about the act of eating i remember agonising over menu before i wa vegan and i wa beginning to learn more than i felt comfortable with about how animal were slaughtered so i could enjoy their meat but a soon a a decision wa made and it wa on a plate in front of me all guilt would subside i imagine i'm not the only one to experience this phenomenon of instant cognitive dissonance at the dinner table for those brave enough to seek the truth and to face it head on or even those who can't face it but realise they shouldn't be taking advantage of the horror they can't bare to witness first hand thank you society ha made it easy to ignore so thank you for paying attention and not participating in carnism a far a possible and practicable our culture ha been formed in a way that cruelty ha become so common and acceptable that anyone who attempt to avoid supporting it is seen a irrational or strange thank you for being vegan and daring to imagine to see and to hear the horror that no one else want to acknowledge

0,lying about veganism okay okay is it okay ethically to not reveal you are vegan to those around you when they keep questioning it noticing that all your excuse seemingly align with vegan outcome in term of health i watched my father die of cancer it broke me every time i see the animal product he consumed a lot of i think of the agony he went through in the last stage of his life and i can t bring myself to bring that pain into my life again so i immediately go for whole food plant to hopefully prevent it a lot of my family heavily argues cancer is just in the family line while i disagree with them i m not a doctor so i don t know how educated i am on the topic so i stay quiet my father got cancer his father got cancer both died in their 50 long before they should have both the kindness member of the family sad face everyone in former association i had with them when we would regularly eat together we don t do it anymore because of reason see profile for irrelevant explanation of that heavily argued non stop that my grandfather death wa genetic thing is they eat so much god dam meat every meal meat red meat fish chicken or some other former sentient animal flesh so much bacon ungodly amount of bacon so much so that when my loving grandmother made me a bean soup she s the only one who i told i wa plant based but she s not the brightest person and never understood it so this wasn t intentional on her part trust me she put bacon in the sauce to flavor it thinking it wa fine since it wa only a bit dairy cheese so much god dam cheese milk when i wa a young child i naturally consumed the same food up until about 15 looking back my symptom were insane and really bad such that i m surprised i never considered the food i wa eating could be causing me to have these issue rash everywhere for arm shin oh my god dam finger bottom of my foot it wa so bad even when i didn t scratch it would get worse and when i did scratch i d get blamed by my family for it getting to that point it s only that bad because you scratch if you stopped it would go away nah it s not the food at all i d wake up 3 day a week seeing blood everywhere on my bed from the scrap opening up craving i d go through non stop physical shake if i didn t have dairy product 3 time a week my loving father had to limit my ice cream consumption to 3 day a week because i wa ballooning up but i wa always trying my best i swear but the craving kept getting more and more intense until i gave in depression and fatigue non stop fatigue i d be told by family that i just wasn t eating enough them proudly patting their ballooned stomach i forced myself to eat more of the garbage food i definitely ate more but my fatigue got worse and i gained weight all of this is to just show how sick and tired i wa of my health feeling like garbage so i stoped i told family my decision to just limit l said lying knowing i wasn t eating any behind closed door animal product so please if they cook just give me the non animal based part of the meal i d be more than happy to bring my own food if the entire meal is animal based tho they had to do nothing extra first they asked why i explained that i wa trying to see if changing my diet could help my symptom they told me i wa being silly it wasn t the food and that i needed to keep eating these health calorie dense food it s in our dna second when the above strategy did not work and it became clear that for about 2 month i had not gave up skin improving before their eye but they ignored that claiming i wa just not scratching i wa still scratching a lot they didn t believe me they tried a new strategy guilt tripping me they told me i could 100 cheat 1 day a week and my health would be fine when i told them cheating requires me to want to eat those food because it brings pleasure and i don t get pleasure from the side effect i do still get after eating it so i don t cheat with food that cause pain they god mad oh so your grandmother slave over a stove and you are going to be disrespectful and not eat it wow no i do eat the food she make see i m right now eating plain pasta l it s rude to not eat everything you are insinuating she s doing a bad job and making you sick that s rude what no i m just trying to figure out symptom by isolating my diet to food that work and if i add something in it will show me if my reaction is negative i disagree it s rude seeing no other way out i lied my doctor told me to do this are you telling me i should ignore my doctor this shut down all complaint once i tied it into my doctor told me to do this they had a difficult time arguing back that i m being rude although they did try and the sane people at the table would go dude doe op tell you to stop taking your anti acid pill your doctor recommended that s not the same thing this is food not medication i specifically heard you tell me your doctor told you not to eat x food group and you wouldn t need to take the anti acid pill so unless you want u to judge you for ignoring doctor order leave op alone go grandma love you so much even if you put bacon in my food without understanding why it wa bad but you stopped when i asked you not to so we gucchi so i know that wa a long rant but my point when i lie about being vegan to the awful people in my family or awful people in general it solves so many problem and allows me to live my life i don t want to be an activist right now given how bad and abusive my family wa growing up but is lying unethical and contributing to the problem even more and i should be willing to take the hostility when my family suspected i d become vegan the anger wa insane they literally told me i wa lying to do them for x y and z reason they went off on how i wa judging them for their choice and i needed to stop bullying them and just eat the dam food and until i finally lied telling them it wa my doctor advice they kept getting worse now i am away from those family member now but i just dont think i can handle the hostility associated with activism but i can not contribute to the problem is this okay

0,iron supplement hey all my question is for folk who actively supplement with iron i ve been vegan for about 7 year and mainly vegetarian for many year before that recently after experiencing a myriad of symptom i discovered i had low ferritin 26 where anything under 30 is an absolute iron deficiency admittedly i wasn t consuming a many green vegetable nor bean but i wa always eating sufficient amount of tofu so for those of you who are aware of your iron level and are consciously trying to raise them or simply maintain them what supplement do you take i ve been taking spatone but it s a measly 5mg so that likely won t help me much thus i m in the market for a vegan friendly iron that won t overload me but be something i can take consistently and sustainably thanks 
0,vegan but with the addition of fish is that technically pescatarian i know by definition a pescatarian is technically a vegetarian who eats fish but if a vegan chose to eat fish a the only exception would they still call themselves a pescatarian if they still don't eat other animal product that aren't meat such a egg honey etc just a little caught up on the definition here

0,my brother gave u an ultimatum i need some advice on how to talk to him about it so my brother 19 went vegan last year and it ha been a topic of discussion at every family dinner ever since no one ha a problem with him being a vegan my family even accommodates his diet i also went plant based for the most part and i totally get where he is coming from the problem is that his behaviour strain his relationship with our family and others he always asks me when will you go fully vegan and any effort shown is not enough for him if there's a vegan option for him it's not enough cause the whole table should be vegan a couple of week ago my parent went to visit him in his flat they brought homemade pizza and when he realised that some piece my parent ate had cheese on them the plantbased cheese had run out he kicked them out there will be no slavery under my roof now our easter brunch is supposed to be tomorrow he told u he won't be attending a long a there is a single animal product on the table and it's not like there will be a suckling pig or anything it's just about a couple of egg and some mayonnaise how can i go on about this is there something i can tell him to convince him to come tomorrow i don't want to spend easter alone with my parent it would be the first year without him any advice will be appreciated

0,least processed form of protein for vegan one of the reason i've been successful in becoming vegan is the abundance of meat analogue which serve to ease the transition most of these are heavily processed however so i'd like to cut down on them a bit i'm already aware of tofu seitan tvp and tempeh which i know are somewhat processed but not nearly to the extent that beyond meat gardein or yves product are are bean really the only thing left on the table

0,where do you stand on wool obviously i know it an animal product so normal vegan ideology would dictate we can't use it which is fair enough and i largely agree however thanks to human being dick for a really long time most sheep actually need to be sheared regularly or their coat grows too thick and they won't shed properly this lead to them dying from exhaustion overheating being unable to eat from the mountain of wool in the way so do i keep my old wool winter coat from my pre vegan day and just feel apologetic or do i continue to buy wool but only source it from farm sanctuary who don't slaughter their livestock and treat them well whats everyone's thought

0,so i think turmeric ha been staining my teeth yellow hi there i've been vegan just over a year and went to the dentist yesterday first thing they asked me wa are you a smoker no then do you drink red wine said no truth is of course yes but only seldom and basically never this past year do you drink tea coffee no no what they were getting at of course is that my teeth were yellowish or perhaps a bit yellower than is usual this make it sound like they were in an awful state which i don't believe but i guess dentist have different standard to u lay people they booked me in to have my teeth properly cleaned by the dentist next week found it a bit perplexing thought it must just have been that it had been a while since i had had that kind of dentist cleaning done i brush and floss religiously but perhaps you can never quite keep on top of it brushing my teeth last night though i remembered every day i put turmeric powder in my porridge and it sure stain the whole bowl of porridge i reckon that's it and i'm gonna look up pill or capsule so i can have all the health benefit of turmeric without making teeth yellow keep flossing kid

0,rant about my sister advice idk tl dr at the end of you don t want to read all this haha so i ve been vegetarian for about 7 year then vegan since about august last year and my sister turned straight to vegan in about november december the rest of my family are meat eater which obviously i don t agree with so it wa really nice having another vegan in the family so whenever the topic would come up and i would speak about how the meat animal product industry is literally killing the planet a well a it being unhealthy for your body i d have someone to completely back me up so i didn t sound like a preachy dick while the rest of my family rolled their eye it wa great the problem now is that she s saying that she doesn t really have any interest in being vegan anymore and that when the uk lockdown is over in a couple month she s almost definitely going to go vegetarian because when she s out and about with friend and stuff her option are way too limited and she probably wouldn t be able to find food and idk i think it s kind of bullshit it seems like such a tiny problem that could be really easily solved by either making your own food and bringing it out a bit of a hassle i know or just going with something you don t want to eat a much a a non vegan option but you ll make do because it s still good food it s also that she say she probably won t be able to find food she doesn t even know for sure i feel like i shouldn t be so personally upset by this especially because i don t feel this annoyed about my family eating meat but if feel like a real bummer and almost a betrayal cause she seemed so passionate about the ethic and wellbeing of animal being very anti cruelty and pro not killing the environment and now she s like ah fuck it life is easier for little old me when i don t always have to only eat plant based and it feel like she think her convenience is more important that the literal life of animal and that it seems to go back on the value she s seemed to have since turning vegan i m probably overreacting i m just really worked up about it especially because i don t want to bring it up with her for fear of sounding like a proper asshole like i m controlling her so i m just bottling it up i guess tl dr my sister ha been vegan since november and say that when uk lockdown is over in june she s almost definitely going to turn vegetarian because it ll probably be too difficult to find vegan food when she s out with friend or something i m upset about this for obvious reason and idk if i should i bring it up with her or just let it go 
0,thought on eco friendly leather alternative i recently came across an article which listed down some vegan alternative to leather like leather made from pineapple cactus mushroom and even coconut wanted to get everyone's view these material are definitely animal free much much more eco friendly and biodegradable than pu leather pleather faux leather which is made from plastic and petroleum product but are quite expensive would you be willing to shell out 2x or 3x time more money for a cactus leather product like apparel handbag or shoe rather than the same thing made from pu leather what will you choose leather product or cactus leather product same price and design but cactus will not last a long maybe 3 4 year whereas a leather product can last 8 to 10 year sometimes

0,my mother ha finally discovered that keto is a lie my mother ha been convinced for a while now that keto is the diet that is going to make her lose weight a a result she's been talking down about my diet choice for literally month now saying how crap it is that i eat so many grain because they are carby food i've told her otherwise a couple of time but it became clear that she wa so convinced that she needed egg and dairy and meat and that vegan diet were trash that i gave up for the sake of peace in my household besides she doesn't reason well well today she went on weight watcher and wa stunned to realize that the majority of those really horrible grain and vegan food that are demonized by her keto community are on her zero point list it wa genuinely shocking for her to realize that she's been sabotaging herself for month over misinformation and an unwillingness to learn and there's also that added enjoyment of her realizing that i wasn't the ignorant one while it isn't that important it doe feel good after month of being told otherwise 
0,i had an interesting thought about how to address the meat industry if one is vegan i'd like to hear people's opinion on this ha it been talked about that instead of getting people to stop eating meat ultimate goal a the main goal that focus be shift to singling out the method for which meat is harvested no i don't mean in a and this is why you shouldn't eat meat way because that doesn't address the problem directly a person could go vegan today and still million of animal will be killed tomorrow because everyone else isn't vegan so what i mean is attacking their method directly vegan could address their method with the purpose of forcing a change to alternative method that meet a supposed humane criterion a method that is used to theortically bring suffering and torture to zero if not the bare minimum for starter it known that the method they currently use are optimized for mass production not for the regard of animal at all if these method are approached with the sense of bettering the production instead of shutting it down which is also the ultimate goal this will impact production value a most way to mass kill for demand won't meet the bare minimum of suffering criterion that ha been set this should get support a most people don't support the suffering and torture of animal so if a petition is started perhaps signature would be bountiful if that reason is expressed for change in regulation if it go a expected the price of meat will rise due to new regulation of more attentive killing of animal more attentive meaning more time consuming le is being able to be produced the only option to compensate is hire more people which eats away at the business money the only way to compensate that is higher the price with price going up le people will buy or be able to buy which would effectively put a dent in production value would it not this also tie into the forceful impregnation of animal if you could prove in court that it is no different from the rape of a real animal by human hand which is already illegal you could forcibly change regulation to only have breeding done naturally if the animal are being stressed out constantly and tortured the last thing they are going to want to do is breed that would indefinitely slow down production and make meat a rarity something not a lot of people could buy anyway these realization just happened to pop into my head and i wanted to share ultimately i think the approach is good in the long run

0,ill informed friend ugh it just baffle me how people can be so ill informed on the subject i ve been debating with my friend lately and their main argument are that a vegan diet is too expensive not sustainable not plausible via land availability nutritionally deficit and not readily available the other one i love is that we can humanely slaughter animal so why not i m sorry but there s no such thing a humane slaughter if you truly consider the definition of the word it s exhausting trying to counter all of these constantly

0,vegan childhood memory a recent post of bug reminded me of this and i wondered if anyone had memory from their childhood that showed you had vegan ethic when you were young one of my earliest memory is from when i wa 3ish year old i wa playing on our patio and saw a lady bug i remember wanting to see what would happen if i squished it idk i knew it would squish but i think that i thought it would flatten and pop back up like in a cartoon i took a plastic picnic table we had and crushed the ladybug i still remember the sound and when i picked the table up it wa crushed and not moving and it didn't pop back and i realized i had killed it that's a far a i remember but apparently i screamed really loud and my mom ran out because she literally thought i wa being kidnapped or something i wa so inconsolable that i had hurt the lady bug and clearly it wa more than just childish overdramatization considering it's like my first memory idk it just make me think that if we could let kid make their own choice they would never eat meat it isn't in our nature to want to hurt animal at all i also wanted to stop eating meat when i wa a bit older and realized that people ate duck and that the chicken i ate wa animal part doe anyone else have moment like that where looking back you can see that you had a sort of vegan ethical framework from the start 
0,question for veteran vegan hey everyone my family want to go vegan we own 6 chicken and i have question i saw something on a different page that basically said i wa a monster for owning chicken let me give some info and then you tell me if i m evil i adopted a friend s chicken last summer they were getting ready to move and couldn t find a home for them so they were going to kill them and eat them i wa mortified so i took them in they get ton of veggie fruit snack love safety from local predator space to roam and access to their egg for day at a time in case they need the nutrient from their egg that they would normally eat in the wild whatever is leftover we ve always eaten or shared with neighbor they re super friendly and come up to you for love and treat one person said that they should be set free but i can 100 promise you they would die in the wild is it wrong to eat the leftover egg that the chicken don t eat themselves obviously you re not vegan then but at least your not supporting factory farming sooooo am i evil lol taking care of them and getting to know their little personality ha been so amazing and eye opening anyone who spends time with chicken can tell you that they re amazing animal 
0,any authentic chinese vegan cookbook recommendation hello i want to go vegan but my partner's family is from china i worry that when i go vegan i won't be able to connect with them and their culture very well i want to learn how to make vegan version of traditional chinese food although i have some allergy that make it pretty difficult to do substitution i'm hoping that if i have a whole book of recipe to choose from there'll have to be something i can eat any idea for book to check out are greatly appreciated i do also appreciate individual recipe if that's all you know of but it will be hit or miss if i'm able to have it my allergy are soy yeah i know that's tough for chinese food but i'm figuring out quite a lot of substitute eggplant avocado yeast garlic and this isn't an allergy but i can't have wheat due to my crohn's disease ginger also mess with me sometimes because of my mast cell activation syndrome but it's not consistent yeah this is quite the list i know hence why i'm struggling i'm hoping i can at least find 2 3 recipe that i can adapt to meet my restriction thank you 
0,why do people feel that being vegan is inherently elitist i see a lot of stuff on social medium where people say being vegan is for affluent white people even though i have heard that increasing veganism in the black community is at a higher rate and i have heard other poc from different ethnic background talk about family member making different vegan alternative for recipe that are part of their heritage i understand the type of white vegan that people are describing when they have a negative feeling to the term i am probably more plant based than vegan because i don t think i am 100 vigilant about every thing i use in my life so this is more out of curiosity of people s thought than personal reason anyway i think at the end of the day animal abuse extinction and enviornmental damage are the primary concern so if someone is passionate about industry issue but ha some farm animal they use or go fishing i am not probably going to talk down to them when discussing the matter but it seems like when people say why they chose to go vegan and share some information about some issue people get very upset and say that they are on a high horse even if they asked why they don t eat dairy or whatever any thought on this shouldn t there be more focus on food accessibility in different area and community than demonizing not eating animal product 
0,after 3 year of being vegan i m feeling really discouraged and ashamed more pro outweigh the con to being vegan and i did so for ethical reason but there are two con that i m really struggling to overcome 1 how expensive it is when lacking the time or motivation to cook 2 how easy it is to not get sufficient nutrient calorie the last year and a half i ve been struggling with the calorie factor i ve tried eating more peanut butter avocado olive oil etc but maybe i m just crazy and can t eat like that every day multiple time a day at this point i feel like i m too depressed to be motivated for basic upkeep of myself a a result my period became so irregular and i ve lost so much weight and cannot gain it back i m almost borderline underweight so i resorted to ordering food delivery literally everyday i don t have a car to do takeout and the spot i can eat at are not within walking distance with a mixture of grocery because i don t want to have strictly delivery i ve spent at least 3k in those 5 month on this maybe even 4k so i ve been getting more calorie in and my period went back to being regular 28 day on the dot for 5 month straight but my pocket are shot when i m supposed to be saving to move out so the past few of month i ve been trying to force myself to cook and eat and this is quick or easy kind of food throw it in an oven microwave etc but i don t think anyone understands how hard these basic task are for me especially if i need to cook more nutrient dense calorie heavy food plus i can t stomach even half a much home cooked meal than i can with delivery i get full fast and half the time i lose my appetite altogether people keep telling me to just start meal prep toss food in a slow cooker eat this eat that do x y and z it s not about what to do it s the effort now i feel so much pressure and like a failure because these basic task are no brainers for the average person but it s a difficult chore for me still 3 month later trying to eat from home and i thought i wa doing good with it but i m still not eating enough calorie some day i eat 2 3 time a day and only manage lt 1k calorie some day i only eat once or not at all and now my period is late last month my period came early at 26 day i knew what this meant and i ve been trying to eat more but now i m 1 day late and still don t feel the sign that it s coming yet this is what my period have looked like in the past year http imgur com a mg9lkmv eating wa a lot easier before i wa vegan because all the processed and fast food wa cheap if need be while providing all the calorie then i d just take multivitamin but being vegan is proving extremely difficult for me and i m hating myself so much for it i went vegan for ethical reason so i simply cannot stomach the idea of eating animal and i m still struggling with eating enough i m not sure why i m even writing here but if anyone ha word to share i d really appreciate it

0,hey guy omnivore here i have an entirely non aggressive open ended question so i'm very new on hearing the vegan side of the debate on animal cruelty in food production and just by reading your post i have had most of my question answered but there is one that i haven't ever seen addressed what about other animal killing animal like say there is a hypothetical carnivore that can not sustain itself on anything other then meat without compromising it's health in an ideal world would such animal be driven to extinction so that the biosphere could support more herbivore bit of a trolley situation honestly oh and bug it is my understanding that bug lack the ability to have emotion consciousness or pain so is it ok to swat mosquito and eat honey thank you for your time 
0,honest question do you a a vegan genuinely think the world will have gradually become vegan before it go bottom up im curious to hear the response to this it's been stressed that the road to veganism will be gradual but will it really be so simple not only do you have people stuck in their way and unwilling to change even if they wanted but you also have people who actively speak out about your movement a a whole even faced with your exhibited evidence simply taking these thing into consideration this would no doubt impede a gradual change to snail pace if not itself reaching an impasse knowing this is a possibility do you still think it can be done how will you confront this supposed deadlock

0,since a lot of people are recommending non vegan watch seaspiracy i thought i would throw a shoutout for my octopus teacher my spouse and i recently watched my octopus teacher on netflix and i wa blown away a simple documentary about a diver building a friendship with an octopus this film wa absolutely beautiful and impactful that said while i have had a couple omnivore friend watch seaspiracy and be shocked which should really be called conspirasea but that's another issue i have had two watch my octopus teacher and that wa the tipping point for them to consider move towards veganism with the film recently being nominated for an oscar i think it's a great time to recommend it to people and let them see the sentience kindness and beauty of marine life in a way that's le explicit but perhaps more persuasive than seaspiracy

0,for vegan activism to be more impactful it must fundamentally change it approach i ll start this off by making this clear i m on your side i want your cause to succeed please read the rest of this post with this in mind and approach it with open mindedness and self awareness amp x200b during the past decade veganism ha become a viable mainstream alternative to the traditional western omnivore diet it is now more accepted than ever and it benefit are backed up by science however it still isn t something completely normalized especially in developing country and there s still a lot of work left to do for environmental and vegan activist now in my opinion the reason why this uphill battle is so much more difficult than it should be is that mainstream vegan activism is so overly aggressive that it turn potential ally into disassociated indifferent asset peta for better or worse is the face of the vegan brand around the world and it marketing approach is horrendously hostile actively insulting people listen to this you will never change someone s mind when you start a conversation with you are wrong stupid and a bad person here s why call it immaturity overly sensitivity whatever that fact remains true that s the same reason why climate change awareness is so difficult to get across people s mind very few people have the ability to be that introspective and take that amount of personal responsibility to sacrifice something without a tangible reward for them you are right you have the truth and the moral high ground on your side use that responsibly use it a a tool and not a a weapon instead of sharing belligerent meme to fight back the status quo or the obnoxious intolerant people that you have come across with be patient instead create a platform and a space where people can feel safe talking to you and asking question and seeking help most of u have been conditioned and indoctrinated to eat meat and dairy product stop acting like it's not hard stop acting like it isn t a hardship for some to leave something that brings them so much joy i ve lived in several country throughout my life and you have no idea how out of touch you can sound when you nag people who are trying to quit meat gradually instead of instantly in third world country vegan alternative are much more difficult to acquire and the building block for a well balanced tasty diet without the help of animal based product are simply not there sometimes people find comfort in their favorite food and to take that away from them is going to be challenging but if you want to gain more follower in your movement i implore you to leave the self righteousness behind and learn to be resilient ignorant people will give you shit so what prove that you are in this for the right reason and talk to them teach them and be patient it take time for people to come around and find within themselves the answer and strength to take this kind of life changing decision all of you together need to change your radical approach i know that animal are being tortured to an incomprehensible level but if you want to win this generational war you need to do it with kindness and understanding you may think it's dumb and that people should just grow up and do the right thing well guess what that s not gonna happen by guilting them that s why there are so many visceral attack against you people are in denial and have protective mechanism you shall strip those down one at a time you may be thinking changing people is not my responsibility and you are right this post is written for those of you who already had taken on that responsibility who have already talked to your friend and family and are active on social medium and donate and volunteer your time slow and steady win the race you are on the right side of history and if you know history you understand that these thing are won by fighting methodically not emotionally this is my feedback to you i want this world to be better for the next generation and you are a big part of that but you must change 
0,why are some vegan resorting to harassment and bullying to try to get people to become vegan i'm not saying it's all or most vegan and i'm not trying to troll or start problem i'm genuinely curious doesn't harassment seem to have the opposite effect i get you feel strongly about veganism but wouldn't it be smarter to be a bit subtle about it in my experience it seems to work better when it's more of a suggestion than a demand i feel like a lot of vegan hate is because of those few who take it too far and it cause people to ignore the situation entirely maybe having a conversation about it and subtly bringing up the conversation will get a lot more people to want to at least become vegetarian to me oh yeah veganism is pretty chill there's a lot of benefit too sound a lot better than meat eater are terrible people and are going to hell become vegan or else you're shitty ofc the latter is really just an example and i don't think people say those exact word but there are vegan who try to shove that belief down other people's throat you catch more bee with honey than with vinegar or whatever the saying is 
0,kid just say no gt those who are unconvinced that the harm caused by the average child to other human is sufficient to support the anti natalist conclusion will have to reckon with the immense harm that human do to animal more than 63 billion terrestrial animal and by very conservative estimate more than 103 billion aquatic animal are killed for human consumption every year the amount of death and suffering is simply staggering gt gt if any other specie caused a much damage a human do we would think it wrong to breed new member of that specie gt gt all this is caused by the human appetite for animal flesh and product an appetite shared by the great majority of human using very conservative estimate every human who is not a vegetarian or vegan is on average responsible for the death of 27 animal per year or 1 690 animal over the course of a lifetime gt gt perhaps you think that by raising vegan child you can evade the reach of the misanthropic argument however each new child even if a vegan is very likely to contribute to environmental damage one of the mean whereby human harm human and other animal in the developed world the per caput contribution to environmental degradation is considerable it is much lower in the developing world but the much higher birthrate there offset the per caput saving gt gt if any other specie caused a much damage a human do we would think it wrong to breed new member of that specie the breeding of human should be held to the same standard reddit http www reddit com r philosophy comment mhtg5u having_children_is_not_lifeaffirming_its_immoral source http aeon co essay having child is not life affirming it immoral 
0,i try to help animal but have made plenty of mistake in the process am i a bad person hi like the other member of this sub i love animal and i often cry thinking of animal being killed this feeling ha caused me to buy 5 pig in hope of giving them a life outside of the slaughterhouse my first 4 pig i had to give to animal sanctuary because i didn't have a place where the landlord wa ok with them my mum often scold me that i wa wrong and irresponsible i don't think she understands how deeply i love animal despite becoming a vegetarian after i became one aged 12 i honestly do not regret getting my first 4 pig because the fact is they would be dead right now had i not bought them right now i have my 5th pig i will admit to you i didn't have permission from my landlord to get a pig but i wa hoping my flatmate wouldn't mind however one minded the pig happened to run off at which point it wa taken to a stable pending the ear tag which i then ordered i have now collected the pig and taken it to pet boarding pending moving into a rented flat with a garden in a few day i am being totally honest here when i say i didn't look for housing until after having the pig largely because i doubted any landlord would say yes but i couldn't take it any more thinking of innocent creature dying i did spend some time with the pig for 4 day before it wa at the stable or pet boarding another thing that made me worry i'm a bad person is that i took the pig on a walk and it only walked with me half the time and it plopped down and i dragged it a bit because it wa too heavy to hold it's 3 month old but it weight almost 35 kg i then noticed part of it skin wa bleeding and i felt really bad like wow this is my fault i also find myself flying by the seat of my pant because i find most online info too confusing to understand however i have requested contact info for the farm from where the stable order pig feed so i should be able to feed it properly going forward this morning i fed it a whole easter cake i felt a bit ashamed though that i googled can pig eat dog food before taking my pig to the pet boarding i guess all this ha made me feel like i do have good intention but i sometimes think i'm some sort of idiot because of all the trouble i get into with my piglet and i wonder if something is wrong with my brain i will say my pig liked me very much it loved sitting on my lap and lying next to me it loved spooning a well and often fell asleep next to me anyways i'm open to suggestion

0,struggling with my partner s view my girlfriend and i have been dating for 8 month now long distance and we get along really well and are v respectful to one another i have been vegan since before meeting her and she is mostly veg but will occasionally eat fish chicken we talk regularly about veganism and she ha made a lot of stride since we met to improve but one thing i ve noticed is that she always seems to mention the environmental health benefit but very rarely doe she verbally agree about the animal ethic side of thing recently i just flat out said it seems like we have different view on the ethical side of veganism and she said that i wa correct and that for whatever reason the empathy just doesn t click into her value i m a really non judgmental person and doing my best to stay open and encouraging but that wa a really hard realization to come across it made me think back to all the time she s talked about how she wished she could where cashmere but it is too itchy or how she would like a goose down jacket but they are too pricey i don t know i m just venting here but i guess thats what this sub is for

0,why do people start arguing with you and then get mad when you defend your point of view this drive me up the fucking wall for example i went to visit my dad and stepmother farmer last summer i told them i wa vegan so i wouldn t be eating most of their food i brought my own no big deal right my half brother is a vegeterian slowly turning to veganism so we were talking about it in the kitchen while my sister brother in law also farmer and stepmother were speaking to each other when they heard what we were talking about they just had to start a debate about these thing i wa pretty civil but they just were so fucking wrong about everything they said the classic argument we treat our animal well and that sort of treatment of animal doesnt happen in our country and where do you get your protein etc etc thing got sort of heated on their end i just quoted earthling ed mostly and defended my position i didnt want to make thing awkward so every fiber of my being went into being calm then my stepmother said we love our animal and i replied i dont believe you can love an animal while killing it and profiting from their death i could tell it struck a nerve so i backed down but i could tell it made her very upset ever since she s been very distant and cold to me i get it i struck a nerve but what i don t get is people who start a debate out of nowhere when i tell them im vegan then when i defend myself and my position they act like im the crazy vegan who won t shut up about veganism they think i have no idea what im talking about that they re smarter than me that what they are doing is perfectly okay and that they can somehow win this debate with me and i magically bow down to their intelligence since im just a misinformed little girl dont start a fucking debate then get mad when i make my fucking point if you wanna argue about these thing then make sure you re prepared to hear my point of view

6_month_plantbased_changes_benefits_advantages i've linked my 6 month update above in case anyone want to read it i'm 35 british male and live in rome italy the friday after we locked down here for covid friday 6th march i idly wondered if i could manage to not eat dairy meat or fish for a week well that felt good and manageable so it became a month and now i'm a year in thought i should share my experience in case anybody want to hear it weight i lost it i'm about 6'2 and weighed around 81kg i didn't regularly weigh myself before going vegan summer last year i'd sometimes be a little a 73 kg but i think that's co sometimes in the summer you feel you don't need to eat much i've settled at about 75kg and i'm still eating an awful lot while doing hardly any exercise muscle definition is better more pronounced i nearly have ab waist go in more though i think i'm still using the same hole on my belt skin far better old mark not scar but just thing that are about orange or purpley which have appeared without reason at some time or another on my skin are fading or have faded completely mosquito bite seem to heal more quickly too skin on body is also somehow softer smoother tricky one to describe skin on face basically no breakout now finger crossed i wa certainly still annoying getting spot now and then despite being well past my teenage year but now my skin is clear though wearing a mask all day a lot of the time co of covid often dry out the skin just to the side of my nose but then we'll have half term i'm a teacher and i wear mask way le and it's clear that's just down to the mask last time in the 6 month update i wrote about possibly being le wrinkly dunno about that face is definitely leaner though cheekbone more pronounced nose is le stuffy blocked used to be i would put those strip on my nose to keep the nostril open while i slept now i don't need them think i'm sleeping better think possibly i'm recovering faster when i do go for a run my main form of exercise i haven't been running regularly recently but when i have i feel like that soreness i'd sometimes get in my thigh delayed onset muscle soreness is the name i think is lesser than i might expect it seems that plant based athlete recover more quickly and can train more a a result i'm hardly an example of this but did think i should say about a month ago i managed to run 12k on saturday morning and then 10 on the sunday not sure i've done that much on successive day since jan 2018 i'd done a marathon in 2017 and wanted to better my time but ended up injuring myself my usual run is 5 8 km wasn't particularly sore afterwards after that weekend either my nail are growing more quickly i'm basically wolverine people talk about having more energy i don't know about that i've always had load of energy from first thing in the morning onwards once wa nicknamed the duracell bunny possibly tmi stuff so feel free to avoid bo dramatically reduced to the degree that i don't bother with deodorant any more before i used to use one of those deo block from lush i don't work in construction or a really physical job or anything but it doe get hot obviously here in italy and even after i go running or whatever my tee shirt and my armpit don't smell too bad digestion i've never had a problem with constipation always attributing this to plenty of exercise and fruit but shall we say i have even le of a problem now perhaps i used to make 1 or 2 sitting visit to the bathroom every day now it's more like 3 or 4 suppose i might be spending more on toilet paper is this why being vegan is generally thought to be so expensive for the first few day though digestion wa interesting i didn't have diarrhoea or anything but ready access to a toilet wa useful luckily i wa working from home it even came out green a few time erection feel like they're harder perhaps last longer and perhaps that my recovery time is le used to be after i came that'd be it for that session and the little guy wa having a rest for a few hour but lately i reckon round 2 might be on the card also i did wonder month back whether i'd gotten slightly bigger when hard than usual not so that anyone else would notice it's not like i gained inch but it felt slightly different in my hand could just be that that's because it's harder or maybe i really did gain something in girth this doesn't really matter it could all be in my head i typed hand there accidentally lol it's not about to affect my relationship the difference if there is one is minimal but wanted to put it out there dunno if my cum taste better sorry end of the tmi think eating plant based ha helped me with a long term injury i got illiotibial band syndrome in jan 2018 and since then have alternately rested and down lot of stretching and exercise to strengthen and heal it and sometimes run while takign care to try to not to worsen it it seems almost healed now plant food should have helped with inflammation in theory trouble is i complicated it on one of my occasional run before going plant based and managed to give myself hip bursitis trochanteritis though this is also getting better and i also attribute it's getting better partly to time the great healer and partly to my diet honestly i don't see myself eating meat fish or dairy again i'm really happy with my diet and a time go on and now i find the animal right and environmental reason equally compelling my friend and family know i'm vegan and i've been encouraging them to try it colleague at work know and gently take the piss but they can see that i'm the healthiest person there i mean i prob wa before too so for me that make it more compelling i didn't have too much spare weight on me a far a i wa concerned or any worrying health problem but all these unexpected benefit happened at the same time a safeguarding my future health i'm able to advocate for animal right and be more environmentally friendly some resource i've found really helpful are mic

0,impact of lab grown meat i need some help filling some gap in my understanding i'm not particularly interested in consuming lab grown meat myself after being vegan for a while the appeal of it just vanished i don't even really like plant based imitation meat if it's too close to the real thing because it weird me out but i do understand not everyone feel the same and it is potentially very important a either a gateway or a mean for the wider population to go vegan so i wa thinking about this and i realised that i don't know enough about the potential environmental impact lab grown meat should be at least a little more efficient surely there's always going to be some kind of inefficiency in converting plant matter into animal matter but animal also do all sort of crazy thing that farmer deem unnecessary like moving or having any quality of life here's what i need more help with is the saving good enough for example some plant based food are more environmentally damaging to produce than others doe lab grown meat compare to some of the 'worst' plant based food is it much worse is it better is it sustainable if all of the world's meat eater suddenly switched to consuming lab grown meat but didn't reduce their intake would the sky still fall

0,crucial nutrient for vegan i made this list a an answer to another post here but i'll post it again since i think this list is interesting for everyone this list of crucial nutrient for vegan are made for european selenium for example is no problem for people who are living in place with selenium rich soil like canada or huge part of the u i also wrote down how i recommend getting these nutrient very very crucial vitamin b12 supplement very crucial vitamin d not just for vegan people who don't live in sunny area of the world should supplement it iodine also depends on your location i recommend a supplement since the iodine content in algae is hugely varying dha seed with high ala content like flax chia or hemp if you are worried about your conversion rate better supplement it together if epa crucial zinc legume pumpkin sunflower chiaseeds some nut etc epa same a dha but le crucial because ala is converted easier into epa than into dpa selenium this depends on your local soil i recommend a supplement because the selenium content of brazil nut are hugely varying le crucial iron seed dried apricot oat legume etc vitamin b2 found in small part in many food so it should add up even if you never thought about your b2 intake very good source are mushroom and almond calcium plant milk with extra calcium green many other vegetable nut mineral water etc vitamin k2 can be converted from k1 best source is kale not really crucial but worth mentioning protein legume whole grain nut seed etc lysine most crucial amino acid for vegan and one of the many reason you should eat your legume every day some seed also have huge amount energy you should consider eating more since vegan food tend to have a lower calorie density also notice that vitamin a is easy to get from conversation from beta carotene but some people i think one in 10 000 but idk the exact number can't convert beta carotene properly these people should consider eating more carots sweet potato and pumpkin or taking a retinol supplement main source niko rittenau german nutritionist specialized in veganism 
0,people posing cute animal video i m sure most of you share my sentiment on this topic but i just wanted to see what other people might have to say something that really bother me is when my omnivore friend are constantly posting video of cute animal like cow turtle pig and others i understand that when they are posting these video they are not thinking about their diet in the slightest but it seems so hypocritical to me to share a cute video of a cow when it s pretty likely that the cow in the video is going to be slaughtered ha already been slaughtered and it s those same people who refuse to watch any documentary and who refuse to open their eye to the animal cruelty that they are paying for i just can t see it without feeling so much frustration due to their cognitive dissonance doe anyone else feel similarly

0,veganism for endometriosis hi everyone i have read a good deal about veganism for health but the info seems to be more generalized so wa hoping someone might have some personal experience with this i have endometriosis and it is not very well controlled with medication most people think it's just painful period cramp but i don't even get a period and am usually in like excruciating pain almost everyday there is a lot more involved but that is the gist of it it suck i have been looking a lot into dietary change to help and have even tried a few different protocol myself such a low fodmap aip etc most of these diet are fairly low carb and nearly impossible to sustain on a vegan or even vegetarian diet i wa actually a vegetarian for 16 year and eventually started eating meat about 4 year ago at the advice of my medical team rds etc so that i could follow these plan but i just don't buy the idea that eating a meat heavy diet is helpful especially considering all of the hormone and antibiotic animal are given and it go against so much of my moral and ethic i am trying to avoid a hysterectomy i'm only 30 and wa just so desperate ha anyone had any success with veganism helping endometriosis symptom at this point i will probably head toward veganism either way but wa hoping for some insight and maybe some hope haha thanks in advance

0,vegan for almost 3 year quitting hi today i got into some conversation with farmer and actually i had the opportunity of roaming for more than a month in a soybean one heavily mechanized with lot of tech that allows pesticide go low a 20 milters per hectare a feat that organic pesticide without scientific research about their impact on the environment will never achieve today i quitting being vegan for having the insight of well if i want to fight for animal welfare which wa my main cause of turning vegan i should raise my own food and not depend on others since agriculture mean getting rid of bug and other insect yeah insect evolved for million of year too and even being a le complex life form it doe not remove them from the ethic list maybe i am killing more small life by eating a plant based diet only than eating occasionally some meat i just wanted to post here this since i am glad about the awareness that veganism raised on me and by my rejection of turning a full time farmer to raise my own food and avoid any kill since plant doe not have neurotransmitter since farming is nice but doing for the whole day is certainly not my stuff 
0,whats up with honey i've been mostly vegan for the past 2 3 year and with mostly i mean that i find thing such a whool questionable and avoid them but am not completely against this is because i can see why it might be problematic i just haven't done the research yet however one thing i don't get is the problem with honey honey if ofcourse done properly doesn't hurt the bee and it is a good thing for the environment we need more bee ofcourse i know about the fact that other bee are going extinct and the honey bee currently is one of the most common one but i don't think the honey industry is helping other bee specie go extinct and i agree that using any animal product easily lead to exploitation and that company often are questionable at best but granted that company would keep their bee properly or that you would get locally sourced honey from small farmer is there still a problem with it what are your toughts on honey a a vegan do you consume it and why do you choose to consume it or not

0,doe any other vegan ever think in the back of their mind how could you say that when you pay for dead animal whenever an omni is talking about how bad something is etc my teacher right now is teaching u my classmate and i about south africa and apartheid whenever she ramble about how horrible the pollution is over there and how they have to live in such horrible condition showing kid living in trash i can't help but get mad at her for talking about these issue when she pay for animal abuse of course i am grateful for what i have and people should never live in those condition but i just can't help but think that when anyone is talking about any kind of atrocity 
0,it make me so sad when meat eater get sick or feel horrible after eating a heavy meat meal and say so worth it though ugh it just throw all their argument out the window how they normally defend animal abuse with it's healthy or we need it to survive or protein deep down they know it's not good for them and health is not actually the reason they eat that bacon cheeseburger with a side of ice cream to knowingly end animals' life for your pleasure and make yourself sick and then say worth it you're not even considering that their life actually existed and if i ever bring that up people will say omg we're having a good time why do you have to make u feel bad and make everything about veganism although these are the same people that tell me they apparently do think about it all the time and make the informed decision that it's okay and that they just have a different opinion 
0,thought on holocaust comparison gonna start this off by saying that i m jewish i m extremely conflicted about holocaust animal agriculture comparison the holocaust is a very sensitive issue for me and when i hear non jew use it to describe what happens to animal it rub me the wrong way but i ve also heard jew do it i definitely see the parallel mother separated from baby living being being carted off in crowded truck without food or water gas chamber it s actually kind of striking the more i think about it but it also feel like by comparing what happened to my people to what happens to animal i m comparing them to non human animal and minimizing their issue what do y all think i almost feel like it s my duty to be a voice for the voiceless who are going through something so similar to what my people went through but at the same time i feel like it s my duty to respect what happened and not compare it to anything i desperately need input i have genuinely no idea what to think or what my moral duty are what are your thought on this

0,4 month into veganism it's been 4 month now i can't believe it's gone by so quickly 5 main reason why i went vegan below and wanted to thank this community for recipe and support during this time 1 health i wa obese still working on it and eating processed sugar and junk all the time thanksgiving 2020 i wa fed up and decided to make a change i've lost 20 pound since and have a long way to go but feel more empowered 2 skin acne prone here lowering sugar and upping vegetable found most successful change so far 3 energy level no more carb crash or feeling sluggish 4 ethic i grew up vegeterian and eating meat just felt nasty and guilt afterwards watching enough documentary and podcasts made me learn so much more 5 climate change likewise with 4 
0,ha anyone watched the netflix documentary the milk system what are your thought on it doe it support veganism like cowspiracy or doe it gloss over the animal abuse and exploitation i haven't watched it but it doe come up if you type in any vegan documentary into the netflix search bar so i wa curious to know if other vegan think it worth watching or talking about considering how everyone ha been buzzing about the new seaspiracy documentary here documentary like earthling and dominion center around animal welfare and ethic so they are really pro vegan and environment whereas cowspiracy what the health and game changer really just focus on the human experience in term of health and fitness the don't really dig deeper to question morality and speciesism the two documentary that present the strongest ethical case are the two that netflix doe not offer it's good that netflix ha a few plant based diet documentary but i really hope they open their catalog to more bitter truth i'm going to be watching seaspiracy this week but judging from the trailer i can tell it's not really about the animal it about the pollution and industry agenda a a whole which is fine but that really is only the tip of the iceberg hopefully i am wrong about this assumption and it really doe create a voice for the animal that are suffering and being slaughtered netflix play a major role in a lot of people's worldly education just because of their extensive list of easily accessible documentary i can't be the only one who hope they put more blatant content on veganism and animal ethic even putting already existent documentary like earthling and dominion would be a massive step in the right direction

0,i turned meat eater to vegan because of alex o'connor cosmic skeptic on youtube and earthling ed i posted this to the cosmic skeptic youtube dude and vegan reddit about a week ago and then just found this sub being the upvote whore that i am i thought i would copy paste it in case anyone here cared p this post ended up being really long and rambling so im adding this at the start tl dr i went from meat lover to vegan almost literally overnight because of alex's argument for veganism and the documentary land of hope and glory by earthling ed wa what pushed me over the edge and finally made me abandon my cognitive dissonance and excuse i wa making i dont know if he read anything on this sub but if by any chance alex see this then thank you for all your work and opening my eye to the immense amount of suffering and death that i have been supporting all my life up until this point ive been watching for a while mainly interested in the philosophical argument after watching atheist experience for a number of year and honestly when he first started doing veganism related content i wasnt very interested and only flicked through a couple of video not really paying attention but something stuck in my mind and eventually i came back to watch a bunch of it fully and i came to the realization that there is simply no valid argument at least for someone in my position for consuming animal product in the way i did i resisted at first mainly using a pretty lazy and nihilistic justification of well im such a small cog in the machine what im doing make no real difference but i felt a pang of guilt every time i ate meat this lasted i think several month then roughly a week or so ago i sat down with a pork sausage sandwich and started browsing youtube video and i come across podcast 9 with earthling ed http youtu be r btn8ajs04 http youtu be r btn8ajs04 i watch for a little while and am hit with the same guilt ive been feeling more and more often a what i now recognize to be my cognitive dissonance start to break down partway through the video earthling ed's documentary land of hope and glory wa mentioned i had never heard of him or any of his work before watching the interview link to the documentary gt http www landofhopeandglory org http www landofhopeandglory org and i wa curious so i paused that video and googled it and started watching the pork sausage sandwich is about half eaten at this point a much a i kind of hate overly dramatic language like this i dont think it an exaggeration to say that video changed my life i had heard before about the process of slaughtering animal about how they were stunned with a boltgun and then had their throat cut or how pig were put into gas chamber but i had never actually been confronted with it never been forced to witness an actual intelligent living animal screaming in pain and terror and clawing at the cage around it a it suffocated to death or witnessing a cow fail to be stunned in a setting right out of a cheesy torture porn horror movie and have it throat slashed while still conscious and it horrific writhing a it bleeds to death and a silly a it sound i remember looking at that sausage sandwich on my desk and something finally clicked in my head and i no longer saw it a just a tasty lunch but a a lump of dead meat from a tortured animal and i simply could not finish that sandwich i even tried to reason with myself that it wa just a waste of food to throw it away at this point but i just couldn't stomach it and from there the floodgate had opened i realized that if i couldn't eat meat anymore then milk and cheese were off the table too since those industry were just a bad for all the same reason fish i found were more difficult to empathize with and i almost flirted with the idea of going vegan except still consuming fish until i mentally slapped myself with how silly that idea wa can fish really feel pain i swear i read they couldnt a quick google informed me that yes fish have nervous system and therefore feel pain duhhhhh and of course i realized that ive always found the japanese whaling industry incredibly problematic so why am i applying those standard to large sealife but not smaller one ive not been vegan long now a i said about a week but honestly what ha surprised me most is this it so easy i had this idea in my head before that i would have to be some sort of ridiculous taste martyr to be vegan and exist off of salad and nut for the rest of my life and then i had my first vegan sausage and realised if i didnt know better i would have thought it wa meat alternative cheese butter milk chicken sausage etc it all taste really good what the hell why isnt this better known a for health my diet ha been quickly improving im still consuming wayyyyy too much sugar im far too addicted to fizzy drink but im eating far more leafy green veg and fruit and im really enjoying it the only problem im having now is trying not to be the preachy vegan to my family i dont know whats right at this point to live and let live or to really try and push what ive learned on those close to me i almost feel obligated to try and spread the message at this point a penance for all the suffering ive caused this wa wayyyy longer than i meant to make it and if you made it this far thankyou for listening to my rambling 
0,argumentative stage with friend over being vegan how to deal with it so ive been vegan for around around 8 month most people have no issue with my choice however i still occasionally get mocking from a few friend despite having discussion about veganism multiple time i often get comment like 'well not all farm are like that' or 'its completely natural to eat meat' ive referred them to documentary and various source but it feel like im getting nowhere im in no way trying to force them to change but often get in needle argument if anything food or animal related get mentioned amp x200b ha anyone fallen out with people because of argument over veganism and if so how did you deal with it thanks jack

0,i m officially going vegan after watching seaspiracy my lifelong love of seafood and meat crumbled before my eye it s time for me to stand up and do what s right i have two younger sister that have been vegan for year and they have tried to get me to do the same but i just never wanted to do it i guess i tried to ignore how my food got to me because the reality wa a little hard to stomach so naturally a a selfish human i repressed the fact and continued to indulge in animal product this morning all of that changed watching seaspiracy on netflix literally broke my heart i love my planet i love the ocean i love the whale i love the dolphin the sea turtle the fishies but how dare i ever say that if i am contributing to the extinction of the most gentle creature in the sea a the documentary ended my stomach initially churned with disgust in myself no more seafood i said to myself but then instantly i remember one of the whale poacher saying that he saw it no different than the meat industry and he ha a damn good point i love animal i love this planet i want to do whatever it take to save it and despite my love for meat like you guy have no idea i love love love seafood and meat i m ready to put it behind me i ve tasted some delicious plant based alternative before a per the generosity of my sister so i know that i ll be able to continue enjoying the juicy flavor and texture of our fuzzy and fishy friend plant based food have come such a long way i know this is probably a very boring and jumbled post but i don t have anyone to really talk to about it right now and i feel like such a new woman already i m ready to do my part and i just hope that the whole world can begin to fee this way too i m going in for the whole nine yard no animal product not just food will ever be purchased by myself or my boyfriend ever again i can t believe it took me so long but i m glad i finally got here i m ready to do my part to save the planet 
0,can you give me a definition of human that applies to all human but no other specie this is something i ve been thinking about lately if the answer is that no such definition exists why do you think we a a society are so focused on the divide between human and animal well besides the fact that aristotle s dumbass decided to hierarchically organize life because human love to organize in a way that feed their false superiority complex referencing aristotle s scala naturae or natural ladder 
0,something hit me today and i can t believe i ve never thought of it before so we all know there s a large number of people out there who won t go vegan because they just refuse to believe that animal are exploited and treated badly in animal agriculture industry and it kind of make sense most of u didn t realise how bad it wa either until we did some research and went vegan ourselves but then i realised nobody is denying that human are exploited in big industry people don t deny the existence of sweat shop and child labour and poor working condition and slave labour we all know that people suffer for capitalistic gain so why do we have such a hard time believing that animal suffer too animal are even more voiceless even easier to ignore of course in a society that can t even treat human humanely we re not going to treat animal with compassion i just can t believe i didn t think of this sooner

0,vegan are obnoxious moralizers because they realize ten of thousand of holocaust tier atrocity are being committed every year for decade just for fleeting taste i used to think veganism is just a fad virtue signal and while i maintain that the messaging on the issue can be better sometimes i now have every sympathy for their attitude and have decided to become a vegan myself realizing the moral implication of meat eating it is like waking up from a fever dream in cold sweat it's like those horror story where the protagonist came out of a trance induced by some lovecraftian menace and realize that everyone else is still in that trance and are being controlled to slaughter and torture for pleasure you desperately cry unto them pleading begging for everyone to wake up to recognize what's happening only to be met by zombie like reactionary out lash when you truly understand what the animal product industry is doing outrage frustration and despair are the most natural response of course in activism the tone and language must be carefully managed a to not provoke a reaction from the public but after becoming a vegan i absolutely get why people in the movement have this emotional outcry for others to change 
0,what plant company should we avoid my goal of being vegan is to minimize the suffering of others a much a possible i feel in order to live by this standard i must consider the ecological environmental impact of everything i eat unfortunately just about everything we eat will have a negative impact in some way it could be habitat destruction inefficient use of scarce resource heavy pesticide use or energy intensive production method obviously plant are going to be le negative than cow chicken pig fish etc but are there plant that are too negative to be considered ethical i know palm oil is something a lot of people avoid due to the habitat destruction it cause i've heard almond use more water than is worth the protein they produce are there certain company with overly negative production method 
0,i'm curious why did you choose to go vegan and would you eat egg if they were your own free range chicken hello obligatory i'm not a vegan but i've been enjoying more tofu and plant based meal a of late i still don't mind eating meat but i prefer not to when i have the option i did have a genuine question though if you raised your own chicken just for fun would you eat their egg i ask because i used to raise poultry not for meat purpose and they were always producing egg the hen if no rooster wa present would rarely be broody they were rarely broody even with a rooster so the egg were just left in the nest i understand going vegan out of concern for animal and their treatment but in this case no animal is being harmed and it keep animal like snake and raccoon out of your coop because they know there are no egg is there anything that make eating these egg unethical in your eye or would it be okay because you own these chicken and they're free range not being forced to live in terrible condition to maximize production i'm just genuinely curious i choose vegan option at the store when possible if i have the budget for it since it can get expensive but i spent the majority of my childhood raising chicken and just couldn't get this question out of my head i do understand not wanting to buy egg in the store because of the horrible condition they keep chicken in i would also just genuinely like to know what made you choose to go vegan question aside did you start out vegetarian first or did you hop right in i hope none of my question offend and thank you for taking the time to read this i just want to become more educated on the topic and understand it from a different perspective i chose to post this here not r debateavegan because i wasn't interested in a debate i just wanted to understand veganism more if you feel like it may belong better there then i can move it

0,keeping old leather textile i still have some old leather shoe jacket and belt and i don't think i want to get rid of them i feel guilty wearing them and feel some shameful obligation to hide them to prove i'm vegan now but in my logical mind i feel like no longer using those thing would be wasteful and the thought of getting rid of them somehow make me feel worse i feel like i have a responsibility to get a much use out of them a i can to prevent waste of the animal product i already have that are decade old it may be against the vegan moral philosophy to continue to utilize these thing but i'm personally significantly le concerned with something a abstract emotional and personal a moral consistency a i am with reducing actual harm and improving condition for everyone is there is a good philosophical justification for ceasing use of old leather stuff i've reflected on why i feel guilt anyway and i've decided that it's all just emotional guilt with it only basis in some code and no basis on my actual impact on the world on the result avoiding waste seems like the most positive action i can take i wanted to know what you guy think

0,on the suffering of wild animal while the 100 billion land animal + 3 5 trillion fish murdered every year by human is of course the primary concern a it should be we should focus on alleviating the suffering of the animal that are slaughtered entirely needlessly and gratuitously before all else and i m not trying to take away from that i still think the suffering of wild animal is something that ought to be taken into account if not now then in the future elephant have only one set of teeth in the wild elephant who grow too old die of starvation because their teeth have worn out this doe not happen in captivity because they are given special attention and are allowed to peacefully die of old age don t all elephant deserve this fate i would certainly argue there is not a single elephant that deserves to starve to death yet this happens quite regularly there are a lot of argument against human alleviating animal suffering but i think only one work we do not yet have the technology to prevent wild animal suffering on a large scale without doing tremendous harm to the environment however i do not believe this will always be the case and i think every other argument made against it is extremely unconvincing 1 argument this is anthropomorphic because good and bad are human term refutation an elephant dying of starvation in a field of grass is bad if you disagree with this point then i m not sure anything can be done to convince you otherwise 2 argument human should not interfere with nature this is arrogance refutation human interfere with nature all the time we re currently causing the biggest mass extinction in 65 million year every time we take medication we are interfering with nature every time we chop down a tree we are interfering with nature when we do something awful something that s catastrophic on a global scale cruelty apologist look the other way but when we suggest doing something that prevents suffering in animal they re all oh let s not interfere with nature give me a break wild animal who have undergone predator attack suffer from ptsd nature is generally a terrible place thriving on suffering granted place like slaughterhouse are infinitely worse a they re designed to cause permanent suffering but we shouldn t let bad thing happen only because there are worse thing going on

0,is seaspiracy drawing the wrong conclusion from all the right evidence i'm going to keep this short and sweet because i'd rather see discussion than read my own thought obviously the main conclusion to the documentary is that sustainable farming only sustains the problem and veganism is the way we can fight against our extinction let's be honest that's what we are facing extinction but is this reductive or at least is this not seeing the forest for the tree global capitalism is the reason human are incentivised to fish animal into extinction to force people into life of slavery to overproduce diseased meat for the cheapest cost to maximize profit why doesn't the documentary finger global capitalism a the root cause for coming ecological collapse while i agree that veganism is certainly an important part of reversing climate catastrophe a long a capitalism is in place this wholesale devil may care destruction of the planet and it organism will continue are there any counter thought on this if the film wa right to couch veganism a the solution to mass extinction explain it to me my big gripe with the film is that it seems almost dismissive of the larger economic structure that allow this to continue besides noting that these fishing industry are huge money sink and corrupt a all fuck

0,a discussion on zoo i know i'll probably get a lot of hate for this but it's something i need to get off my chest and am genuinely interested if people are willing to have an adult conversation about this a a vegan and animal lover i also don't hate zoo i follow a lot of vegan page on instagram watch vegan youtubers and over and over i see nothing but hate for zoo saying they should all be closed and that everyone who visit one should be cancelled etc usually attached to some old photo from third world country zoo with animal living in horrible condition my belief is that in an ideal world zoo's wouldn't exist and every animal would live freely in it's natural habitat but sadly we don't live in an ideal world we live in a world filled with pollution habitat destruction hunting mass scale farming over fishing destroying the ocean and in this world zoo's sadly are vital for the care of wild animal i work in this industry and see it all from the inside so i find it upsetting when some vegan are so quick to judge and so short sighted on zoo i work in a small town wildlife sanctuary at this sanctuary yes we do have animal on display that are captive animal and can't be released to the wild and yes we charge people ticket to enter because that's the only funding we get but behind the scene we have a hospital where we rescue rehab and release wild animal hundred per year who never see the public and have limited contact with human and what do we do when we get a case we can't handle we take it to the zoo we are a small establishment with limited facility but we have a good relationship with the local zoo which ha an amazing big animal hospital we get everything from pelican with fishing wire down their throat to wombat who have been hit by a car but one thing is consistent to almost all of our rescue and that is that they are needing to be rescued because of interference from human in one way or another we caused the problem so we feel the need to help fix it also my sanctuary is almost entirely volunteer run we work long hour mostly outdoors in all sort of weather for zero pay just because we are passionate about helping animal i also recently visited another much larger wildlife sanctuary in a different state which had about 200 300 animal on display but in 2020 alone they rescued rehabed then released 14 000 wild animal just in one year and the truth about this is that no one else can really do this but zoo people take injured native wildlife to vet but vet rarely know how to treat animal outside of cat and dog and they usually just sit in a cage until they can be transferred to a zoo or specialised wildlife carer between breeding program of endangered animal to all the rescue work with zoo hospital to the extensive conservation work done worldwide to help ensure the future of wildlife etc zoo are now vital to our world if you like animal i see this all from inside the industry so it's kind of frustrating to see vegan pointing to thing like tiger king or third world zoos' or other horrible abusive attraction and using those to say all zoo are evil and should be closed if all zoo's closed overnight it would be devastating for the world's wild animal it's the sad truth zoo's aren't all made equal worldwide yes there are some horrific sad abusive zoo's and wildlife attraction that i wish would close a much a anyone but that shouldn't diminish the good amazing zoo and the people who work at them tldr i wish vegan would actually research what go on at zoo before judging them all so harshly or judging them all by the worst example of zoo on the planet

0,did anyone else have vegan realization a a kid i remember when i wa 5 or 6 year old my parent took me on a boat trip during a holiday after we got off the boat and took a stroll around the dock i saw some men scaling fish with the back of a knife it wa a violent scraping and scale were flying in the air but the fish were still alive during the process they were wildly flopping around on the workbench a the men tried to hold them down a a little kid seeing this i wa utterly distraught and it literally traumatized me to some degree the memory and the sheer callousness of it is still etched into my mind a few year later when i wa around 8 my mom had gone grocery shopping and prepared a dinner for the family when she called me to the table there wa a rack of lamb sitting on a platter seeing the little ribcage on our table like that is when the connection between the animal and my food suddenly became really salient it wasn't food it wa part of a corpse i remember being horrified protesting to my parent about it storming to my room cry i knew how precious lamb were and would have done anything to protect them since then i had an aversion to any type of meat with visible bone in it sidenote my grandpa had a flock of sheep and in the springtime i'd get to go and play with the lamb year later i would find out that he'd always choose the juiciest one to be butchered and then we'd eat it flesh during christmas dinner and other holiday none of my family bothered to tell me where the meat came from there are countless more example a a kid i saw animal frantically pacing back and forth in tiny zoo enclosure watched lobster get chucked into boiling pot of water etc i've always found it absolutely horrendous yet i still didn't go vegan until i wa 17 perhaps most child are vegan at heart but succumb to the pressure of conforming to social norm a they grow older especially being told the happy cow spiel and all that do any of you have similar story 
0,aborted fetus in food we all know food ha animal product and a vegan it is our job to avoid causing unnecessary harm to them by not eating animal product however i've now learned that in addition some of our food and beverage may also have aborted fetus from baby example of vegan food and drink include pepsi and it other drink gum and coffee creamer a vegan i would like to know is it ok to eat these product or should we boycott them is this cannibalism or can we eat this this doe sound creepy but in my personal opinion aborted fetus aren't sentient yet and aren't really causing harm to anyone but they could be unhealthy and addictive tell me what you guy think 
0,perception and use of nonhuman animal image something i think about a lot lately is why we share some of the image we do and how the fact that the image are of nh animal affect our sensitivity around them even a vegan is this something that anyone else ever think about like sometimes it seems a though people share image of nh animal abuse with a generalized statement just sort of post those image without any real activism or intent and it just to share here among other vegan and of course the picture just get upvotes but no serious discussion is ever happens it just make me wonder would this happen if it were a human in that picture are we really separating ourselves from speciesism if we're treating picture depicting nh animal abuse in a different light than we are picture of human abuse i just wonder if people think about what they are sharing and why and what they hope to accomplish by sharing it and if that sentiment would be deemed appropriate if it were the image of human i don't know doe anyone else think about this 
0,i passed by a livestock farm during my run it s early in the evening and spring ha come the sun still hasn t set i passed by a farm in my area during my run it wa peaceful and quiet at this time but i felt sad because i know that the cow and duck in the farm are anything but at peace the large space they seemingly have the one outside anyway caught me by surprise it wasn t like the one in vegan documentary where animal are cramped inside tight space but it s all the same whether so called free range or not they still face the same cruel and heartless fate they don t deserve seeing the farm made me sad and powerless i can t ignore it i know i ll go back and pas by even if it gave me serial killer vibe and the smell is not the best i m still hopeful that someday it ll change that we can find alternative job for these farmer and give all animal the respect they deserve

0,when wa the first seed planted into your mind and how long did it take for you to go vegan first of all i wanna apologize for my bad english i'm not a native speaker but i want to share my story and hear about yours when i wa young i thought vegan were crazy and i remember joking around with my brother about those protein deficient and opinion forcing plant eater i knew about the fact of the inhumane circumstance of lifestock farming and the outrageous consequence for our enviroment but never reflected on them this all changed when i wa 13 in early 2016 i wa eating my favourite dish spaghetti bolognese when i scrolled through the trending youtube video and a video called fleischkonsum zerstört unseren planeten meat consumption destroys our planet by the german vegan influencer luna darko came into my sight she would influence me pretty much in the following year on what person i want to be in the future she seemed pretty smart and empathic and often talked about self love self discovery feminism etc sadly she deleted this video and distanced herself from the label 'vegan' last year at this time i wa very open and interested in enviromental topic so i clicked on this video i remember listening to what she had to say she sounded very calm polite and friendly but you could also tell that this wa a very important topic to her she talked mostly about the eniviroment but also about the connection to starvation deseases and health issue and ethic i remember when she said i know this might be the least convincing point for most people which i think is very sad cause we should care about this but a pig ha the same cognitive capability a a 3 year old human but for me it wa one of the most convincing point beside those about the complex social structure and emotion of cow and chicken in the following day i gave frequent thought on this matter and decided that i want to be vegan myself someday but not now my father cooked much meat at this time and i don't wanted the social stigma of a male vegan for some reason i didn't even made a first step in the following year but i knew that becoming vegan wa the only right thing to do i informed myself further on this topic and often argued in favor of veganism but when a dairy or meat product wa on my plate i forgot about it i devoloped a hobby in cooking in 2017 and became the chef of what i eat i reduced my flesh consumption but still ate much of it this changed in march 2020 when my school stopped because of a global zoonotic pandemic and i decided to make the first step and got veggie i knew that this wasn't enough and that i still wanted to be vegan someday but i loved cheese which of course i knew isn't a proper reason to eat it but nevertheless i still ate it my father with whom i live with wa very supportive beside often making stupid joke and statement i became very interested in health topic and started practising and eating more vegetable fruit legume and whole grain i read many book and article and nearly became obsessed with nutrition so i discovered niko rittenau german vegan nutritionist and dr michael greger and read their book vegan klischee ade maybe the best book on nutrition critical nutrient and debunking nutrition based stereotype about veganism sadly it's only available in german and how not to die which had many shocking fact in it so i decided to finally go vegan on my 1st anniversary of becoming vegetarian it's been one week and it's a miracle there were 2 3 day in which i craved for cheese but now i don't even miss it anymore despite our fridge being full of it i am very happy that i'm finally vegan and regret that i haven't done it sooner but now i'm excited to hear about how your first seed wa planted

0,why don t more of u suggest a gradual change away from animal product rather than an immediate switch to veganism i understand the moral argument and it make me mad thinking about it but asking someone to quit meat immediately is like asking a meth addict to quit cold turkey it won t work and it will disconnect u from them the problem i find with most people is that they truly have no exposure to vegan meal or ideology that s why so many people think food is only a meal if it ha meat and why they think that vegan are hippy supporting a gradual change will at very least introduce new option for meal leading to le death and at best will make the future change much easier maybe most of you agree and it s only the most vocal and public activist that support this kind of thinking if so should we change that or maybe i m wrong let me know what you think sorry if this wa an old topic i couldn t find a recent one

0,any musician in here have you noticed any change while on a vegan diet i have this post is a bit odd for this subreddit but i think it s sufficiently on topic first my brief background is that i ve been a musician for about 20 year and i ve been mostly vegan for about 2 month lifestyle change take work and time so please forgive me for the mostly qualifier i m sure you all understand anyhow i immediately within a day or two started noticing measurable and subjective improvement in my health my resting heart rate ha lowered from 72 to 56 on average holy smoke my wedding ring is also looser and that brings me to the subjective part it s fairly well known that a plant based diet lower inflammation throughout the entire body a compared to a for lack of a better term typical american diet but what i didn t expect wa that this would directly transfer to my ability to play my instrument i m a percussionist which is basically a pompous high brow term for drummer badum tschhh when it come to almost any instrument a lot boil down to your technique which determines your energy output and physical stress on soft tissue and joint well in my case my muscle have been able to fly through music and exercise a if i were 10 year younger which wa actually my peak physical condition i get le tired i m le sore and i recover much faster my muscle aren t are swollen after intense playing and i m ready to go in le than half the recovery time it s insane i wanted to share this because it ha boosted my mood beyond anything i ever expected i m finally jazzed about drumming again after a 2 year hiatus due to various reason i didn t think an unrelated lifestyle change would make such a huge impact but it really did also related my wife is also a musician flutist and she ha reported a similar experience i ve been skeptical my whole life about vegan plant based diet lifestyle i really wish i tried this sooner i just feel so much better overall a boost toward getting back into my passion is seriously heart warming too

0,i've been vegan for two month and i wish i could talk about it more i finally took the plunge in february this year ironic since the whole 'februdairy' thing i'm honestly so content with my decision no more feeling guilty after meal and cringing at chicken carcass every sunday i grew up being extremely fussy and pretty much only eating animal product i would heave trying to eat vegetable i knew that i wanted to be vegan and i knew that i wanted to be healthy so i ate more vegetable it wa shit at first but i found one i liked and i got to the point where i could make nutritious and delicious vegan meal i realised that i didn't need animal a a dietary crutch anymore i know it hasn't been long but honestly it's been so amazing for both my physical and mental health i keep having moment where i think to myself 'fuck yeah i'm vegan now ' i come from a family of foodie and i wa always the odd one out eating plain chicken and rice and now i feel like a true foodie along with them i'm more aligned with my moral i feel like i am closer to being a true environmentalist now but how do i talk about this to non vegan i only have one vegan friend and since being switching i have noticed a very strange vibe i haven't been met with all of the 'how do you get your protein ' nonsense just yet i've had a bit of banter thrown at me for being awkward to buy for and having 'vegan rage' i had a brief rant about uk tax subsidy to a work colleague i haven't been met with animosity but there is this strange awkwardness it's almost a if people avoid the topic altogether i genuinely thought that people would want to talk about it more but despite a rise in popularity i've realised that veganism is still strangely taboo i don't want to be the one to sit at the dinner table talking about cow pu and chicken menstruate i always wanted to be the 'lead by example' type a that's how i became vegan seeing others live happily and healthily doing so i just didn't realise how profound this change would be for me and i want to talk about it without feeling like i'm making thing awkward i dunno i'm sure many of you would say that it's important to have awkward conversation for progress to happen and i agree with you i just don't know how to get the party started amp x200b tldr i'm a new vegan loving life but i'm scared to spread the good word because people still seem freaked out by veganism 
0,what's the game plan i've been considering going vegan and i eat le and le meat every day i'm down to 6 meal per week with meat egg chicken but my curiosity relates to the relationship between animal and money on the basis of food and clothing food so when the world ha stopped eating meat what happens to all the pig cow chicken turkey etc are they just slaughtered by the million a factory farm owner see they're no longer profitable is there at all talk of reintroducing cattle to the plain and just letting them roam free don't these specie after so many generation of domestication and purposeful breeding now rely on captivity are there any plan to monetize the small scale domestication of animal for purpose other than meat what are they clothing pertaining to sheep alpaca etc where do we draw the line on clothing a far a i know there's a lot of overlap between vegan and anti climate change pollution community wool ha special property like maintaining heat retention property even when wet in an ever trying climate with harsher extreme we may need this more than ever do we keep using sheep for their wool alpaca the replacement are often plastic based and i don't know which is worse similar argument often arise concerning climate change when we can make money at it is when it will be taken seriously or something along those line countless animal are displaced due to construction pollution and more and there's currently no good way to make money out of helping these animal overgeneralization and please correct me in dm if that's wrong but please hear me out we primarily use nonprofit for that right is there yet a way to make money helping these animal we can advertise something i've missed you can keep your business idea i'll work for friggin' minimal wage to save the animal and the world any source discussion advice comment or anything is welcome below thanks for reading tldr how do we transition from an omnivorous society to vegan society while keeping animal around do we

0,a question hello so i've been transitioning to a more plant based lifestyle i used to identify myself a vegan but i felt it wa inappropriate and did not want to spread misinformation about the movement this is due to me disagreeing with a fundamental core to veganism namely the reduction of animal suffering by any practical mean i do not view animal exploitation a inherently evil i believe it must depend on the circumstance almost all form of animal agriculture today are cruel and i accept that leading me to adjust my lifestyle to avoid a much contribution to the industry a i can however my disagreement lie in the fact that science is leading to more and more way where we can use animal product in sustainabe economical and le cruel way i will use the popular example of lab grown meat we are moving past the need for fbs and the method are getting more and more productive i read in an article the projection is we can create 20 000 pound of beef from a cell collection the implication of this are monumental we could get to the point where we only need a small donor herd per region the small size of this population will imensly reduce greenhouse gas and will be easier to maintain these animal and provide them with an optimum quality of life the only downside is being a relatively painless biopsy amp x200b i suppose the crux of what i'm saying is that i think the exploitation of animal product can be done in an ethical way if certain parameter are met amp x200b this lead me to my question is this dissertation at odds with veganism i greatly welcome criticism comment or question 
0,just because i m vegan doesn t mean i m malnourished or have an eating disorder i feel like a lot of non vegan people are quick to assume that most vegan are malnourished and unhealthy based off of what i see on social medium there is a total crisis with people telling others what they should and shouldn t be eating it s very problematic and tone deaf most of the vegan i know are anything but being malnourished just because you re plant based also doesn t mean you don t eat enough protein non vegan love to tell vegan what they re not eating enough of like they aren t iron and vitamin deficient it really frustrates me because i think most of it stem from stigma and other people own insecurity about what they eat i figured i d put this on the vegan reddit because i don t think i m the only one who experience these thing 
0,seaspiracy a film by a vegan that sends a bad message i wa watching seaspiracy and loving the exposure to the fishing industry and we need these in the medium to open the eye of those who are not aware of the impact animal farming of any specie can have but i have a major flaw i think need to be addressed the movie doe well to expose the financial interest of organisation such a dolphin safe and msc is actually because they are funded by fisher however the film maker is a long term vegan and made a vegan documentary before and even helped with cowspiracy now that in itself isn't a problem it is great but it mean i don't believe the aim of the journey so by him saying he didn't set off to make a documentary that show the impact of eating fish seems untrue maybe he did only want to make a film about plastic but i would believe it more knowing he is a vegan filmmaker if he wa honest that it wa to show the impact of commercial fishing i just feel anyone who look into him could think ah it more vegan propaganda by a vegan to guilt me into being vegan i like my message of promoting veganism to be honest and fair otherwise it can be called out and this is in my opinion the issue with this film what are your thought also i didn't like that it just told the audience to stop eating marine fish which doesn't include freshwater fish let alone other animal

0,we need to talk about veganism and first nation people there's a sentiment going around that veganism is anti indigenous any first nation people in this sub that can clear the air on this sentiment been noticing some post from my omni friend on instagram one suggesting that veganism is a anti indigenous a the meat and dairy industry another firm of colonialism i can't stop thinking about this post because it bother me to no end wa the intent of the post to deter people specifically white people from going vegan wa it meant to make vegan feel guilty somehow wa it meant to address the fact that indigenous people rely on a connection to the land which mean they subsist off meat and we somehow are against that correct me if i'm wrong but i haven't seen a single post here or anywhere for that matter singling out first nation people asking them specifically to go vegan so what's going on here thought

0,my journey being vegan and my thought about it hey guy i want to share how my lifestyle changed going vegan and how it gave me a new perspective about what we're eating and the overall picture with the current food chain i also want to know what you're going to think about my perspective since i have in some way different view for which i will get maybe downvoted but just hear me out when i started college i started living on my own which meant that i had to cook for myself which i never did before moving out i wanted to start experimenting a little with what i eat and my friend told me he wa a netflix documentary the game changer which i decided to give a try and try to avoid animal and dairy product on my plate it started slowly but i stopped buying meat then slowly getting rid of egg cheese switched to plant based milk with this change my teenage acne is 98 gone which wa bad when i wa in high school energy level really boosted i don't feel heavy when i finish my meal even if i fill myself completely discovered so many way of cooking and recipe after seeing this change i wa reading more about how animal agriculture work and it wa such an eye opener how messed up the whole industry work and how i wa uneducated about where doe the food come from what doe it contain how much nutrition it ha what's good and what's not how many animal are killed coming from an eastern europe where meat is basically on a plate every second day it wa quite a change my family is still in confusion why the 'drastic' change but i won't be coming back to the eating habit because with the information i gained living in ignorance or unawareness about how my action impact animal the planet wa on one hand blissful because let's face it everybody love cheese meat but it's not right at the expense of others not in this era when we have so many substitute and option to choose from and with the climate crisis but here's my second thought about it if the animal industry and dairy industry operated in a more sustainable moral way i would support it i grow up in a village my grandma had her own chicken whose egg were incomparable with the one available in supermarket we also got a homemade cheese from one of her friend who got their own cow my belief is that if dairy animal product were consumed once a month or just on special occasion and didn't take it for granted we could reduce the suffering global warming in a great way right now in college i am fully vegan i read carefully what's on the label of the product i buy making sure no animal ingredient are in them however when i come home for a few week i have to cheat because i am not the one cooking and my family always put some milk dairy into the food but i won't touch any meat they prepare i can see that i made some positive impact on my family and friend a well they started eating oat in the morning tofu soya chunk but they are not willing to transform their eating habit completely if you read this all the way through let me know your thought please 
0,please watch seaspiracy you re not just jumping on the bandwagon when you watch this or documentary like this and decide to make a change the whole idea of this is exposure so that we do make change see a lot of people joking that people watch this one documentary and think they know everything so make a rash decision based on one film this guy blew the lid off this conspiracy and hopefully ha caught a lot of people s attention enough for more of u to make the change because it s a change that is 100 worth making also a lot of people myself included tend to avoid these documentary because of how raw and sad they are i am an hsp empath and i cannot bare to witness this stuff but i told myself to just do it for the cause the pain i experienced watching these documentary is absolutely fuck all to what these breath taking being experience i mean if you really can t handle it i totally understand that because it s horrifying but if you can find it in yourself to try and watch this or any documentary regarding this issue and issue alike try i cried my eye out several time the section where they filmed in denmark i wa inconsolable but the information in this documentary wa something we should all be aware of because it is staggering maybe if there s a way for someone to summarise all the fact of the documentary without having to witness the pain and torture of these being and make a post about it i think that might be a great idea i m happy to take a crack at it if anyone would prefer that anyway peace and love to you all

0,anyone else getting extremely annoyed by tiktok a someone who ha been deeply involved in veganism although primarily for animal welfare but morenow for environmental sustainability and humanitarian reason i think it is workt acknowledging how biased tiktok is against vegan now not to say that veganism a an ideology is not worth criticism but i keep getting video recommended popping up in my fy page that play semantic game about veganism imagine if i said for example everyone should donate to charity one would naturally assume that i am not including homeless and low income people to assume or argue that this wa the implication would clearly be a disingenuous assumption but these are the same equivalence made about veganism on tiktok people are constantly implying that veganism is somehow colonialism trying to argue from a perspective of race that vegan are trying to use imperialist ideology to domineer oppressed culture which i know that getting sustainable food is important and trying to buy food which wa acquired using laborer who aren't abused financially is of course important to vegan most of u are deeply concerned not only about animal right but about human right a well veganism a an ideology is altruistic in it essence it really boggles me how people can argue that all we eat are quinoa and avocado something that is very clearly exaggerated to seem a though we enjoy exploiting those in developing nation and their labour but then ignore how their diet doe the same most of the crop imported to and grown in the western world are used for the sake of the animal agricultural industry this exploit the labour of the worker carnists use these argument a if they themselves don't also consume the same product we do what anger me even more is they argue for example that veganism is somehow racist to indigenous people and then ignore the destruction of the amazon for animal agriculture which is home to hundred of indigenous tribe or how about the fishing industry which ha fought tooth and nail especially in canada against the fishing right of indigenous people which in turn cause food insecurity not a peep but they use their politics to try and instill an ideology that is based in false equivalencies wanna talk about discriminating towards people of low income how about chicken farmer in the state who live at or below the poverty line because of industry abuse or maybe we should see low income community like those in north carolina who are predominantly black native american and latino who live near cafos and are dying of disease such a cancer caused by pollution from animal waste or how about the fact that the last 10 global pandemic have been caused by the animal food industry which have disproportionate health outcome for the people in the most empoverished community or how about the fact that most of the world's lowest paying job are those of fast food worker how about the fact that the animal agricultural industry is one one the highest source of green house gas emission in global warming which will harm the world most vulnerable community a the global temperature continue to rise anyone wanna mention any of that yet somehow veganism is exploitative and classist the fact alone that we have enough food on the planet to end world hunger yet most of the world's crop go are used to feed livestock which go to feed the world richest nation is horrifying this is somehow a reality we're all accustomed to and have collectively decided is ok somehow veganism is the problem now a i mentioned earlier problem in vegan food sourcing like any other diet are worth dicussing like migrant worker yielding crop at what is essentially slave labour is horrifying but this is not an issue caused by veganism nor will it be solved by attacking veganism if there were no vegan this would still be an issue a news flash carnists also eat vegetable i am sick of the semantic game and i am sick of the accusation why are these issue only raised when the subject of veganism is brought up i don't see these carnists advocating against exploitation until it suit their bias can we all agree that it is getting ridiculous sorry this wa so long but omfg 
0,what do you think of eating animal that die of natural cause disclaimer i'm not vegan btw so i'll probably get downvoted to oblivion would you eat something that died of age or a non transmittable disease or an accident not intentionally caused something that experienced no intentional suffering or cruelty in it's life here's an example you get a pet chicken and you name her cluckerina every day you feed her help her play with her love her you love her and she love you eventually after 10 year of having a great life cluckerina dy peacefully would it be ethical to eat her she wasn't suffering in life

0,which aspect of veganism wa easier to adopt than you thought and which wa harder i'll start easier not craving meat and dairy finding vegan restaurant in my area finding vegan meat and dairy substitute honestly when i tried to adopt plant based diet couple year ago i failed due to craving but something's changed when i went for veganism instead and craving are no longer a problem harder finding sustainably packaged vegan substitute for meat and dairy finding sustainably packaged vegan cosmetic tbh i thought that vegan in general and vegan targeting company care more about the environment but they choose plastic almost all the time i know enough about the reality of recykling to avoid plastic package at all cost so it mean i am almost never eating product that are not fruit vegatables legume and grain

0,shameless plug for vegan meal kit service + idea for trying new recipe i just wanted to put this out there for anyone who might be struggling to find new vegan recipe or healthier recipe or whatever meal kit are a great option basically the idea behind meal kit is you get the ingredient for a certain number of meal on average three per week sent to you with a recipe card and you make them they're marketed towards people who don't have much time to grocery shop and cook or who eat a lot of fast food i personally keep the recipe card in a binder so that i can make the one i liked again there are company that offer vegan option and also one company purple carrot that is entirely vegan the only downside is price tag 7 10 per portion is quite a bit so it's definitely a luxury for me and i don't order every week ha anyone else tried these or have similar way to try out new vegan dish that don't involve a separate trip to the grocery store and ton of leftover ingredient i would love to do it more but it's time consuming and spending 10 for a particular spice that i'm never going to use for anything else again is a bit steep 
0,some of the people here make me dislike the vegan community that i m so newly a part of i m becoming vegan i m really enjoying it i want to be a part of a vegan community but the more i post question on here the le i want it i posted an honest question earlier that is now deleted not by me i wa respectful i even agreed with the first person who actually commented something helpful and convincing i took the high road every time some people were being rude others just disliked everything i said i rarely admit when i m wrong in internet debate but i did it on this short lasting post i m sure this post will get deleted maybe they ll ban me from the sub or maybe a bunch of people will just reply with more hate and dislike this make me feel excluded from a community i spent so long unsure if i should join it s like my suspicion were being confirmed i agree with you guy and i just had one question i didn t even have an opinion on the question it wa straight up just a question some had an issue that everyone asks it but that doesn t mean it s invalid a lot of people ask if human came from monkey why are their still monkey if every scientist just disliked their question the world wouldn t get any more knowledgeable on the subject so many people were unwilling to answer it and just hated me if you can t even debate someone on your own side how can you debate someone against you and if you can t how are you going to spread the word of veganism and make the world a better place so go on dislike it or ban me but if you want to make the world a better place this isn t how you do it

0,i've been vegan for one month now and thing are going well the biggest struggle is figuring out how to vary my meal i eat oatmeal and a banana every morning spinach and black bean wrap for lunch and either tofu rice brocoli or quinoa brocoli for dinner sometimes pasta i tried tempeh and wasn't a huge fan but i really need to figure out some more meal to fit in any suggestion i'm open to try new thing another concern of mine is the consumption of soy i'm male and although the estrogen thing seems to be nonsense i have heard that high level of soy could lead to infertility and since i'd like to have kid someday i dont want to overdo it until i can do more research but dang i'd eat tofu everyday otherwise i haven't told anyone really yet my mom know and my brother know now but i just don't like attention and i'm scared of people making comment to me and i just don't want to deal with it quite yet shoe were a unexpected curveball i really needed new shoe and my mom surprised me by getting me some which wa nice of her but i had to be sure they were vegan information wa hard to find but i ended up calling sketcher customer service and gave them the item number they confirmed that the shoe are vegan yay i need skate shoe a well so hopefully i can find some vegan skate brand soon i watched dominion after becoming vegan and it just solidified my choice i couldn't watch more than 10 minute of it without cry horribly i can't imagine anyone can watch this and think yeah this is ok i'll just keep getting animal product but i know some do i still haven't finished it but i can only take it bit by bit the thought of eating animal product just make me sick at this point i'll keep going no turning back

0,the sneaky vegan hear me out my best friend is the best vegan i have ever met she is a vegan because that is what she morally belief is right but she ha never once tried to make me eat vegan even when i'm with her i've had friend before that were vegan and whenever we're together they expect me to eat vegan and i do not give them a hard time about that because i understand that is their moral stance when we're making pancake together she make hers vegan and she's like oh i almost forgot you're not vegan and you prefer it with egg and she make mine with egg so i'm not kidding the most respectful vegan i have ever met we have been friend for 5 year that being said she ha shown me some really yummy vegan food company that have microwave meal that are delicious that i just actually like and when i'm with her sometimes i choose to eat vegan with her and she's shown me some really good recipe she's also british so her family ha forced me to love tea and we were talking about tea and she's like well i make it this way with almond milk but of course you'll probably be using regular milk so just use this much to make it just the way you like it at my house and i wa like oh my gosh you know what i think the tea would probably taste really good with almond milk instead of my dairy milk i should definitely use almond milk because it's also really good in and i listed a few other recipe that i use it in although i don't like drinking almond milk or using it in cereal then suddenly i realized and i called her on it i'm like you are sneakily making me vegan you are playing the long game and i respect that you respect the fact that i'm not vegan so much that i feel the need to respect the fact that you're vegan more than i normally would and you're showing me how yummy it can be how dare you i'm going to go drink my vegan tea with my vegan pancake

0,disillusioned with speciesist leftist random musing honestly i feel like for many leftist being anti oppression is more about identity and performance than anything else basically it feel good to project an image of being a radical and to receive validation from others it reassures our moral self understanding it help our social life it let u connect with others in our tribe it doesn't take much effort for a white person to share a blm article or even attend a rally it doesn't make much effort for a man to talk about women's right there's cultural support for these stance it doesn't take real conviction to get on board one the other hand here we have this gargantuan atrocity billion of sentient being systematically tortured and killed they are being gassed and castrated and electrocuted all so we can literally eat their body for pleasure three day old infant literally have their nut sliced out screaming and their dead body are sold anyone who think about it honestly for even 5 minute know it's pure evil it's not even kind of bad it's at the level of the worst crime in history but most non vegan leftist don't care enough to go vegan or even to do the bare as minimum of raising awareness why because there isn't much of a personal pay off in being anti speciesist you have to change your behavior concretely not just say the right thing you have to accept that you've been doing something wrong your whole life and you have to go against the majority there are real tangible change required of being a proponent of animal liberation which you don't find with other cause there's no bullshitting possible you have to walk the walk the fact that most leftist willfully ignore something so patently horrendous ha made me more and more cynical i don't think most people truly reason out why they believe what they do if people had a deeper understanding of why racism or sexism are wrong philosophically they'd be much more receptive to argument against speciesism but most of the time i believe many people just instinctively conform to the norm they don't reason themselves into core belief but just absorb them from others heidegger ha this concept of da man the they which basically refers to an impersonal social reality or background of thought he say that we tend to live inauthentically and just live passively accept the value of the they because that is what one doe i don't think i'm somehow about living inauthentically no one is and i don't blame non vegan who honestly are ignorant we were all their once but pretty much everyone at this point know that animal are tortured and killed for food it's willful ignorance more anything else people choose to look away simply because they get some minor benefit and because they aren't made to feel like a bad person by society

0,try this out sometime so i have very recently discovered a way to get people to start on the path to veganism when they say they could never do it actually agree let them know you have to be very disciplined and take most matter into your own hand and research how to obtain the protien they will need do not tell them this is by any mean easy to find they will be proud because they will think they discovered a secret that give them a step above tell them they couldn't last 5 day let alone 14 day they will try it and they will succeed they will also discover their distaste for certain animal product and even it they do crave them their digestive system will throw them a big middle finger

0,donated blood a a vegan of almost 4 year and my hemoglobin level wa good the blood bank worker said the low level is 13 and the high is 20 and my number wa 15 about a week before donating i had been eating a serving or two of quaker oat cereal which ha 80 90 of the iron rda added a a supplement along with a few mandarin orange before and after to boost vitamin c level which help iron uptake but before that cereal i had essentially done nothing special concerning iron since i became vegan in june 2017 the fact that iron absorption is coupled so closely with your blood vitamin c level is i think a key indicator of just how fundamentally important it is to be eating a wide range of plant food there is no vitamin c in traditional american meat product the inuit use raw seal brain for vitamin c sometimes so there's that anyways i just wanted to share my blood donation story because i wa pretty happy when he said my iron level wa good and then i dropped the vegan bomb on him and he wa like w what do you eat no meat no dairy a if he couldn't believe i could have that good an iron level haha

0,doe anyone else ever find veganism emotionally exhausting a rant it hard to describe exactly what i mean i guess just my own awareness and choice to be aware in addition to being a part of the community and all that this brings with it for example i wa scrolling through reddit before bed last night and i happened upon an extremely triggering image of animal abuse untagged in my front page while i understand that this wa not done a a prank or something but rather to spread awareness and while there were comment suggesting it may be fake or out of context this image wa extremely graphic and immediately sent me into a panic attack because it wa so sudden and unexpected i then spent the next few hour trying desperately to calm myself down because while a panic attack itself doesn't last super long the after effect do this is just one specific and severe example but i just feel like the constant discussion of animal abuse chip away at me mentally and emotionally i make me feel burnt out and it make me dread interacting with others i feel a though i don't have any friend anyways and especially not vegan one so i feel extremely isolated i also just dread having discussion about it with my family because the people around me are the kind of people who literally will never get it we are talking narcissistic family member i feel like my home life play into a lot of my mental state but i feel like a well that i get burnt out easily from everything especially because everything feel so fucked up and horrible it feed into my anxiety and depression and while i watch everyone boast about how their mental state is only improving i feel like in a way mine is deteriorating it a big reason why i haven't watched dominion yet i feel concerned that i'm in such a terrible headspace that it will only cause a more serious issue i want to stress that i don't think that eating vegan or refusing to consume animal product is causing this i truly believe that my awareness is just another layer of the amount of shit that's gone wrong that i see every day doe anyone else feel like this 
0,ethic of adopting a mouse bred for snake food i posed this question in r debateavegan but it is a time sensitive issue currently awaiting moderator approval warning this post contains description of animal death tldr someone's pet snake died before he could feed the snake a mouse now he doesn't know what to do with the mouse if it becomes inevitable that he get another snake would it be preferable to rescue the little fella or to allow him to become the new snake's meal in place of a poor future mouse whose sale would benefit a scumbag rodent breeder full post i will first mention that i am a vegan of seven year and personally averse to rescuing obligate carnivore a long a human are unable to supplant their diet with adequate alternative to animal meat on a consistent basis until lab cultured option are available relying on roadkill or meat from animal culled by legal mandate leaf too much suffering to chance and i would like to provide a little consumer demand a possible to industry that exploit animal i have an uncomfortable scenario at hand until recently someone i know would feed mouse to a snake he kept a a pet he kept one mouse at a time between feeding before the most recently purchased mouse could be delivered a a meal the snake passed away the former snake owner life about 1000 mile away from me and doe not want the mouse he accepted my instinctive offer to find someone to adopt him unfortunately he plan to adopt another snake to whom he will almost certainly feed mouse on one hand i could save this mouse and feel good about having kept one innocent animal from being killed on the other hand i would probably only be swapping the life of this mouse for that of another one the human would buy from a rodent breeder which would profit the mouse seller and create demand for his business should i save one mouse now at the expense of another later or do i let him become food for the next snake in order to both save a future mouse from such a fate and avoid creating an incentive for this person to support the breeder in the future please pardon the jumble this is keeping me up and my heart and my brain are at odds i would appreciate some opinion on this one

0,feeling down and frustrated need to vent so the other day my husband and i were driving home after he got his second dose of the vaccine we currently live on the big island of hawaii and had just spent a wonderful day exploring since the place that did his shot wa almost 2 hour away on the other side of the island we tried a trendy vegetarian restaurant that put honey mustard on the salad that we were going to share even though we specifically requested that it be made vegan and they assured u that that wouldn't be a problem i didn't want to contribute more to the food waste problem though so my husband who is not vegan decided that he would eat the salad i decided not to let that get me down though and just enjoyed the rest of the food we ordered which wa all very good later we drove around a bit looking at some of the local shop and sight including a gorgeous waterfall and then we headed home by the time we got back to our side of the island my husband wa feeling hungry again so he suggested that we pick up some food at panda express which is not certified vegan due to cross contamination i know but doe have the eggplant tofu and chow mein which are made with plant based recipe so i'm personally okay with eating there a we approach the restaurant though my husband who normally pay get a call from his mom and asks me to go get the food so he can take the call without thinking i say sure what do you want and i'm immediately overcome with dread because i realize that he's going to ask me to get him the teriyaki chicken and walnut shrimp and then i start having a panic attack my husband who picked up the call before he realized i wa freaking out told his mom that he would call her back later and ended the call quickly he then asked if i wa okay and if we still wanted to get food i told him that i wasn't really hungry and we drove home we ended up skipping dinner altogether and we haven't really talked about what happened i think the reason i started freaking out is because i had always had a degree of separation between his eating habit and my responsibility for them but when he asked me to pick up and thus pay for his food it wa like i would be accepting personal responsibility for it and while i don't believe that his choice are wholly my responsibility i'm concerned that i haven't done enough to try to convince him to change and i feel like i've been selfishly avoiding that conversation with him because it will be awkward and uncomfortable anyway i'm just feeling really down about it and i could use some advice or encouraging story from those of you who may have had similar issue with your spouse or other loved one

0,when my animal die i want to leave their body in the plateau to be eaten by the wolf i want to create a farmed animal sanctuary in my ancestral homeland which is an isolated mountainous region with a wild plateau inhabited by wolf i wa wondering what to do with the animal body after they died when it dawned on me we will all hold a funeral ritual for them and take their deceased body into the wild plateau where it will be eaten by the wolf this way i will be honoring the dead animal the wolf and nature all at once imagine despite our vet s effort bolota s body wa too old and too damaged by selective breeding and he ended up dying so we all got together held a funeral and took his body in a procession into the wild plateau where we left it to be eaten by the wolf i like this idea so much that now i kinda wish that wa the custom for human too because now i would like my funeral to be like that returning to nature to the circle of life the iberian wolf are an endangered specie who wa saved from extinction in my country and now roam the pleateau of my ancestral land 
0,alienated from my family warning long post rant i ve been vegan for almost 3 year my family mom sister and brother in law were supportive at first but basically in the sense that they thought i had found a new hobby a time ha gone on i have tried to talk to them about the reality of animal agriculture and the immense suffering they all call themselves animal lover btw i ve shared article and video etc and now it s to the point where they ignore me i don t feel like i have bombarded them with information i will share something once a month or so but about 6 week ago i shared an article about pig farming via group text and my sister hasn t contacted me since even though i ve reached out to her several time since then about completely unrelated benign topic last week mom agreed to watch dominion with me before we started it she went on and on for about 15 minute about a stray cat she had taken to an animal shelter recently and about how she wa appalled that the shelter released the cat back into the neighborhood several day later in 20 degree weather to fend for himself because they said the cat most likely belonged to someone in the neighborhood and in their experience this wa the best way for the cat to make his way back home this horrified me too that an animal shelter would deal with an animal this way but that s not my point my point is that after this discussion about the cat and how disgusted she wa with their handling of the cat my mom and i proceeded to watch dominion she didn t bat an eye she wasn t bothered or disturbed at all by the sheer terror and fear that wa evident in the animal eye and face and the horrible suffering that way shown she actually started to doze off in the middle of it but i woke her up i ll bet if i were to ask her right now what she learned about the dairy industry from that film she wouldn t be able to tell me anything she told me before we watched it that it wasn t going to change her mind i asked her to just please watch and listen with an open mind and be willing to learn something i think she just tuned it out and didn t listen to any of the narrative and assumed that the footage she wa seeing wa from isolated case not the norm i love my family but i m having an extremely hard time dealing with the hypocrisy and the blatant unwillingness to learn how their food end up on their plate it s definitely causing a rift but i don t know how to be ok with it i tell them what i have learned and they just don t care if it were about any other topic or injustice they would be receptive they just literally refuse to discus this with me or learn anything i can t stand it it s like if you know me and love me and are close to me then be open to what i m trying to share with you and show you about what i ve learned about the horror of animal agriculture i feel like they would rather cling to their right to eat animal product than to take me seriously this doesn t make me want to stay in contact with them we were so close before why won t they trust that maybe what i m trying to share with them is real if i ve learned something that upset me extremely why won t they take me seriously and consider that there might be something to what i m saying i feel like they d literally rather keep their head buried in the sand and eat animal product than have a relationship with me

0,vegan for the animal growing up in a first generation middle eastern family meat and dairy product were a huge part of our upbringing about four year ago one of our family member wa diagnosed with an illness instead of resorting to incorporating the prescribed medication for a lifetime we decided to go vegan a a family to help support the transition to heal with food a opposed to medication within the first few month contrary to the medical advice received at the time all sign of the illness disappeared and our family fully adopted the vegan lifestyle for health purpose ever since a the year went by many other aspect of our life changed naturally we began to become more aware of the product we were using and their impact on our body a well a the environment but one of the biggest impact adopting a vegan lifestyle ha had for me personally wa the dissolution of the concept that we a a specie are superior to others driving home on the highway the other afternoon a duck wa sitting on the asphalt road just about a foot away from the median a car drove by the driver would move over and continue their journey the highway wa two lane one way with a 50 mph speed limit there wa a man made river with a pond about a quarter mile away where the duck spend their time i pulled over to see if i could help take her to safety i approached the duck and put my hand out to let her know i wa there to help one of her foot sticking out but i couldn t see any other sign of injury she let me pick her up without any fear i carried her to the pond and placed her beside the water to let her decide whether she wanted to swim or rest i sat down next to her and spent about 20 minute by her side until her eye started to relax and her head slowly doze off a i began to realize what wa happening i sang her a song about the graceful life she must have lived at the pond i sang until she passed and immediately broke down in tear i found so much relief in knowing this small act of compassion allowed her to spend the remainder of her time at home beside the lake under the shade and in the company of her family a opposed to a hot asphalt road with massive machine roaring by her every moment until her last moment being vegan ha had many positive impact on my life but more than anything i am grateful for having been gifted the clarity to understand the vast amount of similarity we share with all other form of life to embrace the connection to our planet it landscape and all of it inhabitant we are all one and the same and i will forever be vegan for the animal

0,sorry forgot you were vegan i hear this a lot from non vegan friend and family now it's of course no one's job to recall this fact about me i'm not that important ala i can use my word to inform people who need to know but having to remind the same people over and over again is annoying and sometimes invalidating if my friend or family member were allergic to nut they would not have to tell me twice and i would not subject them to nut if they were undergoing a spiritual fast i would avoid talking about and eating food around them given the uncontested importance of such thing it seems only decent but again not obligatory to know these thing it doesn't take up that much mental real estate sometimes when non vegan people who know me fairly well say this to me it sound awfully disingenuous a disingenuous a it would sound to them if i said to them say sorry i forgot you ate meat by the way the same people tend to feel annoyed when you tell them you're vegan a if remembering that fact wouldn't circumvent that i'm speculating here but sometimes i can't help but think the aim is delegitimize a lifestyle commitment by deeming it utterly forgettable then again some people just have bad memory in which case fair enough it's not all about you a they say

0,i think i m done with impossible meat i went vegan about 3 year ago just in time for the meat substitute craze in the southern u anyway at first i wa so grateful that i could eat something that reminded me of meat but wa made from plant overall it really helped me with the transition from meat eater to vegan however this is the second time it ha made me sick i have acid reflux issue so it wouldn t surprise me in the slightest if the fat content wa the culprit impossible meat ha never been part of my regular diet because it s not healthy like at all the high protein content no cholesterol claim are about the only thing going for it it s the perfect substitute for the classic american diet because there are 14 gram of fat per 4oz it feel heavy on your stomach and is very filling plus it taste like meat cook like meat etc i ate it last night and i ate too much of it so i woke up at 5am with nausea stomach pain amp heartburn i ve eaten it dozen of time over the last 3 year and it s only made me sick twice but i think that s enough for me to swear off it for now it is certainly better than murdering an innocent cow but it is not necessarily better for your health plant nourish our body so much better than substitute so please be careful with them my friend feel free to share your experience with meat substitute good or bad

0,is there a reason why earthling doesn't cover the dairy or egg industry in any detail so i rewatched earthling today and of course it wa horrible terrible cried numerous time some of the image are still burned into my mind like the men jumping up and down on the chicken and the fox still being alive after being skinned something i hadn't realised though is that the documentary ha almost nothing to say about dairy and egg at all the only small mention about dairy is that the dairy cow are kept chained up all day long in factory farm nothing about the constant raping the separation of baby and mother the resulting bellowing from the mother and the killing of the calf the only thing about hen that is mentioned is that they live their life in battery cage nothing about the chick culling this is one of the most important thing about why egg production is horrific i definitely do feel like this documentary is the best out there on animal right not just veganism i think the narration is much more powerful than that of dominion but on reflection i feel like it advocate vegetarianism more than veganism

0,how our society relates to other animal is actually psychopathic i'm not saying people are innate psychopath but the the ideology instilled in people lead to a psychopathic disposition toward other animal basically psychopath don't recognize that others are actually autonomous others with their own life and interest they can't imagine that others have perspective or if they do they assign no inherent value to those perspective when people see a pig screaming in pain most don't seem to understand that the pig ha an embodied existence and that the scream is communicating stop this unbearable leave me alone they might say i believe in humane slaughter or whatever but they still will eat bacon which show they don't understand the gravity of what they are seeing they see the pig a an it a some type of organic machine without thought screaming by blind reflex the pain is abstract and unreal to them they don't grasp that a subject with a mind is before them when people say eating bacon is a personal choice what they are actually saying is other animal are thing with no value and i can do what i want to them the existence of the nonhuman animal a an other doesn't even register with them they are not innately psychopathic but they speciesism engrained in them lead to psychopathic attitude toward other animal at the level of society it's a kind of cultural psychopathy

0,the future is here lab grown dairy i just learned about this from someone i follow on instagram haven't seen anything about it here but i must spread the word so there's this company called perfect day food that literally have developed vegan whey warning i am not a biochemis so they took the dna of whey protein from an open source database fed it to a type of bacteria the bacteria us that a it blueprint for what it's going to be when it grows up they ferment it and the end product is chemically identical to whey protein from a cow longer description on their website here http perfectdayfoods com process they literally still even need to write contains dairy on the package even though it is vegan so they're selling this product to food manufacturer and it look like there are three ice cream brand on the market that use the ingredient soon it look like there will be yogurt and cheese which i am so pumped for honestly this feel super revolutionary lab grown meat ha always felt super hypothetical but now it look like it might happen in the next 5 10 year and it feel like dairy is even a bigger accomplishment because people struggle the most to give it up do you guy think this lab grown alternative could eventually be cheaper than cow made dairy too since it seems like it take way le resource are you going to try it do you think it could make a long term vegan sick

0,a couple question i will start by saying i m not a vegan but i have a couple friend who are and i m genuinely curious 1 why are you vegan i know this is probably the most asked question of any of them but i m more wondering if there s one specific reason or if your decision is based on a multitude of different factor 2 how much did your life change when you decided to go vegan are there thing you miss and do you have any specific way of dealing with that 3 there s a lot of activism that surround veganism ranging from animal right to climate change do activism and veganism inherently go hand in hand or would you consider that a coincidence of multiple movement with similar goal 4 finally how do you perceive people who aren t vegan do you believe there is a moral high ground or are you indifferent answer one answer none i d just like to know what y all think 
0,ha anyone else noticed that people love to tell others that you're vegan it's so funny because the stereotype is that vegan love to tell other people that they're vegan but i'm often reluctant to because people usually take it badly and want to have bad faith conversation with me about it but my non vegan friend and family seem eager to tell other people that i'm vegan whenever the conversation turn to something semi related it make me kind of uncomfortable tbh because i feel like i'm being singled out othered in some way not like they have bad intent exactly but more that they're seeking validation in not being vegan from other omnis

0,human are more important than animal because we have more rationality and we have the ability to understand higher concept like morality this is why we can slaughter and experiment on billion of animal every year guiltlessly imagine trying to use the argument the fact that we have a concept of morality mean we are allowed to perform cruelty on an unimaginably vast scale unironically amp x200b p s it's not even true that animal aren't rational or that they have no concept of morality when an elephant try to rescue a baby rhino trapped in mud that elephant clearly ha a concept of morality when a pigeon recognises cat scan of people who have cancer cat scan that even human expert find difficult to discern then clearly they have a form of rationality that surpasses even human being so even if the argument wasn't an embrassingly obvious contradiction it is the argument would still fail and yet it's the most common pro cruelty argument i've seen absurd

1,keto doesn t work for me anymore hey everyone in 10 day it will mark my 6 month anniversary of me starting keto since then i ve learned a lot and tried a lot when i started keto in the first few week like everyone i dropped a decent amount of weight 14 pound and wa very happy then after doing keto for around 2 month and rarely exercising i dropped almost 30 pound total but in the last 4 month i have barley lost any weight 5 pound total i haven t changed anything that i wa doing in the beginning if anything i ve made my diet better but i m still not losing weight i checked if i had ketone in my body today and the thing came back a negative even though i haven t done anything that would be a reason why my body isn t in ketosis my diet nowadays consists of food like almond cheese mixed berry bulletproof coffee stevia half and half egg vegetable chicken and beef i ve done my macro i count calorie i count carbs i don t eat any sugar but i still don t lose weight anymore and i don t know what to do if anyone ha any suggestion on what i can do to lose weight please let me know thanks and have a good day 
1,should i track alcoholic spirit along with all my macro i am one of those impatient 40 somethings who lost a ton of weight on a low carb diet 20 year ago and is not struggling to see significant loss on keto i've been weighing my food and tracking everything i put in my mouth when i track everything i eat and drink i am well within and often 20 under my caloric and carbohydrate goal for my macro however if i drink any alcohol spirit only vodka gin etc that stuff is so calorically dense if i tracked those calorie a well i'd shoot past my caloric goal for the day after a couple of sip now i've heard from multiple resource that ethanol is so taxing on the system to dismantle and digest that it actually requires more calorie to process than it contains i rarely drink alcohol maybe once a week at the most and when i do it it always gin and diet tonic or i sip on scotch and soda so i'm not talking about the calorie in beer or sugary cocktail i am only talking about the huge number of calorie in spirit do you guy count them in with your macro for the day 
1,sucralose yay or nay hi guy first day on keto earlier i had a conversation with a friend and we started talking about the sweetener in my ketoade i'm using a sucralose bulk powder carb amp sugar free sweetener strawberry flavoured the liquiflav drop this person started being very aggressive towards me because i said i'm using sucralose what's wrong with it i know that the powder one have maltodextrine and dextrose a filler but not this one this one is liquid 0 carbs 0 sugar no nasties doe it still raise insulin or what's wrong with it thanks 
1,solve the electrolyte riddle ever since going keto low carb i feel my electrolyte were messed up but i still can't figure out how to properly correct them since you guy are electrolyte expert by default maybe you could figure this out what would you say based on these symptom and reaction to each supplement i've tried to supplement and add food in many different way and nothing seems effective so far overall symptom brain fog effort to breathe only on rare occasion i forget i'm breathing low energy overall threshold crampy leg sodium make me feel just with a little more energy and le lightheaded for a short amount of time taking more won't help much serum is always around the mid lower healthy range potassium instantly kill any anxiety and make my breathing smooth lower cramp the effect are very short lived and reverse into worsening symptom in a pretty short time taking too much irritates stomach increase brain fog and make me dizzy and weak serum is always around the upper healthy range magnesium this is a real riddle magnesium take a while to buildup in the body so it would make a lot of sense to assume i'm depleted after all i haven't been supplementing throughout the lowest carb period but i can't tolerate it at all a little a 260mg 400mg a day will increase sleepiness will make me sleepy the next day even if i take it at night cramp yeah literally a short while after taking my muscle will threaten to cramp at the next contraction diarrhea and brain fog tried most form glycinate malate threonate threonate is the only one that won't give me diarrhea but same side effect serum is on the lower healthy range which could indicate subclinical hypomagnesemia but i can't tolerate it go figure calcium probably have been on a pretty low intake for a long time based on what i eat had a vit d deficiency a while ago but wa corrected through supplement and reached normal level whenever i had a bunch of dairy or calcium rich food i did not feel anything in particular serum is around the upper healthy range 
1,goal achieved i'm a long time lurker to the sub and been watching people left and right hit there goal my journey wasn't a great a most i started off at 217 pound and at 5'7 that would put me in the overweight category i started keto a anew year's resolution for myself and a a bet to my fiancee that i could lose the weight she love me either way but want me to be healthy i took on the path of strict keto and with the help of the advice of many people in this sub i finally made it toy goal weight i am 180 pound now i haven't been this weight since i wa a sophomore in college i am 27 now i never thought i'd shed the weight i did keto once before like 3 year ago but quit because i wa approaching the whole diet incorrectly now for me this isn't a diet this is a lifestyle and i plan to keep on it for a long a i live in reality keto isn't so hard and i am so glad i took the plunge thank you all on this sub and thank you keto 
1,mct oil bottom line up front how much value do you place in mct oil and how can i ensure that i'm getting a quality mct oil if i buy one online about me i'm still relatively new to keto i began the day after thanksgiving last year and have been going great with one 3 day period two week ago where i allowed myself to have carbs before returning to form i have lost 30 lb since thanksgiving 2020 due in part to both keto and if not really exercising much yet however before my brief carb overload i realized i wa plateauing and not really losing much anymore so i started to finally keep track of my nutrient count i mostly just avoided eating anything with carbs testing to ensure i never fell out of ketosis and i realized that there are day when i have trouble getting my fat intake where it should be don't get me wrong for the most part i have been nearly spot on with my macro 60 30 10 without actually focusing on hitting those number for month which i wa surprised by but there are day where it get out of whack usually those are the day where i have chicken breast for dinner a the protein fat ratio throw thing off a bit i decided to finally look into mct oil but a with everything i don't trust any company's claim of being great i've seen far too much bullsh t i usually go to labdoor to check for their rating on supplement but they don't seem to have mct rating so i wanted to come to you to ask about your preferred mct oil just the basic no frill mct oil that you use because i know if i search online for something i'll get 1 000 different product suggestion with at least 50 000 usage of the term keto and 20 000 weight loss on the label and not have any clue which is worthwhile

1,how to unify protein restriction with weight training hello all i often see the recommendation to limit protein intake to a maximum of 25 35 g per meal a this is what the body is able to utilize for muscle synthesis and that excess protein may be unproductive to ketosis a it will convert to glucose and yet a someone attempting to gain muscle mass by bodyweight training while eating two meal a day within an 8 hour window eating only 25 35 g of protein per meal seems sort of silly if no detrimental to progress do you know how high protein or adequate protein for muscle building can be unified with ketogenic eating for maximum benefit in both area 
1,transitioning out of keto hey everyone i don't know if this fit in here too but i have decided to slowly end my keto journey low carb high fat nutrition i did it for 60 day lost around 20lbs and felt quite well but i had very often diarrhea an upset stomach eventhough i wa aware of having good fat a diverse diet and getting my green mineral and vitamin in i learned through this elemination that i cannot digest tomato well and lot more about my body i have decided to slowly transition out of the lchf way of eating into more of a 40 30 30 c f p macro split for several reason do you have any point i should be aware of i will stay at clear goal like keeping processed sugar out only drinking water and not drinking my calorie but i am a bit afraid of messing up with reintroducing carbs into my diet again br and sorry for the grammar english is not my native language

1,keto is the best working diet for me hi im a male that recently turned 30 and end of january i passed 100 kilo back then i ate a shitload of carbs and did little to no sport thanks to corona thats when i found out about keto i started my keto voyage and only made single cheat day every 3 week since then i lost 8 5 kilo in just over 2 5 month i feel a lot more confident and people tell me how my face look slimer and my stomach shrinked english is not my first language so sorry for the bad grammar and choice of word keto rock 
1,why round 3 is different i ll start this off with my first two weight loss journey to give you an idea of where i have been and where i am at now i hope it give someone out there the motivation they need to find the lifestyle that work best for them keto or not my first weight loss journey in 2013 wa based on calorie restriction and cardio i paid no mind to macro since i didn t know what a macro wa i just focused on eating healthy food and made sure i had a big calorie deficit while hitting the gym for 45 minute a day i lost 30 pound in 3 month i wa stuck at 166 pound for about a week before i became so discouraged i gave up i hit a plateau and didn t know how to break it instead of being patient and trying to work through it i went back to my old bad habit my second weight loss journey wa in 2018 i had hit 209 pound on the scale my heaviest ever outside of being 230 pound when i wa 9 month pregnant with my son nope i started a low fat diet that working 2 fairly active full time job and going to the gym helped me shed 47 pound in 4 month my progress went downhill when i switched to 3rd shift at one of my job i wa stuck at 162 pound and didn t have the patience to break through the plateau i didn t give up on myself immediately this time but i lost it over time and ended up gaining all but 5 pound back within the next few year here we are round 3 sitting at 204 pound and struggling to stay awake past 6 30pm every day i knew change had to be made i joined and followed social medium group for the top trending lifestyle keto i read through so many progress post and most people have done so well with it i decided to look into this way of life a little more and read about carb restriction the one thing i haven t yet targeted i then stumbled upon an article about carb sensitivity and the warning sign i will be damned i relate to every single sign that day i discovered that i really need to limit my carbs and i decided that keto is probably best for me personally i started this journey 2 and a half month ago in february and i m already down almost 40 pound this time with minimal exercise and working only one job with this new diet paired with intermittent fasting there is no doubt in my mind that i will finally make it through the 160 s and maybe even reach my ultimate goal of 145 pound a goal that i have repeatedly failed to achieve for 7 year now with the knowledge and experience i have this time around i will succeed only 20 more pound to go the last 20 the hardest 20 
1,why is maltodextrin not a carb maltodextrin ha close to twice the gi a table sugar so in keto term if you were to consume it you would have to pretty much double the carbs from it but no nutritional label seem to include it a a carb take splenda for example the 1 ingredient in it is maltodextrin yet their nutrition label show 0 carbs so i have always wondered why do our nutrition label not consider maltodextrin a carb 
1,suggestion please i'm 3 week into keto and feeling amazing it not only ha helped me lose weight but i'm also saving so much money by not eating out ordering take out however i feel like i'm cooking the same 3 or 4 thing each week and now i'm looking for some recipe suggestion i don't do seafood i'll eat just about any veggie and typically i like chicken ground turkey and a little bit of beef a well i have a three year old who is super picky so i typically make him something separate for his meal i also have a 10 month old who i am doing baby led weaning with he eats what i eat but i do add a form of carbs from him my husband work late and i usually offer him a serving of what i've made for myself but he is picky a well so preferably anything i can make a smaller amount of thanks

1,how do i know when to stop supplementing my electrolyte hello i have always been low carb but am about a month in for a strict keto diet my primary motivation for doing so is to boost my focus in addition to all the other health benefit long story short i quit caffeine and nicotine about a year and a half ago but my focus dropped off a cliff to make up for it i thought i'd try a real keto diet not just low carb and i take some nootropics like lion's mane and l theanine i manage to stay well below 20 net carbs per day and i intermittently fast using the 16 8 method i can happily say that the combination of keto + nootropics ha brought my focus back to the point where i can code i'm a web developer long hour into the night like i used to before i quit all form of caffeine the downside to all this however is that since the first few day on keto i have developed a persistent non stop muscle twitch it is mostly in both my leg thigh knee and calf my foot and occasionally my arm and eyelid none of it is localized it appears to be random and i can always feel it at rest so hundred of time a day all sign and everything i could read up on pointed towards an electrolyte imbalance had a brief few day where i wa certain it wa m or al lol i decided to experiment and started taking a liquis magnesium supplement the twitch subsided big time although not disappear completely to test my hypothesis further after a few week of taking the magnesium supplement i stopped just to see what would happen what happened wa my muscle twitch ramped back up from 10 to 100 and got a bad a they were when i first started keto having said all that and noticing the correlation between the twitch and taking the magnesium supplement and not taking it my question for you fine educated folk is at what point do i stop taking the magnesium i can almost say for a certainty that the difference in twitch is huge between when i'm taking it and not is there any other electrolyte supplement i should be looking out for to help with the twitch a well if these supplement are indeed helping with the twitch and they come back when i'm not taking the supplement is there a point in keto where the electrolyte will balance itself out and the twitching will stop thanks in advance

1,could low protein intake cause exhaustion brain fog and hunger so i've been having this brain fog for a few year now also am always exhausted to some degree the fog lifted for a period of time then came back i'm not sure why and when exactly this is week three of keto and i've been struggling to hit my recommended protein intake also haven't been getting the energy a lot of people do i tried protein shake but they were gross left me with this weird aftertaste today my protein bar arrived and after half of one which would be about 9 gram of protein i felt great quite full but most importantly clearheaded and full of energy i barely feel like this ever in week one i felt like that after a cup of matcha tea it's amazing i've also been feeling hungry quite often lately but due to getting into intermittent fasting first i've kind of embraced that and don't really mind however i feel like this mean i'm doing something wrong do you guy think this mean i'm just nog getting enough protein in and if i would be i'd feel a lot better and fuller overall and i'm guessing i'd need even more if i wanted to work out

1,can blood ketone level give insight on becoming more fat adapted i know many say not to focus on the ketone level and i really don't stress over it i enjoy checking my blood ketone level because i am a nerd and seeing the fluctuation data is just plain interesting to me when i started me ketone level in my blood were pretty high 2 3 3 6 throughout the day i've been tracking and there's been a slight decline and now on my 3rd week i'm more at 1 5 2 3 my diet ha not changed i track that too doe this downward trend show that my body is becoming more efficient at using ketone and can i assume when i have achieved fat adaption at some point i have a form of narcolepsy so i can't judge how i feel by my energy but hoping to see improvement in that with time again not concerned about my level just curious on understanding the data 
1,water weight during pm lady have you seen any change in how you gain water weight since going on keto curious about everyone s experience my water weight gain during pm ha gotten better far le bloated but this ha been an odd week gained 4 lb little worried if it s just pm or if i need to change thing up with my diet it will be hard to tell until i get my period 
1,why do people get surgery to lose weight when they can just go on keto ive been on keto for 4 day so far and i feel amazing and never hungry i didnt get the keto flu or anything right now it is 9am and the last time i ate wa yesterday at 5pm im not hungry whatsoever and i feel like if i ate something rn i would get full in a bite or two i just don t understand how people get surgery to lose weight like the gastric sleeve surgery to make their stomach smaller i am shredding a pound a day and this id by far the easiest diet i have ever tried im more determined than ever to drop 40 pound and i know i will make that happen before the summer i am so pumped 
1,ha keto helped you with binge eating and or balancing hunger hormone i struggle with binge eating disorder and a the title read i wonder what your experience is regarding binge eating and or hunger hormone while eating keto ha it helped or ha it not made a significant difference i m constantly hungry so i seem to have some type of leptin resistance it might just be emotional mental a well but it feel so physical i just wonder if it might help going keto right now i eat paleo ish i eat no refined sugar no dairy except ghee and no gluten but i do eat quite a bit of carbs like rice and gluten free bread 
1,doe anybody else get carb nightmare i ve noticed that ever since i started keto a little over a month ago i ll occasionally have dream where i eat a super carb heavy meal or drink a ton of regular soda and not realize it until a little while later and then start thinking i just blew all my progress then i always wake up and am so relieved i didn t actually eat all those carbs just curious if anybody else had experience like this hahaha 
1,thank you r keto but goodbye i have been following this sub for around 2 year now and it really helped me but for my own good i need to leave reading all those story's about macro and weight loss make me obsessive about my own i cant measure every gram of food anymore i cant get on the scale 2 or 3 time a day iam trying to stop being obsessive about the number weighing and measuring once a month and if i wanna eat raw carrot i will even tough it doesnt fit in my macro it is still much better then a chocolate bar so yeah i have to leave to stop my body got healthy but by brain and relationship with food not yet take care 
1,keto lifestyle initiated thanks to strict medical follow up on pronokal i think some background story is appropriate i've been always a sport kind of guy through high school and early twenty however after 25 i started to gain weight slow at first and probably some can relate that each time i wa on the scale you say to yourself this isn't that bad if you keep doing this get le active because of a hectic professional and personal life and include eating out or choosing fast food instead of cooking up something decent it add up pretty fast fast forward to the present at 38 and the weight scale showed a scaring 102 kg 224 pound now before i had tried keto with success the first time i saw that i wa going to +100kg i managed to get it back down to 94kg 207 pound which is still too heavy since i'm 1m75 5 foot 8 57 64 inch but i wa on a roll right then covid happened seated at home permanently but lucky enough to still have work bread and pasta were within arm reach and i started to gain weight again and an alarming rate until present day having failed to stick to a keto lifestyle since we all know it's not a diet i decided that i needed guidance pronokal i'm not sure how popular or familiar people are with the pronokal method but in belgium it's a kind of diet under the supervision of a doctor every two week i check in measurement are taken and every four week my blood get tested the diet consists of pronokal product of their own combined with 400 gram 1 1 2 cup of largely green vegetable very restricted which one are allowed once you reach a certain target weight you progress to the next step where you'll replace some of their own product with lean meat or chicken for instance at the end you should be eating more or le keto ish i know or believe they re introduce carbs into the diet a well at some point but i'm far from that moment in time the doctor checkup continues up until two year after your last step to make sure you made the correct food adaption and don't relapse a lot of question remain to be answered but it seems that i really need the doctor follow up to motivate me and to continue progress i started this new adventure on march 15th at 102kg 224 pound and the scale this morning after a month indicated 90 7kg 199 95 pound so that's a loss of about 11 kg 24 pound in one month i'm sure the weight loss will slow down after this initial step 1 once i introduce different kind of food again surprise i'm really surprised that i don't miss the carbs sugar etc i used to really enjoy food having two plate of pasta and ice cream afterwards eating lot of bread each day and drinking zero beverage i wa afraid i'd miss all those don't get me wrong we're a family of four and i'm the only one on a diet it's not difficult but sure the smell of french fry with steak from the other people in the family smell delicious but i think a key factor to the success of this and keto in general is that there are no craving i'm full after eating feeling full for a long time and mental clarity is insane i used to be one of those people that would forget anything unless i wrote it down in some todo list or a note app right now i remember work related discussion from four week ago like they happened yesterday it's still a long journey ahead until i reach my target weight of 73kg 161 pound but right now it's looking great and most important i'm feeling great 
1,reduced caloric intake the past 6 7 month i have been i guess crash dieting to 700 800 calorie usually just the same meal everyday with a mix here and there lost 80+ pound but a i am starting to go to the gym i believe i need to raise the calorie in to around 1500 so should i just eat 2 of the meal i eat a day or slowly go back up in calorie intake btw i know this isn t the healthiest way to have lost weight

1,wierd sleep hey guy just got into keto it's been 3 day since i started the keto diet for the first time i have a little problem though i'm a difficult sleeper and have struggled with sleeping problem throughout my life mostly because it take me a while to fall asleep since starting keto i've found it a bit harder to fall asleep maybe this is placebo but i feel like carbs definitely helped me sleep faster now the sleep itself is quite deep and fulfilling compared to when i'm on carbs but my dream are a little scary i also dreamt this morning that i woke up 3 time in a row which wa unsettling for about 10 minute after i woke up i could attribute that to anxiety associated with starting a new diet that drastically change my eating habit but idk perhaps this incident happened because i've eliminated stimulant and that i'm sleeping too deeply what food drink supplement should i consume to ensure that i sleep quickly and without incident please no melatonin supplement i don't like that stuff

1,disheartening result i started keto primarily for weight loss after finding myself the heaviest i ve ever been despite starving myself and calorie counting which only led to binging and a poor relationship with food keto appealed to me a well because i wanted to regulate my blood sugar and not get hangry anymore coming on here i m really inspired by everyone s success story but i kind of feel like maybe i m not doing something right i ve been on keto for nearly 6 week now and after dropping a bunch of water weight in the first week i ve lost 3 pound over about 4 or 5 week which often involved my weight fluctuating quite a bit i suppose it s still good because before i wa out of control gaining weight but it feel a little disheartening after the drop of weight in the first week anyone else felt like this is there something i can do to ensure more weight loss or should i resign myself to it being a tortoise win the race type of scenario thanks

1,keto for vegetarian hi everyone this is probable the 3rd time i am trying keto albeit this time i am starting it with a 5 day extended fast followed by alternate day fasting 36 hour now the reason i discontinued keto last 2 time wa largely because of my inability to have meat chicken lamb on a daily basis i also got an allergy test done and figured i am allergic to egg so the only option for me to do a pure keto is either to have salad everyday or meat every meal which is something too hard for me to continue in the long term i am wondering if someone can guide me on a keto plan for vegetarian also if i follow the 36 hour fasting protocol properly is it fine to have lentil 50g carbs 20g protein adding butter to it with some whole wheat bread once or twice a week any guidance on vegetarian keto recipies would be great to thanks for your help

1,maximizing protein absorption i am getting enough protein to meet my fitness goal and maintain my weight but is it important to try and maximize the absorption of the protein i am eating i have seen anecdotal comment about protein breakdown and acidity but not direct recommendation on eating something acidic to better absorb protein or even whether it matter doe creating an acidic environment in your gut by eating say a salad with a vinaigrette dressing before eating a meal protein maximize absorption 
1,acv morning cocktail hi all i have a cocktail of lemon juice acv and cayenne pepper each morning i care 0 about taste and am strictly interested in health benefit with that said are there any other spice whatever else that i should consider adding to this morning drink note that i fast until 12n 1p every day so i must limit calorie also note i m not trying to cut weight just trying to be a healthy a possible a one potential suggestion is adding coconut oil to a drink uncooked a good idea i have a container of unrefined coconut oil i use strictly for cooking and can scrape some out to mix it into the cup and it s something i ve thought to do to help with ketosis but haven t implemented quite yet

1,my new digital bathroom scale tell me all sort of interesting into i've been doing keto for 9 week now and it say i've lost 9 lb exactly and 2 9 lb of that wa fat just to be clear i have been doing keto for 9 week now and i started using this scale one month after starting so the number and data it is registering is for the last 5 week only in total i have lost 17 lb since starting keto on feb 10 2021 i wish i'd had this scale from the beginning it's really great and tell me all kind of info how many pound of water is in me how much muscle how much subcutaneous fat what my bmi is etc today i finally noticed something else and that wa that it is telling me how many pound of fat i've lost since i started using the scale it came to 2 9 lb of fat gone used up my mom told me today i have strong keto breath i've been eating a lot of meat steak yum cheese egg god so many eggs above ground veggie and pork rind coated in butter coconut oil and natural peanut butter nut and avocado i'm not watching my macro because it's too difficult for me and i'm trying to keep my calorie under 1200 a day and i think i'm doing that because most day i only eat one meal maybe two i've been doing if without realizing it so i know i'm doing this well i have not 'cheated' once since starting this i've got to lose weight for two foot surgery so i am serious doe it sound correct to you guy that out of 9 lb nearly 3 of those were fat i try to get on this scale every day first thing in the morning the more you use it the more info it save and adjusts and tell you it's pretty darn cool i didn't notice the info about the fat until today because i'm legally blind and it's really hard to see my iphone and all of the data it is gathering so thought if this scale is correct it's saying 1 3 of the weight i've lost is actual fat should the percentage be higher what is the other 2 3 made of oh also i have been lifting two 8 gallon milk jug every day now for three solid week trying to build up some strength in my arm five arm exercise and 3 type of squat the amount of muscle the scale say i'm creating is very low just a tiny but i'm trying i keep going 
1,is it bad that i'm eating a half pound of cheese burger sans bun ofc like every day i feel like i already know the answer since it land in my macro but i have to ask anyway for dinner the past week i have been cooking up about a half pound of 80 20 beef and adding cheese i'm not going over macro and am pretty much meeting my protein macro every day but still it feel so wrong haha doe anyone else eat ground beef like all the time i feel like i could do it for a while because it's cheap easy keep me full and i have the spice just right that it taste really good 
1,the keto plan i gave my sister so many people have messaged me or asked on my earlier post what i told her when she asked me how i'd lost the weight and i told her about keto i thought i'd post it here a always i urge you to read this sub's faq it's been my rock and i'm not even exaggerating i basically summarized the faq plus my own little intervention try to keep your carbs under 20 a day but if you do go over don't let it derail you just keep them a low a you can for the rest of the day lean into protein make sure you're getting at least 100 gram a day even if you need to go over your deficit calorie to get there drink ketoade and use salt on your food i gave her the faq recipe weigh and track your food a much a you can again if you can't don't let it derail you do your best and keep going use a food tracker all the time every day if you stop start again when you can she us carbmanager i did but now use cronometer if there is something you really want and will feel deprived and resentful without it make sure you're already full if you can and have one bite of the thing count it a 5 carbs it probably won't be that much and then get rid of the rest the first bite is always the best anyway be kind to yourself this is not a punishment it's not that you can't have carbs it's that you don't want them if you stop eating keto you're not cheating you're just not eating keto it will be there when you're ready to come back to it that's pretty much it when she's had question i've answered them she told me she's gone off keto sometimes but always gotten back on with the next meal keto on everyone

1,is the keto diet right for you although the conversation about the ketogenic diet is widespread many people still find it challenging to tell what is fact or fiction in this article you will gain insight into the myth and fact surrounding the ketogenic diet what is exactly is a keto diet the keto diet work on the principle that by depleting carbohydrate you will burn fat for fuel hence maximizing weight loss it entail a gradual reduction of carbs intake and replacing it with fat keto diet myth fact here are the common keto diet myth and fact myth 1 you can consume any fat fact when practicing ketogenic people consume healthy fat if you want to keep fit avoid saturated fat and focus on organic food rich in fiber to prevent any stomach discomfort space out the quantity of your daily fat intake myth 2 weight loss is the only benefit of keto diet fact contrary to what many believe the keto diet ha immense benefit other than weight loss for instance it enhances cognitive function boost gut health regulates body hormone and stabilizes blood sugar level myth 3 you don't need to exercise fact exercising is highly recommended when you are on a keto diet however to achieve more out of workout ensure you eat adequately and allow enough time for recovery to exercise you may need more carbs and it is essential to up your carb consumption on workout day myth 4 your muscle mass will reduce fact a opposed to the myth people who follow the diet while doing strength exercise gain muscle myth 4 it is characterized by fatigue fact during the adjustment period of the diet you may feel tired but that condition will diminish with time more importantly not everyone experience fatigue during dieting however if you encounter it bear in mind that it won't last beyond a week myth 5 the diet is for a short period fact the duration of the diet intake depends on your health and fitness goal in most case the standard period is between three to five month after this phase you may revert to your regular eating pattern for some week myth 6 there is no science behind the diet fact several scientific study support the ketogenic diet for instance particular research show that the diet wa initially created to help epileptic patient regulate seizure additionally the diet help reduce or maintain body weight myth 7 rich in a lot of fat and protein fact the diet doesn't contain high fat and protein depending on one's training goal the macronutrient is apportioned based on individual requirement for example the typical macronutrient split for this diet includes low carbs high fat and moderate protein myth 8 cause heart attack fact keto diet encompasses the intake of saturated fat which doesn't cause a heart attack final thought this diet can help you improve your fitness and health goal if you want to succeed from the diet it is vital to scrutinize the myth surrounding the diet and adopt evidence based fact

1,fat adaptation question glucose level management fat adapted ketoers and their energy source management aka glucose management hello i came here to get some clarification and confirmation of my understating of energy source management say a carb burner decides to go keto carb burner's primary source of fuel is carbs aka glycogen once carbs glycogen is depleted from muscle and liver reserve his body will start switching to fat burning once he went through 100 round of hell of keto flu his body is learning to adapt to using fat for energy on the condition that carb burner stop eating carbs and we have a fat burner a fat adapted person ketoing for month a fat burner's primary source of fuel is fat although he relies on fat mostly throughout the day night to give him energy after he ate he will still have a glucose spike depending on food he ate the spike will either be steep up and steep down if he ate a bagel for e g or the spike will be more like a hill if he ate 3 egg for e g but he will still have an increase in glucose level gt meaning that this glucose will go into muscle and liver gt meaning that he will be relying on glucose for some time after food intake here come the question s gt now about this last bit of the sequence a his glucose go up his ketone go down 1 doe this mean that he switch to using glycogen a the energy source until his glucose go down ketone go up or he keep using fat a the energy source and carbs that he ate will go into reserve 2 is there a max capacity of glucose reserve if his reserve are full from previous food intake e g what happens with the carbs he ate during the meal so i'm my understanding being fat adapted effectively mean managing your glucose level after you ate you restore glycogen and use it a fuel until next meal after few hour your glucose go down ketone go up and you start using fat for fuel then you eat again and this circle go on until you go to sleep effectively following the above piece you actually have a prolonged period of burning fat only after your last meal e g dinner when you practice intermittent fasting if with a lunch amp dinner regimen you will use fat for fuel only during the night and until your lunch next day question number 3 doe this mean that if you do not follow intermittent fasting and consume something 3 5 time a day doesn't have to be full meal but something that break your fast you effectively always use glycogen a fuel rather than fat because your glucose go up and down and you do not give your ketone a chance to override glucose following the above an if is a must on keto because otherwise you just do not use fat for fuel other than at night here is where i am struggling to understand fat adaptation to the title of this post is fat adaption all about glucose management a written above i hope it clear what i mean and would appreciate your takeaway on the glucose management situation cheer and stay safe

1,keto diet plan for weight loss the whole world is now combating a common problem of human life called obesity http www fitex club some unknown thing about weight loss you should know almost every person in this world is concerned about the extra weight of their body thus they are trying their level best to get rid of the extra pound and they are adopting several way to reach their target some are taking the route of hard exercising some are going through yoga http www fitex club embrace your body with 3 yoga pose but there is another way through which you can get rid of the extra fat of your body here you need to adjust your diet plan a bit and increase the intake of protein food by reducing the carbohydrate during this diet plan you will be given a very little amount of carbohydrate and the same will be replaced by fat and protein since you are reducing the carbohydrate intake in your body it will get to a metabolic state which is named ketosis what is a keto diet http www fitex club what are the danger of the keto diet a question may arise about what is a keto diet normally a person take 50 to 60 of the carbohydrate of his daily meal but in the case of the keto diet you cannot consume that much carbohydrate a carbohydrate is the main source of energy of our body it protects the fat content to generate energy in the body while you reduce the consumption of carbohydrate drastically the body break down the fat cell to make the necessary energy for it physical and physiological work during the keto diet you can only take 30 to 50 gram of carbohydrate so that the blood sugar http www fitex club unhealthy fat deposit around heart from too much sugar level doe not fall and you don t get sick the required energy of the body will be generated by oxidizing the fat cell and it will cause you to shred the excess amount of fat in your body in a keto diet plan almost 50 of the meal contains protein and the rest are made of fat and the least amount of carbs people who want to shred their extra pound quickly and effectively can adopt this diet plan basically a keto diet plan is for a month after that you will have to take a short break of nearly one week and then again you can go for the second phase of your keto diet plan a ketogenic diet is basically a form of diet that doe not have the responsibility to give you proper health it is only used to lose weight early people who are suffering from cardiac problem certain brain disease and have problem with acne are advised to stay away from this kind of diet since the heavy fat content can increase the problem a well though this diet is all about reducing the intake of carbohydrate it eventually increase the intake of fat through different food like butter oil and cheese this is why you require taking proper advice from your doctor a well a a diet expert on whether you can go for this diet plan or not without knowing the proper way of adapting to this diet plan can cause you heavy harm eventually there are some side effect of this diet and people who are capable of tolerating these thing can go for or other specific kind of diet plan preparation before you start a keto diet changing to a different type of diet system requires some preparation of the body you can t switch over to a different kind of food plan suddenly a the body requires getting adapted with it first of all you need to start with the basic of the keto diet it may cause you some uncomfortable moment first up but slowly and gradually it will get adjusted since the keto diet is targeted to reduce the carb intake in your daily meal there will be le than 30 gram of carbs daily in your diet the lack of carbs will be fulfilled by the intake of fat a carbs are the source of energy for the physiological and physical function of the body you require some substitute to cover the lack fat is a very good source of energy in the body and in absence of carbs it will oxidize to generate energy in your body so your meal should be filled with meat cheese nut oilseed egg and other source of fat the same amount of fat give double energy than that of carbs and thus you need to put some low calorie vegetable in your daily meal during the keto diet you should keep some important aspect of it in mind you will not get that much low carb food here and there and thus you need to carry your snack wherever you are going it will cause you a sense of unfulfillment many a time after you eat meal a carbs help to secrete the hormone that give you the signal that you are done with your food taking too much protein diet will definitely cause you some change in the chemical a well a fluid balance in your body it will also affect the balance of mineral in your body too there you may have to take enough salt a well a electrolyte from outside too to keep your body hydrated if you want your keto diet to work faster then you can use some keto salt supplement too there may be several obstacle in your road to weight loss http www fitex club healthy weight loss diet within budget through the keto diet but you need to stay focused and not lose hope thing that you can take during your keto diet since you are not taking carbs in ample amount you need to take such food that will keep you filled without a proper amount of food you may feel starving a well a due to lack of satisfaction after eating you may have mood swing a well so here are some of the best food that you can eat during your keto diet 1 meat meat is a very good source of protein it will help you to build your muscle and shred extra fat in your body there are variety of meat that are available in the market most people who are on the journey of weight loss try to avoid red meat like mutton beef pork and so on but here in the keto diet you can easily go for all kind of meat in other weight loss diet the expert recommend only boiled meat so that no extra oil can get in but in this case you can go for your favorite dish made of chicken or mutton or beef and no one is going to stop you since along with protein you also need ample amount of fat too 2 fish sea fish can be very good source of high protein and essential fatty acid they are actually very tasty and are very good for heart health on the other hand it will provide the necessary amount of protein a well a fat content required for the keto diet plan salmon tuna mackerel trout can be very good option for those who are going through their keto diet plan 3 dairy product milk and dairy product are very essential in this case of diet milk contains almost all kind of micro nutrient which are really necessary it also will give you some amount of carbs along with fat too other than that cheese butter and cream can be beneficial for the person going through the keto diet 4 nut and oilseed these are very important part of the keto diet since they contain essential fat content for your health almond walnut cashew peanut along with flaxseed pumpkin seed are very healthy ingredient in keto diet you can take them through your meal a they will provide you the necessary amount of good fat to keep your internal organ healthy 5 vegetable filled with vitamin and mineral vegetable are very much needed for those who are going through the keto diet vegetable will keep your stomach full and the dietary fiber present in them will definitely keep your stomach healthy vegetable of different color will provide you different type of vitamin a well a mineral too on the other hand they will give you some amount of carbohydrate a well if you are looking for some change of test of your mouth then these veggie will definitely provide you with a different kind of test food that you should avoid during the keto diet when you are going through a keto diet you need to take proper food enriched in protein and fat but the only thing you should avoid is carbohydrate most of the snack available in the market are full of carbohydrate though there are different type of carbohydrate still the snack are mostly made of simple carbs that get into the body and assimilate easily to release energy this is why they get digested quickly and you feel hungry soon after you finish the snack some of the food that you should strictly avoid if you are going through your keto diet plan are mentioned here the first thing that come on the list is bread and bakery food bread is one of the steady food of our daily life http www fitex club this is how you can incorporate healthy activity into your daily life it is a good source of carbohydrate that help you to generate energy for all your work this is why consuming bread and bakery product diet cracker cooky are strictly forbidden in the keto diet plan the second thing that should be avoided is sweet and sugary food sweet are full of sugar and sugar is the finest form of carbs this is why you need to avoid sugar and sweet food very strictly sweetened beverage contain a high amount of sugar so you need to stay away from soda different kind of packaged fruit juice sweetened tea and soft drink on the other hand spaghetti noodle wheat rice cereal potato corn pea pumpkin black bean chickpea citrus fruit like orange grape pineapple and most importantly alcoholic drink should be avoided if you want to get your body fat free really there are different kind of fat too that you should not consume during your keto diet like margarine vegetable oil and so on when you are taking protein a the major contributor to your meal you should definitely try to have fresh meat processed and packaged meat is very much unhealthy and will disturb your goal of losing weight so far we were discussing the food that we should avoid during the keto diet plan but there are some food that we can easily take these food contain healthy fat in good proportion and thus you can consume them to keep your body healthy there are some supplement that you can take like exogenous ketone supplement this is nothing but some extra amount of ketone that you provide to your body from outside medium chain triglyceride give the ketone a boost to keep your body healthy they are also beneficial in term of losing weight gaining energy for your daily work a well a they help in digestion also there are some snack option too for the people who are going through the keto diet almond and cheese are very good source of healthy fat for the body avocado with chicken salad unsweetened coconut nut and seed half boiled egg olive and salami berry can be good snack option for you so that you don t feel starved while you are traveling or you are out of your home for a longer period of time benefit of keto diet 1 the lower the number of carbs in the diet the lower the appetite will be the expert say that sugary and carbohydrate food increase the appetite hunger is the enemy of your diet plan and thus if you will go for a keto diet then you will feel le hungry 2 while you will lower the number of carbs in your meal it will cause drastic weight loss at the start of the diet plan a we all know that carbs are the fuel of our body and thus while there is le supply of carbs in the body it will use the fat to generate the energy for the physical or physiological work of the body this will cause faster shredding of fat from the body 3 like in nature in our body also there are different type of fat available there are different site where the fat are stored the risk of health is thus determined by the deposition of the fat inside the body mostly the fat deposited in the lower abdomen are very harmful this fat is very rigid and thus is the reason for obesity while you lower the number of carbs in your diet you will notice that the fat stored in the lower abdomen is getting shredded very fast the fat which is used to generate energy in absence of carbs is generally supplied from this portion of the body 4 while you lower the amount of carb intake in your body the triglyceride content of the blood fall it is the fat molecule that move through the body along with the blood through the blood vessel thus it reduces the risk of different disease and you can stay safe from the danger of blockage of the blood vessel 5 high density lipoprotein is a very healthy fat content of the body while you decrease the amount of carb intake it gradually increase the hdl level in the body it keep the heart healthy and protects the other organ from danger 6 a soon a you decrease your intake of carbs it cause a lower level of sugar in your blood lower sugar level thus cause lowering the insulin level the keto diet is thus very helpful for those who have blood sugar 7 it also brings the blood pressure under control a increased carbohydrate is the cause of elevated blood pressure too

1,how to actually balance meal where to get the fat hello i would like to give keto a try and i've read a bunch of general thing now a well a reading through the food list with accepteble food for keto so 5 carbs 35 protein 60 fat it is but looking at the list of food where do i get the fat from and how much in actual weight do i need of it eating meat skipping carbs by swapping them out with green veggie is what come to mind for me but i feel like i would end up eating too much protein and don't actually get the fat that i need like this and with the list alone i just can't quite grasp how much i need to eat of what to achieve this 5 35 60 ratio so i wanted to ask if someone could give me an example of a meal that i could theoretically eat every day that would give me all the important nutreints and keep the ratio of course i don't intent to actually only eat this one meal forever but i think it would help me understand how to structure my meal a in how many gram of meat + gramms of veggie + gramms of whatever the fat come from i usually eat 2 meal a day brunch and dinner so a suggestion for brunch + dinner would be nice thanks in advance

1,arguing dirty v clean keto is stupid i've been doing keto for 4 year i primarily do it for it's anti inflammatory and low acid property along with all the other goodness one of the coolest thing i've seen throughout those four year is local store packing new low carb and keto friendly option it's make a sustainable keto lifestyle a lot more cost effective and realistic for example there are literally six different keto bread i can purchase from a number of store in my neighborhood there's pasta keto bakery fucking cereal waffle and all type of new shit and yet there's so much animosity from people staunchly approaching keto with a eat clean mindset a if a function of keto isn't to clean your innards and sure it's fine do a you please what's not fine is dismissing others who have managed to integrate keto into their life their way there are so many new folk that get railed by asshats that have convinced themselves anything processed is anti keto and i believe these folk hurt the keto community personally i think clean dirty keto is bullshit some people have trouble with moderation so they choose a label to help them maintain their goal but in the end nutritional ketosis is nutritional ketosis how you maintain that doesn't matter a long a it work and is healthy for you

1,doctor success went to my new doctor today wa all prepared to give him an education on why keto isn't going to kill me and why my lab look great and i should stop taking my statin soon a he walked in and saw my weight loss he asked if i wa doing keto i wa ready for a smackdown but when i confirmed it he smiled and said awesome job then he went on for 20 minute about how healthy keto is and how he's been bouncing between actual keto and just very low carb for over a year and hasn't felt better then he asked me if i'd be ok with him discontinuing my statin and doing another lipid panel in 6 month to confirm i'm fine without them before i had a chance to bring it up so yeah couldn't have gone better despite me being anxious about having to argue with him about keto it's nice to see that doctor are starting to get up to speed on this stuff finally 
1,after 2 week on clean keto processed fast food made me feel disgusted and unsatisfied i'm writing this post because i thought this might encourage some people to continue on their keto journey backstory i used to be 203lbs 5'9 male back in august now at 164lbs after tonight cheat meal maybe at 169lbs i do back to back water fasting and keto on eating day i eat virtually no sugar on keto not even artificial sugar it seems like my weight loss had stalled at 164 lb so i thought take a break from keto and eat whatever i wanted to get my leptin level up i still ate keto i just couldn't order anything off of uber eats for some reason i just craved broccoli and spinach with a hamburger patty with cheese so i had that for lunch and the same meal for dinner with an organic cookie half of a brownie and some chocolate pretzel so an hour ago i said to myself i need more carbs so i finally went with something on uber eats i went with wendy's i got some nugget fry and a burger big mistake the food tasted so badddddddddddddd like ewwwwww my organic burger tasted way better than the wendy's burger after all these year i finally know why people say to avoid processed food cause i feel like shit now i felt like the meal i had wa not wholesome at all their wa no feeling of pleasure while eating the food so don't give up you may have carb craving or junk food craving and honestly it's not worth it stay on keto and your gut microbiome will crave healthier food

1,the problem with keto so a few week back a friend and i were discussing keto and how it work for so many people we like everyone else decided to try it the 1st week went well i lost 7lb and my friend lost 8lb not that we are competing or anything so far so good right well into my 3rd week i lost 2lb and my friend gained 5lb in the meantime both my brother and my mom got on the kick and the same thing happened to them they lost a good amount of weight the 1st 2 week and then it slowed down drastically after talking with my brother his friend in the nutrition field mentioned a different approach that basically outlined the do's and don't with this kind of diet and set him up with a eating plan did it work yes do i have a friend that is willing to set up a personal eating plan for me the answer is no do i want to pay someone ton of money to tell me how to eat also no but i did some research and there is ton of it on the internet i've been reading the forum article post you name it everything i came across had conflicting info so the same friend that got me started on this keto life style found the keto resource and the 28 day keto online he swears by it and he didn't have to pay someone ton of money so what did i do i paid the 37 it wa on sale and i signed up for the challenge i figured why not it cheap and if it work even better so far i changed my eating habit and i feel le bloated and not a hungry here is the link if anyone is interested i figured i'd share and maybe it will help some more people out http tiny one ketores http tiny one ketores 
1,constantly hungry am i doing keto right i started keto last week and i am hungry a a short male 5'5 hoping to lose some weight here have been my daily macro 1427 calorie 120g fat 71g protein 20g carbs i've been really hungry what am i doing wrong 
1,health question about keto i have been back on keto for almost 5 week and this isn't my first time doing it so to make a long story short sunday night i woke up due to pain in my foot it continued to get worse the next day so bad that in fact that it hurt to walk on the pain wa absolutely horrible i started researching it and came to the conclusion that it might be gout i finally couldn't take the pain anymore and went to urgent care and the doctor confirmed my suspicion it's gout so i did some research and found some conflicting information one article said keto can cause it but only at first and that keto actually help prevent it due to helping inflammation another article no mention of keto but other health factor one say avacados are a cause but another it's high fat dairy almost all say high intake of meat chicken beef pork some seafood sugary drink and alcohol are a cause which blow my mind because i'm not eating high protein or high amount of dairy ha anyone dealt with this with keto before is it very common i would love to know your thought on this 
1,keto cured my chronic cock ache my penis always used to have a constant yet mild achey feeling to it this would interrupt my social life massively a i would zone out mid conversation distracted by the discomfort in my shaft during the 'keto flu' the ache spread to my ball a well after i began adding sodium to my sea water the pain completely went away now i can finally hold eye contact with my cousin the only person who talk to me without being taken from the present moment god bless keto 
1,sustainable keto life after reaching health goal i wa thinking about the usnews s poor ranking of the keto diet which in my opinion is written based ignorance rather than reality however i want to know what other long term keto dieter do in sustaining mode and maybe give people starting on the diet encouragement to continue or is it actually difficult to sustain for the majority my own experience on sustaining after 2 year of strict keto and reaching my goal body fat and weight i relaxed the protocol and would treat myself to ice cream w real sugar almost daily 2 scoop lt 20 g carbs and do not restrict carbs on the weekend however carbs feel so filling now that i can only eat once a day on the weekend blood test show i m still always in ketosis any weight gained from a weekend of carbs disappears by mid week and i haven t had dream about eating carbs for the last 2 year in fact carbs make me feel so full so quickly that i tend to avoid any old carbs and only eat carbs i really love like ice cream and french fry amp x200b is usnews correct that keto is unsustainable what ha caused you to stop this woe and did you gain all your weight back or is your long term experience after reaching your goal similar to mine

1,what am i doing wrong 26f sw 215 8 cw 209 gw 150 today mark 3 week doing keto i weigh every friday and today i got on the scale and it showed i gained a pound in addition to keto i keep calorie under 1300 and only eat between 12pm 8pm i work out 3 day a week 30 minute of interval running on a treadmill and 20 minute of weight and ab the first week i lost 4 1 lb and the second week i lost 3 6 lb but now i gain a pound is there any reason why this is happening i got on and off the scale a dozen time because i couldn t believe it i feel so discouraged i wa really hoping to hit my first goal of being under 200 by next week and now that doesn t seem likely 
1,psa bang keto coffee at 7 11 ha sucralose which cause insulin spike iow not necessarily ketotic there's a 7 11 right next to our house and i stopped in while walking the dog this morning a coffee can with the word keto emblazoned across it caught my eye the brand is bang i'm sure they are well intentioned creating a sweetened coffee product with almost zero net carbs and 20g protein but the idea that just having zero net carbs is what put people in ketosis is a very rudimentary understanding of ketosis a lot of people who continue to drink sucralose splenda or aspartame sweet n low product while on keto diet will often become frustrated that they are not in deep ketosis insulin spiking sweetener are often the culprit sweetener such a stevia and monkfruit do not cause an insulin spike but they taste weird if you can tolerate them that's great otherwise try to just drink cold brew or straight coffee 
1,egg fast ha anyone tried it basically you eat 6 8 egg everyday at your normal eating time for 3 5 day to help you get into ketosis so i guess it's not just egg you can have cheese heavy cream butter and condiment i also read about some version that added bacon etc i did keto a couple of year ago and it worked i lost about twenty pound in two month i've done it on and off since then but i'm having a harder time with it now i wa wondering if this is a good way to jumpstart it seems effective but also hard 
1,thought on net carbs v total carbs which do you follow first time i did keto year ago i really focused on net carbs subtracting fiber and sugar alcohol etc i aimed for about 20 net carbs a day now i m back on the wagon following the virta program which i love they want u under 30 total carbs which i m finding harder to stick to i found some keto bread at costco with 12 carbs 12 fiber so 0 net carbs but i thought one slice and i will go through almost half my day allowance i m curious how much credence people give to the net carb and if you feel it make a difference to stick with total carbs regardless of fiber etc 
1,this time it's different been doin keto on and off for year now when still being a bachelor i basically kept binging on grilled meat with mayo bacon amp egg and maybe some fish from time to time this time it's a little different i moved in with my girlfriend a few month ago and due to covid i am in home office and she's at the office so i am doing the cooking she agreed on hoping onto the train with me but she wasn't really a friend of all meat all mayo all day all month so i had to mix thing up and it ha been a glorious ride since avocado kale cellery took me 26 year to find out that i love that shit spinach salad pea and so on i fucking love it first of all the variety of my keto food went through the roof secondly due to the green i get much more fiber in therefore i am not nearly shitting myself 24 7 and lastly the green seem to make my breath not a bad a it used to be on dirty keto furthermore i feel more well rounded this time and it doesn't feel completely different from my normal diet fyi i use the eatthismuch org app for my meal plan really loving it just wanted to share my thought on my cleaner keto experience love y'all 
1,sudden health benefit of keto i have a question for long time ketoers i know keto can be very helpful for type 2 diabetes and pcos but how about other benefit here's my story i'm a 38 y o female i ate strict keto last 4 month lost around 18 lb started to workout a i reached the upper limit of normal bmi i read many time that keto and heavy workout are working bad together and wanted to try the standard fitness diet aka moderate carbs high protein low fat after around five day every of my chronic inflammation problem weak bladder tonsil terrible bloating were back i can't make me think that's just a coincidence have somebody notice that keto help your smaller health problem like headache joint pain etc i'm going to stick to keto a a lifestyle for a long time now 
1,mouth sore from erythritol and tea i have been on the keto journey for around 4 year now doing the roller coaster version 3 month on 2 week off since the beginning i have been eating dessert with erythritol mostly atkins dessert and a few other brand about 6 month ago i started to drink decaffeinated tea in the morning about 3 month ago i started drinking it after dinner a well after eating my meal which always included an erythritol laden dessert and then drinking tea the inside of my mouth would start breaking out in these ulcer hive they would literally be all over the inside of my mouth and sometimes on my tongue it took me a bit to understand what wa actually causing it it only happens if i drink tea after my meal if i drink tea after my meal without having any erythritol no reaction either i also tried different kind of decaffeinated tea a i know some use chemical in the process of decaffeination but it seems not to matter what type i use i still get the reaction any idea what could be causing this chemical reaction or just an allergy to the combination my body doesn't like thanks 
1,civilization are built on farming this is a question that ha been rolling around in my mind and frankly bothering me quite a bit if you look at it historically every great civilization in the world ha been built on a grain yet we who are having success with keto are not supposed to eat grain i got the idea about civilization being built on grain from jared diamond and his book gun germ and steel among his other work example the far eastern civilization were built on rice the roman empire and the civilization in the fertile crescent were built on wheat and barley the mesoamerican civilization that is the aztec and the mayan etc were built on corn and potato it wa grain and the farmer that grew them that allowed the civilization to produce enough calorie that they didn't have to be hunter gatherer all the time and could therefore build on their art and science i've come to my own conclusion about why this is so but i would like to hear from other folk on keto your thought a to how grain and starch became such a miserable problem for many of u

1,to the people who did keto for migraine how long did it take you to see improvement i'm a little over 4 week into medical keto with about a 1 1 fat to protein carb ratio 15 carbs 75 85 protein 100+ fat and so far have not noticed migraine improvement i'm carefully monitoring food and electrolyte i also monitor my ketone and glucose i'm not on keto for weightloss and i know that this sub mostly us it for weightloss instead of medically but wondered if anyone out there could give me some insight since this sub is bigger than the medical keto one i know there is a time period it take to get fat adapted and that may be the time when improvement start but i expected if it worked for me i would have seen improvement sooner i don't think i'm fat adapted yet because i'm still very tired yes my electrolyte and calorie are good is it still too soon to throw in the towel or did most of you see improvement before the 1 month mark my ketone fluctuate anywhere between 1 5 4+ if i use mct oil i usually can get it to the 4 range i could possibly trial a 1 2 fat please only respond if you do keto for a medical reason

1,keto+ omad saved my life ill start by saying i share this story to try to inspire others who are in a similar situation i'd also like to thank the kind folk here at r keto for the support and great tip i am now approaching 4 month on the ketogenic lifestyle and have never felt better within a few short month i have went from obese and depressed to truly a new person i still have those pesky stretch mark but besides those my body ha loved the lifestyle change and trust me being skinny and having stretch mark is a whole lot better than being fat with stretch mark if you are on the fence about starting keto please take the leap and just go for it the appetite suppression is one of my absolute favorite part about keto it ha this weird way of making the diet turn into a healthy lifestyle i never set a goal for myself and just kept trying to stay consistent with my macro i am blessed to have lost almost 60lbs so far on my keto journey i am finally approaching my goal weight but have no plan to stop keto people say keto is a fad and they couldn't be more wrong keto truly ha turned my life around for the better and i figured posting in the place which gave me the most support would be a fitting end to a great day thank you r keto

1,high h crp i ve been working with my doctor the last 8 month to identify the cause of my high h crp we re are fairly sure it not associated with diet but rather my actual body fat level this seems like a catch 22 the fat is causing my chronic inflammation but chronic inflammation inhibits several pathway involved in fat mobilization and metabolism i still have at least 50 pound before i get to my goal weight i m currently eating 2 25 pound of 90 20 ground sirloin 2oz beef liver heart pate 6 egg yolk 1 tbps of butter a quarter cup of olive 1 can of sardine in water 8oz of beef broth i have none of the classic symptom of inflammation like brain fog or ache joint i lift full body 3 day a week and walk 4 mile daily i have also been fasting for 2 day the last month my issue isn t that i m not losing weight i m curious if their are any novel treatment idea that can address my inflammation so i can maximize my next 8 week of this fat loss phase every other marker of health is perfect from fasting insulin to lipid 
1,a warning about electrolyte i have been on keto for several month and thought i should share a keto caused negative health related experience i had recently that at the time really frieked me out but once i did some more research i wa able to remedy and prevent in the future i had been doing omad keto lazy just counting carbs for a few month when i started to get some aching pain in my foot and knee a well a had a couple night where i had pretty bad leg cramp i didn't really pay much attention and actually thought i wa dehydrated so i started drinking more water on a regular basis i think this wa a mistake because over time the pain got slightly worse and one day i actually ended up having my vision go blurry very suddenly and i developed an absolutely horrible headache that hospitalized me i've never had headache like this one could definitely be classified a a migrane a it wa absolutely unbearable those of you with more keto experience probably already know what happened they ran test and everything looked normal i did however have potassium on the low end of normal a well a sodium and magnesium were in the lower end i did some more research which i should have done in the first place and it became very clear that i wa not consuming enough electrolyte i am starting to think supplementing electrolyte during long term keto is something that should really be pushed a a necessity for newcomer i do wonder how many people end up writing off this diet because they had an experience like mine since the event i have been supplementing 400mg of potassium and magnesium and 1000mg of sodium per day since i started i gave felt all around much better both mentally and physically while in ketosis tldr i wasn't supplementing electrolyte on omad keto and i ended up being hospitalized with the most painful headache i've ever had supplementing ha fixed my issue and made me feel better

1,tip for ketogenic diet 1 drink water before and after meal to suppress hunger and make you feel fuller 2 stay hydrated it's just healthy and help any form of weight loss 3 get some exercise in nothing crazy 30 minute of walking is all you need maybe 3 7 time a day exercising is not required for weight loss in keto diet 4 try to eat a far into the day a possible so you don't end up eating too often 5 limit how many meal you eat a day to avoid feeling on a keto diet you shouldn't feel hungry very often because your body is in ketosis so take advantage of that to decrease caloric intake make sure to diversify your food and get some veggie in to get proper nutrition 6 avoid environment where non keto food are available this is obvious but very important if for example your family is eating cooky in the kitchen stay in your room doing something else 7 keep in mind that the beginning of starting a keto diet is the hardest then your craving will go away and so is your appetite 8 you can still overeat on keto no matter what diet or exercise plan you're on if you're overeating you'll see le result make sure that you're eating slowly and not having big proportion 9 best to limit yourself up to 20 carbs it's a limit not a goal you don't have to try to hit 20 carbs realize that this is the recommended maximum to guarantee ketosis 10 if you mess up it's okay i didn't stick to the keto diet on my first try you have so many more time to try again forgive yourself realize you can't change the past and move on

1,threw up possibly from exogenous ketone and coffee during if i know exogenous ketone isn t necessary at all for keto but curiosity got the best of me and i had to try it i especially wanted to see how they worked during a fast i ve been trying them twice a day pill form the package say to take two for the past 4 day with meal i ve had no issue but the past two morning i ve taken them on an empty stomach because of intermittent fasting followed with my usual coffee right after about an hour later i felt sudden discomfort and had to vomit urgently this happened in the exact same way and timeframe both morning after vomiting i felt fine coffee a few hour later still no food wa also ok i ve been doing if and some 36hr fast for the past 1 5 month with absolutely no issue and coffee on an empty stomach ha been just fine absolutely no discomfort or anything so i m assuming the ketone have something to do with it could it be the combination with coffee combination of mineral vitamin i m also taking multivitamin magnesium and extra iron because i donated blood last week but also no problem with these alone with coffee i love the if lifestyle and don t want to give up on the ketone just yet i at least want to try a longer fast first doe anyone have a remotely similar experience or just know in general what the issue could be should i only take them during longer fast drop the morning coffee or take the two pill during my eating window thank you sorry if this is dumb haha

1,normal to lose weight this fast ive been on keto for 3 month now losing steady weight 3lbs week but the past 10 day ive been losing around 0 5 lb daily and im not trying to lose weight this hard im mostly full during the day and dont feel the need to eat 
1,any restart keto pointer i posted similar 2 day ago but somehow disappeared keto for march strict adherence except early on when i misunderstood some key idea and didnt have macro correct end of march here wa easter last week and in denmark thats a 5 day long weekend with lot of visit and visiting so i just relaxed for 5 day restarted on monday with 1551kcal 154p 20c 95f along with intermittent fasting 16 8 my weight fluctuates so much that it hard to say if i really gained weight back but for sure beer candy and pasta were on the menu not worried about it i ran for 45 minute yesterday felt strong so for sure glycogen store available plan to run again today maybe a bit longer to burn out my leg then do a 24 hour fast sound like a plan postnote enjoyed the pasta and goody but had a decent amount of unexpected guilt surrounding this i mention because i think many would agree in the course of a year there will be time where it just very practical to suspend the strictness i know i want to continue with the macro etc for a few reason i feel better for one but learning how to navigate these schedule is a good skill that month of being strict got easier and easier then now restarting is second nature almost i think that will become the norm for me any changing of macro and kcal will be a function of targeted carbs etc once other workout are introduced after the lockdown is over we'll see

1,don't give up just wanted to share a bit about my journey i have posted a picture of me at my daughter's birthday party in october of last year and a picture of me present day i have tried multiple different diet pill drink bar and just about everything else you could think of one of my closest friend wa nearly 400lbs when his dr told him that his life wa in danger and he needed to make a change he researched the keto diet and started it i wa amazed at his result after seeing myself in those picture at my daughter bday i decided to give it a try at first i felt stupid for trying another diet that would most assuredly fail i felt like an idiot eating my hotdog and burger without bun i felt like a girly man switching from ipa beer to no carb seltzer i missed gorging myself in pasta and bread and doughnut oh my god the doughnut but i told myself i would give it an honest try for a week and see what happens i weighed in at the end of that week and had lost 4lbs it wa full speed ahead from there the real reason i wanted to make this post is because there were multiple time in the last 7 month that i wa stuck at one weight range and thought i would never lose anymore it frustrated the hell out of me but i stuck to it you have to stick to it at one point it took me an entire month to get from 247 to 245 i started a 20 minute hit workout on my rowing machine 3 time a week and went fully religious on the keto diet i gave myself a goal to get to 230lbs because that is the weight that google told me i would no longer be obese at my height lol in the picture at my daughter's party i wa 283lbs today i weighed in at 231 if you are stuck and you are frustrated i came here today to say don't stop get more physical drink more water you can do this keto weight loss http keto weight loss http imgur com a y45kv5f

1,who is the anti dieter in your life and how do you deal with them there always seems to be somebody for me it's my father inlaw i literally can't discus food or take a bite in front of him without it turning into a massive conversation about how i need to stop torturing myself and how i should just eat whatever i want i've explained countless time that i love the option on keto and i'm not at all suffering he actually get aggravated with me over it it's really quite pathetic he smoke 1 to 2 pack of cigarette a day in addition to 8 to 10 cup of coffee with a shitload of sugar and enormous amount of junk food in the 8 year i've known him i've never seen him eat anything healthy and i've not once said a word yet i'm the issue because i lost 22lbs and joined a gym and are in the best shape of my life it's at the point that i'm about to stop being so damn nice and start firing back i don't want to become that person it's just not me i might not have a choice it's making my blood boil anyone else have to deal with this shit 
1,any other t1d's sick of other t1d's being anti keto i am a t1d of almost 18 year with a normal a1c i acheived this through low carb when you're diagnosed they tell you to keep your a1c a low a possible to decrease the risk of complication decrease but not eliminate people who have well controlled diabetes still get complication and it happens often i am in a few group for diabetes on different social medium platform i occasionally leave comment on post mentioning that i have a normal a1c and people occasionally inquire about it so i talk to them i wa recently talking to the mother of a 6 year old who wa diagnosed at the end of last year she asked how i got to a normal a1c so i explained after a while she started asking if i ate normally on vacation i told her no because my basal rate and carb ratio are all programmed for low carb so i'd go through the roof if i started eating carbs again and on top of that if i'm on vacation i definitely don't want to risk ruining my day with roller coaster blood sugar her response wa that she wanted her daughter to be normal and not live with so many restriction i wa left scratching my head having food restriction is far from unusual in this day and age and furthermore isn't going blind having your foot amputated and being on dialysis more restrictive than not eating a candy bar i've also been told that the keto diet is dangerous and unhealthy and a whole bunch of other thing i just don't understand how people can argue against keto the result of which can clearly be seen and then turn around and wonder why their blood sugar is 400+ and they don't feel well

1,terrible carb crash for background i started keto after bulking from 182 to 209 over the course of 6 month or so i lift weight everyday with pretty intense training session i had done keto in the past and the first week i d feel foggy lack of focus had some slight vision issue which made driving difficult i d stop to turn look left then right and completely forget what the left side looked like but it would fade after the first week this time i went from 209 to 197 in 9 day started incorporated light cardio at the end of my lift a well i felt exactly how i expected to feel foggy etc but after about 16 day of it i never got out of the carb crash and mental fogginess simple mental math became almost impossible in the gym i felt great energy wise but i lost about 10 12 of strength on all of my one rep max s in the bench squat and deadlift which didn t happen the last time i did no carb keto in fact last time i did keto i wa making new person record in the gym my bench went from 300 to 270 for example i started eating carbs again with each meal but a much reduced amount than i used to for example half a bagel with my breakfast instead of 2 whole bagel with my chicken turkey bacon and veggie breakfast i had to start eating carbs again to get my mental performance back my ability to do mental math at work and safely operate my car are much more important than getting a little extra shredded quicker did i do something wrong any insight will help thanks

1,colon broom seeing a lot of positive review of colon broom and keto diet is causing mild constipation worried this product would take me out of ketosis the nutrition info say 20 calorie per scoop 4g total carbs and 3g of dietary fiber and 2 gram of soluble fiber idk what soluble fiber is but wondering if anyone ha had success with this product thanks 
1,bean on a keto diet my nutritionist ha been really concerned with how little carbs i'm consuming while my blood work back in january came back fine a little low on the good cholesterol but i've started incorporating more fatty fish and avocado the few time we've spoken and i've told her what i've eaten she really want me to try incorporating at least one meal a day with some good carbs like black bean i'm super apprehensive because i already feel like i'm kind of plateauing i've only dropped 1 lb in the past week and i'm worried that if i incorporate more carbs i'll only gain weight i currently only consume on average 10 ish carbs a day sometimes more 20 max sometimes le at least 5 i've thought about portioning a can of low sodium black bean to eat over a week and only adding a tablespoon or two of black bean to one of my meal a day which would be 2g of carbs per tablespoon any advice would be appreciated

1,how do you guy deal with mozzarella i've been doing keto for a few week now and a lot of recipe i've used especially for anything bready use grated mozarella i tried using fresh mozarella ball but it turned out nightmarishly so i tried ready grated and it wa perfect consistency of the thing i'm making instantly improved i realise this is due to water content however after indulging in a fathead pizza tonight i realised while logging my meal for the day that the pre grated stuff contains a lot more carbs 3 9g in my dinner i assume because of flour used to dry it out thankfully after logging my day i came in at 18g so still keto but it wa close and i wa trying hard to follow keto recipe had a light snack for lunch because i knew i wa having the pizza for dinner and haven't eaten between meal today i wa shocked at how easily i had come so close to being out of keto and wonder how often this happens or if indeed i am even in ketosis because maybe i havent been looking closely enough so how do you guy tackle mozzarella do you have a method for drying fresh stuff out do you just use the pre grated and factor it in to your macro for the day i'd love to hear from people more experienced in the balance of keeping carbs low

1,keto tip for beginner hi new to this group but have been doing keto for 2 month now and it ha really changed my life i m 2 month in and 29 lb down my confidence ha increased dramatically and i wa surprised out how stable my mood been no more mood swing or day where i ve felt unhappy for no reason whatsoever at first i found it hard due to me being a big snacker and worst of all snacking on carb heavy food like sandwich anything that s easy to grab basically but once you figure out what food you can have and what food to avoid it s actually very easy to adjust your lifestyle to implement keto my advice to anyone new is to do your research the faq ha a lot of great info on keto and it s laid out in a way that s easy for beginner to understand another page i found http site google com view ketodietfactsonline home is very good aswell quick and to the point which is how i like to live my life no big long article to read just info summarised to help you i also signed up for the keto meal plan they have on the website but it definitely isn t necessary it just helped me because i m very busy and work 55 hour a week so it saved me time in trying to think of recipe to make and all that jazz it definitely worked anyway so if anyone s busy it s a very good plan to follow the main thing to remember is keto work summer just around the corner but with keto you can have the body of your dream by then it can be tough but just think of the result let me know what all of your experience have been like i love hearing a good success story 
1,doe keto have to be complicated i see a lot of vitamin v too much protein etc i want to give keto another try i always initially view it a alright just cut the carbs sugar and accept that potato bread and pasta are gone from life i figure i'll stick with meat and green veggie but then i see people discus vitamin and electrolyte and how some meal plan need supplement in the form of mult vitamin or something amp x200b then i remember this is why i always find keto so daunting it seems like there's so much consider so much calculating counting making sure macro fit amp x200b doe it have to be this complicated or can i just start eating one maybe two meal a day consisting of a big piece of meat and a pile of keto friendly veggie 
1,blood glucose and weight loss i'm a type 2 diabetic eschewing med so i've been doing keto+if and tracking both my blood glucose level and weight daily my diet ha been pretty consistent for the past several week since i started tracking all this my fasting blood glucose bg ha been low 90 mg dl to low 100 and are typically between 110 and 120 2 hour after a meal every now and then i'll get a postprandial bg reading that's between 15 to 20 mg dl higher than usual it's not necessarily because of what i've eaten a i said i've been eating pretty consistently i'll just rotate through some group of food over and over so this just mean that for whatever reason the same low carb meal that i typically eat will cause my bg to increase when this happens almost without fail my weight the following morning will be between 0 6 and a full pound lower than the previous morning i'm not sure if the higher bg is causing me to piss more or something but there seems to be a correlation note though that i am not advocate that you eat more carbs to cause your bg to go up i'm just saying that on the occasion that my typical keto meal cause my bg to go up for whatever reason it seems to be a precursor to a drop in weight

1,i did not loose weight on keto after 1 year but i did loose 10 body fat and gained even more muscle self esteem and cognitive skill link http imgur com a ag2id4w first i want to say that this transformation is nothing compared to what i ve seen in this sub weight wise you guy are amazing but we all have our struggle regardless of the weight of the scale and this shit is about taking responsibility for yourself and your value your self esteem is the reputation that you have with yourself and it s always watching you to see if you re living through your value so a year ago little before my birthday i felt horrible i worked 72h w in a sale job i wa doing great sale wise with all time high record here and there but that shit doesn t matter i still destroyed my body and mind you know just to be able to sustain the long and intensive day i had to constantly eat i ate 6 tasty cheese every fricking day + breakfast and dinner that s just absurd but of course understandable considering the huge amount of stress the job gave me in combination with not living truthfully with myself after reflecting deeply on my value i decided to quit my job and pursue what i wanted which wa running why own company and getting my grade up so i did just that i decided that i wanted to have a body fat of 15 and hit 120kg bench press which i thought wa impossible at first so i did just that this is actually about deciding who you want to be and sustain meaningful effort amp suffering because suffering is not bad it s quite good well it s actually a gift to be able to suffer for something meaningful and is the fundamental thing for most success but if you have no direction and no meaning behind the suffering it s a recipe for all kind of mental disorder which will lead to other negative consequence anyway subscribe like and comment also buy my new book and merch and sticker and signatured air in a bottle link in bio no but seriously thank you for reading this

1,net carb or full carbs hi all i'm a newbie to reddit and keto i even had to google how to post to a group so i'm confused a to whether we should be counting carbs minus the fibre or total carbs this would make a huge difference for example a typical avacado has13 5g carbs but 10 5g of fibre giving net carbs of only 3g if i opted to count net carbs instead of full carbs would it slow down weight loss i am half way through week 2 and have lost 6 5 lb by counting full carbs thank you fellow ketonians 
1,question about ferritin ha anyone notice ferritin go up on keto mine ha jumped up substantially yet my iron is normal i saw a question on this on you tube noting that it wa happening to people on keto the first suggestion wa copper deficiency but i eat plenty of salmon and dark chocolate so that shouldn't be an issue my best guess is that i wa having too much red meat and spinach though i wa only having it like 2 x per week it just seems shocking that food could do it but anyone else have this happen

1,keto and muscle building podcast i wanted to link this podcast episode regarding muscle building and keto http youtu be u3cn_89rpqc ben pakulski is someone who i've actively followed for a long time and who's muscle building program have given me great success he isn't someone who actively promotes a ketogenic diet but doe follow the principle of it even before i had ever heard of the word keto in his program he always promoted a protein and high fat breakfast he's never sought to be in an active state of ketosis but doe promote a carb free approach to starting the day and pre training nutrition for the clarity and mental focus it provides over carb loaded meal anyway this episode is him with someone talking about following a keto diet and training for muscle building it wa good for me a a newbie to get an understanding into what actually happens on a keto diet and how you can utilise it benefit it might not be for the seasoned ketoers because you might already have a lot of this knowledge but for people starting out or those who just want more knowledge it's a good listen imo i'm someone who recently started keto for fat loss but would like to continue it in some form long term without necessarily being uber strict with carb counting every day of the year but understanding what is happening in my body and adapting to how it responds

1,worried about my brother falling for a fraud hey so my brother tried keto with me and my mom in january and of course he quit it even before keto flu hit him said it wa too restrictive for him it's his life his body and i promised him that i would leave him alone although we both know that he is the one in severe need to lose weight idk the stats he wouldn't tell me but if i had to guess he might have around 350lbs being 5'5 you should hear him panting after climbing 5 stair he ha u worried now some company came up with yet another wonder drug they even call it 'keto' and claimed that one teaspoon in the evening would get you right on the full keto train and you lose 50lbs in two week no exercise no eating restraint the stuff is made of a mixture of hemp oil olive oil and some amino acid nothing else i know this must be fraud you just don't go keto over night by swallowing oil especially not when keeping carbs in your diet the crucial thing is he want to buy this ridiculously expensive stuff and actually think it will help him without cutting out coke fast food and all the other unhealthy stuff he put in his mouth every day how can i make him see that this is just the same make believe a any other wonder drug ha anyone heard of this and maybe have reliable source i couldn't find anything except ad for it and the tv show where they presented it sorry for the lengthy post

1,macro help okay so apparently i ve been doing my macro completely wrong i m doing 120 140g of fat le than 20g of carbs and 80 90g of protein i wa told my diet should consist mostly of protein and not to worry too much about fat and well of course keep up with carbs i m 5 6f 263lbs amp 24yo i m not going over 1800 calorie but i typically never reach that anyway i eat between 800 1600 calorie day typically i probably eat 1400 1500 calorie a day i ve only been doing it for almost a week now but 1800 is a my max and i guess give me a little leeway incase i get hungry i m also doing if if that matter 16 8 but thinking about going to 18 6 permanently or 20 4 at least two day out of the week can you guy help me come up with the correct amount of mafros for me 
1,loose skin i just started keto almost a week ago and i m worried about loose skin i heard that fish oil can help but of course your age genetics how much you lose in the time period also all play a factor i m doing cardio 3 4x week a well a mainly glute leg every other day out of those time period i ve only lifted weight once but don t want to over do it so i might do it every other day or twice a week i m 5 5f 263lbs amp i m 23yo and i plan on losing about 100 120lbs depending on how i look and feel once i get to the 80lb mark then i will determine how much i want to lose after that i know since i m younger my skin will probably bounce back faster but i wa just wondering your experience and what you have done to try to combat or even fix it after losing a lot of weight i m also doing if 16 8 everyday but i think i might do 20 4 or 18 6 at least two day out of the week

1,macro panic anyone hi all firstpost here almost done with week 3 of my first keto diet and if i'm working with a trainer and he's got me on strict daily macro 31 carbs or le 114 fat 170 protein about 1830 calorie while i've adopted to some aspect of the diet pretty well i love a big lunch with meat cheese and avocado and the return of red meat to my diet but i have yet to fully hit my macro i've come close like today i'm closing in on 240 calorie to go with 72p 7f 5c remaining but that's rare and what i've noticed is that i get in trouble towards the end of the day when i still have 400 500 calorie left with a decent amount of p and f too yet no carbs left to spend i find myself panicking and trying to find something fatty to ingest right before my fasting cutoff i've done everything from melting down coconut oil with peanut butter to making an after dinner smoothie of protein powder and mct oil and don't think i haven't contemplated eating half a stick of butter out of desperation i know some of this is my old mindset too few calorie during sensible meal while supplementing with carb heavy snack and trying to retrain myself to eat heavier meal i also realize that i could be meal prepping more so that i have good stuff on hand to snack on whether it be hard boiled egg or homemade fat bomb but i'm curious to know what y'all do to make sure you hit your daily goal and how you fill yourselves up at the end of the day if you're too far under tia

1,my first post ever on reddit is a thank you to this sub i've been reddit user for over 2 year but this is my first post and it's a huge thank you to this sub i've tried keto several time before over they year and lost 10 ish pound before falling off the wagon each time i started reading this sub in late 2020 for inspiration and to learn 2020 wa hard for me like everyone which caused some stress baking and the correlating stress eating in addition i had a severe 2nd degree ankle sprain in january 2020 followed by a horrible bout of sciatica in october 2020 that plagued me into the new year i wa sick and tired of feeling sick and tired and painful and i knew my weight of 205 lb at 5'5 and age 40 wasn't helping thing at all i knew i needed to shed some pound to be able to get active without pain i made the lifestyle change one random day in mid january 2021 i don't remember exactly which day i just remember which week i stayed on top of my electrolyte and macro with carbmanager and while the first week wa hard after that i wa feeling pretty good minimal keto flu then the positive change started i previously suffered a form of insomnia couldn't stay asleep through the night which disappeared pretty quickly i live with adhd which i've never needed to medicate to function but holy moly i have a mental clarity that i have never known before my back pain and ankle pain have basically disappeared whether it's directly due to weight loss or reduction in inflammation i don't know and i don't care either no matter how you slice it this lifestyle is doing amazing thing for me so this gal sat at 205lbs somewhere in mid january yesterday i broke through 180 to land at 178 6 i credit reading the great advice and motivational story on this sub with my success i wa stuck around 184 for a couple of week until i read here that i should recalculate my macro every 10lbs down and that really the only macro i needed to hit or exceed wa protein and to eat fat to satiety rather than trying to hit the macro these 2 thing together made the scale move down again i started obese and a of yesterday i'm down to the overweight category though i believe bmi is mostly bullshit but i don't have body fat caliper or anything else to help me calculate where i'm at health wise and have reduced some health risk factor my first goal is to get to 170lbs still overweight but i feel it's a midway marker for me my ultimate goal is to get to about 140 lb and feeling strong i may go to maintenance sooner if i feel i've made it because i don't want to be skinny i want to be strong healthy and confident again thank you everyone who's contributing regularly with reading your story and tip i don't feel like stepping off this path one bit 
1,doctor and test 1 what diet or fitness related medical test have you had that best informed your diet or fitness decision and action ex i just had a dexascan this helped me figure out the right amount of protein to maintain lean body mass my smart scale estimated 10 higher lean body mass not needing needing a much protein help me not go over total calorie and fat gram 2 if you meet with a specialist doctor related to your keto diet and fitness goal how did you approach researching this i'd like to meet with a doctor periodically to ass progress and change given my specific situation since most doctor are now zoom friendly the scope of my search can be u wide not just where i live in austin texas ideal qualification 1 keto knowledgeable friendly 2 fitness and weight training knowledgeable 3 able to prescribe specific medical test ex resting metabolic rate continuous glucose monitoring to see what i respond to the most that food inflammation marker test etc 3 is the main reason i need this person to be a doctor i'm meeting with a dietician but she can't prescribe anything even just for fsa reimbursement 4 ideally this person would be an endocrinologist or endo smart because my thyroid wa removed i'd guess there are very few md in the u who meet all the 4 qualification any doctor recommendation or suggestion for how to approach researching this

1,keto and exercise and tracking hey everyone lost 30 pound over a decade ago and mostly kept it off but have about 10 i've gotta drop because covid i generally do a low carb diet in life and that is what is responsible for keeping most of the weight off but that is not keto i try and keep my carbs below 60 80 per day but now i'm back to keto to drop the 10 my question for you i play hockey and my fitbit tell me that burn a ton of calorie do those of you who do big workout adjust your daily carb intake on those day i'm using the carb manager app and by default it will adjust my macro up based on activity but i'm wondering if it's best just to turn that feature off and keep myself on target what do you do if this is somewhere in a faq my apology didn't see it

1,keto round 3 so a little about my keto experience i tried it a few year ago with little success after not doing much research and not being a strict that lasted a month or so with little result went back to normal eating habit cut to a month before the pandemic got serious i started up keto with my gf at the time really serious with it counting calorie and meal prepping who would of thought it could be successful if you dedicate to it a few month into the pandemic with lockdown in full force i'm down probably 40 or so lb relationship ended and she moved out but that motivated me for some reason and about september or so i wa at a huge milestone of almost being under 200lbs i started at nearly 280 i costed for another could month and got really close to getting into the 100 i'm pretty sure there wa a month where i wa depressed and lost motivation so i got off of keto thinking i could control my calorie intake and start working out this didn't work out my urge to overeat came back and i fully fell off the wagon so that wa 4 or so month back i'm back up to around 260 i'm living in a new apartment got my first vaccine coming up finally thing may go back to normal i'm currently on a business trip which requires me to live from a hotel for a couple week at a time i'm ready to go back to keto and finally get under 200 i know it's possible i think i may just have to stay on keto forever otherwise i just eat eat eat keto kept my hunger in check i wa hoping that this summer i would be beach ready but i got knocked on my as my father died at 57 from a heart attack i have heart disease in my family i need to become healthier otherwise i won't last longer i'm just coming on here to vent and write down my thought and maybe get some encouragement that is something we can all use here is hoping i can get my goal of under 200 on the future tldr i tried keto with success the second time lost 75 lb but i got off keto and now i'm starting again

1,hopeless i have been keto for about 3 year now for some reason i won t stick to it for long period of time no matter what i do it feel like my life is constantly consumed with my eating disorder and trying to lose weight and i feel like i put in so much effort and it s never enough because i just end up binging again i have no friend really and nobody to go to to talk to i just want to be healthy i made a commitment to dairy free keto for the month of april and i ve already messed up and i just can t stop cry and wondering what s wrong with me it feel like i will never lose weight or be successful i just want to be healthy what is wrong with me cw 264 i m 5 8 23 yr 
1,a new perspective on a slice of cheese before keto i would skip the cheese when ordering a burger because i thought it wa healthier i wasn't really concerned about the extra calorie a much a i wa concerned about consuming extra saturated fat since the burger patty itself had plenty since learning about keto and ancel key i'm no longer concerned about consuming saturated fat so i have been having cheese with every burger and adding them to sandwich and wrap made with keto bread or low carb tortilla of course but now that i'm really getting down there in term of calorie consumed i realize that a single slice of cheese is now the difference between being at a 15 deficit v being at a 20 deficit i'm going to have to start cutting back to half a slice of cheese now grrr 
1,been on the keto diet for just over a month lost a stone and now want to find out how to safely come off the diet basically what s written a the title i have been on the keto diet since the end of february i have lost just around a stone since then and that s more than enough for me my question is how do i get off it safely without regaining the weight would it be okay to just jump off a i ve not been on it that long or will i need to gradually increase my carb intake over the next few week thank you so much for any help you can offer

1,question best desktop app to track 's of what i eat every day hi i checked many post but didn't find what i wa looking for i'm trying to find a desktop app that i can use to track the fat protein carb 's of the food i eat i know the of cal's i'm restricting myself to and i know the 's for keto i want to stick to but i'm having a heckin' time finding an app that will accurately calculate net carbs for example what i'm eating i have done a lot of reading on the keto diet so i feel like i'm at a great starting place i hardly ever eat out almost never eat pre made food stuff in a can box jar package and make almost everything from scratch i just can't seem to find accurate software that'll correctly calc net carbs and one where i can add my own recipe and have it calc net carbs and other 's accurately there's a lt i gt ton lt i gt of info out there it's so overwhelming if you can help point me in the right direction that'd be epic thanks 
1,anyone have issue with jimmy john's unwich i've been on keto for just over three week now i've lost 11 pound and lost a few inch a well i've kept it simple just making meat and low carb veggie maybe a little dairy etc i'm doing 16 8 if and tend to have to decent sized meal and a snack in the middle i stay right around 1500 cal and le than 20g carbs a day yesterday i decided i just wanted something a little different but wanted to keep it keto most of the place here are carb heavy fast food so i went with jimmy john's because they offer the unwich wrapped in lettuce no bread i got the tuna unwhich and added in avo cucumber bacon tomato provolone and hot pepper seemed like a decent idea at the time fast forward to around 6am this morning i woke up with a raging case of the flaming shit i weighed myself and i'd gained nearly three pound overnight i'm bloated crampy and feel fairly nauseous did this kick me out of ketosis maybe just a reaction to the hot pepper wa it their tuna mix itself i'm just not sure what i do know is lesson learned i do much better when i just stick to cooking my meat and veg at home 
1,don't forget to recalculate your macro a you lose weight so it occurred to me the other day that if i'm stalling a bit on weight loss maybe i should check my macro again that's when i realized i should enter my new and current weight not the weight i wa 30 pound ago and surprise surprise i need le of everything to maintain the same deficit this may be obvious to other people but i didn't even think about this until almost three month in and i don't recall seeing it in the faq i've gone from 290lb protein 133g fat 1800 calorie for a 27 deficit to 258lb 116 119 1616 for my current weight i should end up around 99 20 1400 near the end of my journey where i will slowly move up to my personal maintenance which according to the calculator just mean more fat and i plan to stay very low carb for the inflammation benefit 
1,how much weight do you usually lose in the first few day at the beginning of march i started dieting just taking an eat le move more approach it wa working pretty good my starting weight back then wa 337ibs and the lowest i got wa 330 2 but i settled in around 332 and could never really get below that with a little bit of frustration i broke my diet and decided if i'm going to start eating badly again start if so i've been doing if for a bout a week now last time i had weighed myself i shot up to 340 ibs so i thought i'd give that keto a try i've been on it for two day now and mostly been doing dirty keto basically getting fast food and ditching the bun and ketchup and staying below 2000 calorie for the last two day i wa shocked to see yesterday i wa 335 ibs and even more so this morning when i wa 332 ibs i'm sure most of it is just water weight and of course if i wa 100 ibs lighter the drop wouldn't be so drastic but is it common to see this sort of dramatic weight loss in the first couple of day day 1 i did a bodyweight routine my trainer sent me and went for a walk for about 30 minute but yesterday i don't think i broke 2 000 step on my tracker a an aside though i'm pretty okay with keto for the most part i've had some sleeping problem sparatic napping during the day yesterday couldn't sleep until 2 in the night but i've also read that reintroducing carbs too fast is bad and that it should be done over two week there's a video game i'm looking forward to in early may and while losing weight you sort of need to pick your battle that release weekend i'm going to enjoy myself within reason so i'm thinking of keeping my if a is and keeping calorie under 2000 ibs throughout april enjoy myself when my game is released then try to reintroduce keto throughout may i won't be doing dirty keto when i return though i don't have access to a kitchen with my current living situation but i think i can make a lot of meal work by just buying some pre cooked hardboiled egg and pre cooked bacon getting a rotisserie chicken some canned tuna and some thing like avocado and mayo on hand then when i start getting tired of that there's no saying i can't get a couple mcdoubles and ditch the bun 
1,raynauds disease hey guy doe anybody know what to do about raynauds i slowly started developing cold hand raynauds 2 5 year ago when i started taking cold shower and ice bath i sort of got addicted to it but i thought it wa healthy i took cold shower everyday for 10+ minute and i would take ice bath also 5 10 minute which is just insanity when i look back on it maybe 1 5 year ago i noticed how cold i felt when i wa at my house in school whatever i sort of knew that the cold shower wa causing but i still continued i stopped 6 month ago and haven't took a single cold shower since but now i live with constant cold hand at one point i started taking more pink salt magnesium and really saw improvement before i wa low salt no mg supplement so i definietely believe in the elctrolyte balance thing i just dont know what that balance would look like

1,am i out of ketosis i weigh myself each morning and i usually lose 1lb a day but this morning it came back the same a yesterday currently on day 6 am i out of ketosis filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler 
1,target hit but i want more hit my goal on 40kg loss im down at 93kg now really happy with the progress one thing i'm struggling to loose the tyre around my stomach at the moment everything else is starting to look defined again a i'm working out again but struggling with that and the love handle any advice guy and girl 
1,is it time to stop need heavy advice on multiple topic so i'm a firm believer in the keto diet feel free to skip this paragraph a it is backstory but is not needed gt i have always been thin in fact i often got complaint from family that i wa too thin that all changed when i moved to japan for study and i'm still studying starting uni next week i wa staying at a homestay and they would cook for me every day the meal were so big i managed to gain a few kilo now i went all my teen without knowing or caring about my weight so i have no point of reference other than my pant started to break often after that i started living alone and got thin again then the big scary hit u all and i started cooking more i took a look in the mirror and noticed that i no longer had that v thing around the lower ab area so i decided to check my weight it wa around 92 3kg 203 4lb i didn't think much of it until one day i weighed myself for the hell of it and it legitimately said 99 9kg 220lb the idea of ever reaching 100kg just never crossed my mind and i needed to get rid of the weight quick so i tried keto and effectively i lost 15kg 33lb in a few month then i stopped for a few month and went up to 86kg 190lb so i decided to do keto again lt amp x200b in the past two month of restarting the diet i lost 5kg down to about 81kg 178lb the first month according to a fitness geek friend of mine my ideal final weight would be around 77kg 170lb so i made that my final goal here is where i need your help i have been stuck going back and forth between 80kg and 81kg for a month now and it doesn't go lower than 80 6kg or higher than 81 2kg i make sure to always wear similar clothes and to always weigh myself in the morning right after waking up after using the bathroom if i need to i'm not overeating in fact i'm only eating one small and one regular meal a day and i'm definitely still in ketosis rarely ever going past 10g of carbs a day so what am i doing wrong i do have to say there is not much fat left in my body but there definitely still is is it time to stop and switch to a normal low calorie diet i did notice that it took longer to drop the initial 5kg than the first time i did the diet amp x200b now to problem number 2 i have severe adhd and take medication since recently quite strong one at that one of the side effect of the medication is dehydration it's bad enough outside the diet but on top on keto it's a nightmare i have a few concern because i've never mixed the two before now could my medication be affecting my diet and vice versa not medical advice just asking if it's a reason to stop the diet amp x200b if you read everything thank you so much and i'm looking forward to reading your advice this is genuinely stressing me out 
1,almost died today i think long story short i m on week 2 of keto been going great today i unfortunately cut myself washing dish and got stitch after 15 minute since the injury we were still cleaning the wound cause it kept bleeding everything wa turning white and cloudy hearing got muffled i swear i thought i wa going to die i blacked out for a few second and wa sweating like crazy once i came back color wasn t coming back yet so i had to scarf down some left over fry and taco my sister fortunately had just got home with ate the food amp drank gatorade zero on the way to the er and started to feel better i m assuming it wa cause of the low blood pressure that i fainted doctor said it wa most likely vasovagal regardless of being bother by blood or not it still happens but i don t think it wa that i mean sort of but i really thought i wa going to die like i said the color started changing and looking out the window it wa really white and cloudy i could barely even see my neighbor window when usually i could their entire house chimney fence and even the apartment complex on the other side of them my hearing wa practically gone i couldnt understand my family when they were trying to talk to me it all sounded very quiet and it didn t happen instantly this all happened with in a few minute i ve never heard of anyone taking their time to faint i don t really know the point of this not trying to bash keto it helped me a lot i broke the diet today and ate whatever i wanted without going overboard cause it really scared me i don t have a reliable source or guidance so i m just winging it over here i m really concerned about this diet with all the diabetes stuff i can t get answered to i only use source that support keto but all i get is people telling me don t listen to hater keto supporter isn t a hater or read the faq yeah i did and it s say the faq is not a doctor so do it at my own risk again i m not trying to bash but i guess i m just really sad now i might have to give up keto i lost 14lbs so i m proud of that doctor said it s fine to keep going but didn t really go into all they were trying to do is get me in and out of there so can anyone recommend a safer diet for me 
1,ever had problem with konjac noodle apparently they can cause intestinal blockage so ha anyone that eats it regularly had an issue not necessarily a blockage but gi discomfort i miss ramen and think i need a touch more fibre in my diet 
1,keto causing sleep issue it took me a long time to make the connection but any time i'm in keto my sleep get affected when i fall off the wagon and eat carbs i sleep like a baby after a day or two i only really noticed it because i haven't been very strict this past year and have dipped in and out making it more noticeable but it's always been a problem what i mean is that i don't really have trouble falling asleep but i'll wake up two or three time a night and will only sleep for about 6 hour versus my usual 8 or 9 it doesn't feel deep sleep and is kinda similar to that false sleep you can get from some sleeping pill where it feel more like you just had your eye closed for 8 hour interestingly i don't really feel tired during the day with le sleep on keto but i don't wake feeling particularly rested i don't have any sleep issue normally anyone else have this problem and found a solution any insight are appreciated 
1,question about powdered drink mix and an analysis on maltodextrin so i'm totally familiar with maltodextrin and how bad it is on keto my question is regarding the amount of kool aid i make sweetened with pure sucralose powder the idea of using the powder because of the maltodextrin ha been vilified a ton it seems when i talk to people so i'm just asking here for clarification for the blue raspberry lemonade kool aid http i5 walmartimages com asr 2c726085 4fab 4745 88fe 0f8145f6c860 93bc05d0c57f82606b4315ee6dbe3e0f jpeg i noticed maltodextrin is after sodium so each serving ha 10mg minimum of maltodextrin because there's 10mg of sodium in each serving preceding maltodextrin is calcium phosphate and if you look at the calcium at the bottom it say it provides 2 of the daily rda under the rda's guideline for calcium it say that 1300mg should be taken in daily 2 of this 1300mg rda 26mg so if we assume there's 25mg of maltodextrin in each serving that would make 125mg per packet right so a gallon 2packets 250mg of maltodextrin even if i were to drink two gallon a day that'd leave me at 500mg or half a gram of maltodextrin or half a carb a day form kool aid right is the ill response to these powder accurate because i'm missing something i feel like i'm not understanding a specific concept or guesstimating the right amount of ingredient i mean the cherry variety http image na ssl image amazon com image i 919gey0cqjl _sl1500_ jpg doesn't even have maltodextrin in it i originally got into this because it wa suggested insulin resistance because of thing like the koolaid i make is the culprit of why the last of my lower stomach feel like it been in the pre whoosh stage for 2 month now and ha what feel like the consistency of a water bed and extremely squishy super sorry about the wall of text i've been on a very intense cut for the last 5 month and my macro are basically forcing me to do keto a of the moment so i'm just looking for answer any input is super appreciated 
1,exited keto last night too much dry skin and keto rash will try again later tbh i ve been on and off keto for the last couple of year and just last night it dawned on me the reason i get red scaly patch on my face and dry dull skin ha been due to keto or keto rash i couldn t understand why eating a healthy keto diet full of fresh vegetable and lean meat along with lot of exercise and water 2 3l a day would cause my skin to get worse today i m feeling much better and my skin is already healing after eating a can of kidney bean and an apple this morning i can feel the moisture ha returned when i touch my face i do miss the suppressed appetite and wired energy of keto though so i m hoping to get back on it in a few month of trying a low calorie diet but i wonder what i can do better next time i wa already taking salt and magnesium supplement but that didn t help get rid of keto rash last year on keto i wa using the potassium salt but still had the same issue maybe keto rash is unavoidable 
1,keto ha blown my mind i ve had never tried keto before but after a particularly bad blood sugar result my dr advised to start keto in 18 day i ve lost 14lb but the most amazing thing that i have never experienced in the past is that i am not hungry prior to keto all i would do wa thing about food i ve done weight watcher slimming world noom etc and the common thread wa that i wa hungry constantly sometimes to the point that i couldn t sleep i used to end up sneaking downstairs to secret eat but now nothing no hunger no obsessing about food it s an absolute revelation i wish i d known about this earlier

1,4 kg in a 10 day any help i'm not very familiar with the keto diet but i've noticed that there are a couple of people who may be in a similar situation a me i won't go into much detail i'll explain in brief due to the diagnosis of gastritis and gerd in the last 10 day i have completely changed my diet no more junk food no more sweet or soda or alcoholic drink i lost about 4 kg in 10 day so i wa a little worried because i have stool problem brown yellow green and i read that it could be something related to the pancreas my doctor think it's from a change in diet also the ultrasound didn't help much considering i wa told my pancreas wa poorly visualized i wonder if i should worry or i don't feel exhausted or lack strength i feel good considering i've been sleeping for 3 4 hour for a while due to some obligation thanks btw also this morning on an empty stomach i weighed in at 115 5 and a soon a i drink 2 3 cup of water it went to 116 7 
1,the effect sleep can have hello all just wanted a place to put this out there long story short been keto before and successfully lost 30 lb had a baby and gained it all back and then some i ve been off and on since a couple month post partum and have just been too stressed overwhelmed exhausted for it to stick little one is almost 10 month and although teething is killing u right now we re in a decent spot given this i hopped back on this past monday and have been successful again lost about 5 lb feeling in control with only a few hard moment that i ultimately defeated however in one night i gained 3 lb and i believe this is due to lack of sleep i fasted until lunch wa within macro barely over calorie wa done eating by 6 45 and had a good 40 minute walk when all of those thing line up i can expect to lose something based on all of my experience even if it s 5 lb it s something well i gained 3 2 lb and i can guarantee you it s because i slept on the couch last night and got just about zero sleep my baby girl had a rough night and when that s the case and my husband is home he work night i will go to the couch this is because he s up most of the night because his own sleep is completely jacked due to work and he can t stand to hear her cry to honestly make it easier for everyone i go to the living room and close the door so he can t hear her and i don t feel pressure to go against the sleep training i ve successfully done with her most of the time i don t have that much trouble getting some sleep but last night i just couldn t get right maybe some other factor contributed to the gain but i believe this to be the biggest factor it s crazy how it can effect it so greatly my husband is back at work tonight i ll be back in bed and hopefully baby ha a better night for a happier scale in the morning haha

1,3 month update 52 4 lb lost after year of being big i got tired of my foot hurting all the time figured my weight had some role in that so i started looking into keto after a niece had some success with it i have a job that keep me in the car most of the day and wa eating fast food almost every day i had no idea my current weight because my wife's bathroom scale wouldn't go that high wa guessing i wa around 325 330 started researching the diet read the faq tried a few recipe and ordered a new scale it arrived on the evening of 12 28 i weighed myself after dinner i know and wa surprised to see i wa 350 6 lb yes i needed to lose weight i officially started keto on 1 1 21 at 343 4lbs i initially bought way too much food because i wasn't yet sure how much i'd eat on a given day i know the recommendation is to do a 20 deficit but i went with 35 and have maintained that throughout that give me a low fat macro and about 1500 calorie per day now that's a big step down from before when i'd sometimes have 4000 calorie in one meal i'm not kidding i started with simple meal eventually tried a few recipe some i liked and some i didn't i've now gotten into a pretty good routine and vary my dinner through different meat and veggie while keeping brunch about the same each day i've had a few week long stall along the way i don't eat out hardly at all anymore and when i do it usually lead to a slight weight gain despite reading menu nutrition chart and keeping my number down after one fairly long stall i decided to try a fast only water 11pm sunday to 2pm tuesday and that helped a lot to get it started again on 4 1 i weighed 291 lb no april fool there if i can keep up the 15 lb mo loss rate then i'll be at my initial goal of 210 by halloween according to the height weight chart my ideal weight is about 180 lb not sure if that's doable or desired but i'll decide when i get close to the first goal for a long time i made excuse that dieting cost too much because healthy food cost more than unhealthy food and i'm not wealthy it's cheaper to buy a pack of hot dog and a box of mac n cheese than broccoli and chicken well that's true but i've found i have more money in the bank now than i did then i might go spend 150 at the grocery store usually le but then i feed myself two meal per day for two week or more compare that to a 15 or more every day in the drive thru for one meal in the same timeframe at 210+ i've finally convinced my wife to try it a she's been wanting to lose some weight 5'0 at 127 lb and she started on 4 1 at a 20 deficit she committed to 30 under 20 for now then she'll decide if she want to continue she's a big bread chocolate and milk fan so i'm finding some sub for her anyhoo i'm pleased with the progress so far i've gone down 2 pant size and am close to going down another had to buy a new belt my seatbelt isn't a tight a it used to be and my foot still hurt some but not a bad or a often a before

1,nsv keto had changed my relationship with food for better so back at the end of february i m 23 6'0 started keto cold turkey i started at 265 pound eating probably close to 3000 calorie a day if not more even back in my college athletics day i wa a rower for a d1 club team my relationship with food to put it lightly wa a coping mechanism feeling sad eat feeling depressed eat bored eat it wasn't healthy and i knew i needed to change something so after doing a lot of research i determined keto wa the best fit for me and even though it's recommended to slowly transition in i just went full in i count my macro and weigh food out and at the beginning it wa hard fighting the urge to cheat but i didn't give in and a time went on the craving went away i started walking more and just getting outside in general and after over a month i realized something i don't need to eat to feel better or just because i'm bored i need to eat when i'm hungry to live and yea i can snack from time to time but food is for sustenance not something to pas the time and in that epiphany i realized why keto work for me it cut out my craving and made me feel fuller longer it made me genuinely take stock of what i eat and get smarter about what i'm putting in my body my goal is 200 and a of today i'm down to 238 but what impress me the most is not that weight loss it's that keto ha made my relationship with food into a healthy one i may not stay on keto forever probably going to carb cycling but the lesson keto is teaching me now are going to last me the rest of my life and i'll be better off for it

1,what are your go to recommended keto brand amp product a someone who did this diet a few year ago and is now coming back to it i am amazed at how many new keto friendly product are available these day i would like to compile a list of go to product please share what your favorite keto product are these don't have to specifically be keto branded product but anything you regularly buy from the grocery store amp x200b some of my favorite and their net carbs per serving in parenthesis pasta sauce rao's homemade marinara sauce 5g better than most sugary sauce imo milk kroger carbmaster ultra filtered non fat original milk 3g i don't like the taste of nut milk and so drink this instead every so often chocolate lily's milk chocolate style salted caramel bar 2g i recommend this whole brand but i enjoy this product specifically sandwich bread outer aisle cauliflower sandwich thins 2g this is not bread but it great for when you want to make a sandwich can be used for mini pizza a well ice cream net carbs vary by flavor i've tried halo top enlightened rebel and other le known brand i'd say rebel is the best followed by enlightened followed by halo top halo top to me is more creamed ice than ice cream this is somewhat of a problem with all these brand but i'd say halo top ha the worst texture overall enlightened and rebel are both pretty good i gave the edge to rebel due to flavor choice being more to my liking i am actually going to try making my own ice cream soon which i'm sure will be better than all of these option still these are good to know for when you're lazy frozen product costco frozen broccoli 2g package come with 4 or so smaller bag of broccoli nuke the bag for 5 minute and season how you like and you have some really good broccoli on demand amp x200b i will add more to this list tomorrow amp maybe ongoing but i'm tired and wanted to get the thread started 
1,are my expectation reasonable i started tuesday and i ve gained a pound so far i weighed myself an hour or so after i ate today which wasn t the smartest i m also tmi alert on the first day of my period so that could make it even more inaccurate i know you should really only weigh yourself once a week and in the morning after you ve been to the restroom but sometimes i get the urge just to weigh myself i m 5 5f and i weigh 263lbs yikes and i plan on losing 100 120lbs or so i m also doing if 16 8 so i m only eating 12pm 8pm and i m hoping with both combined i can lose the weight within 8months year i ve also been doing light exercise treadmill incline 5 speed 2 5 amp quad amp glute amp one day i did do arm minus today since mother nature came to visit i don t want to get discouraged so fast and have unrealistic expectation i know some people lose 10lbs of water weight their first week but i m scared i won t really lose any although my intake is 70 76 fat 4 6 carbs amp 18 22 protein i ve seen a story where someone lost 100lbs in 4 month which doesn t seem healthy but definitely sound nicer than waiting a year or so if i could lose the weight in 6 month that would be amazing but unrealistic i m eating no more than 1800 calorie so far i ve been staying around the 1500 mark although today i only had around 855 calorie i don t feel hungry i think a combination of my bloating and i believe i m starting to come down with a slight cold have been the reason for my appetite loss but i think 1800 is a good max especially if i m staying around 1500 already i m just new to keto so i m kind of concerned about my result 
1,question hamburger hello following the information here i ended up losing 100ibs but i had a question i wanted to reenter ketosis instead of the individual meal i did when i first started would it be possible if i just maintained a diet of burger patty to renter ketosis in 2 4 day i need to lose 20 28 pound to reach my goal 
1,random glucose insulin blood test nsv i have been working with a weight management doctor and after losing 45lbs in about 5 month sw 257 cw 213 he ordered a series of blood test to check on how i wa doing with keto and in term of health the main reason for wanting to lose the nsv i have to share is that my random glucose test came back a 1 microunit per milliliter this test measure the amount of insulin in the body the normal range for this test is largely debated but clearly i am nice and low and keto is working suggesting true lipolysis breakdown of stored fat 
1,i did the egg fast to restart my keto journey last week let me preface with i know it s not really a fast i did this to restart keto after several month of falling off and getting back on the wagon i struggle with meal planning i like egg well enough and this wa just easy i ate nothing but egg and fat for three day i either scrambled egg in a tablespoon of butter for each egg or ate a tablespoon of mct oil for every poached or fried or boiled egg i wasn t able to do the full six egg and six tablespoon of fat daily i usually maxed out at four each i had a bit of babybel cheese on the side to have texture day two i mistrusted a fart but it wa just a poot day three my butthole got fried by all the liquid coming through it repeatedly disgustingly it wa yellowish and smelled a bit like egg i lost 7 5 lb water weight most likely but now can t even think about egg for awhile without feeling queasy next time i feel the need to do something like this i ll probably just regular fast instead 
1,i've got 80kg 175lbs to lose ha anyone here lost that much i'm 15kg into my journey and this month my weight plateaued for the first time for 30 day and to be honest it's scared the hell out of me in the support group i'm in outside reddit it feel like i have more to lose than anyone else everyone else seems to have so much le to lose most want to lose up to 30 45kg 66 100lbs and their advice experience is often so different to mine and doesn't help me a much a i'd like because someone of my size ha different issue physically mentally emotionally to face it's extremely difficult to explain the difference to them because they just aren't this big and it's usually very small difference so they brush it off a insignificant it's not to me and that make me feel very alienated so i really could use some exposure to first hand experience and reassurance from people who've lost at least 70kg 150lbs if that's you it would mean a lot if you could talk to me and answer some of my question amp x200b 1 how much did you lose and how long did it take you what type of keto dirty strict lazy clean and wa it only keto or did you do other thing to help along the way 2 how ha maintenance been if you're there did you transition to another way of eating did thing get harder a you approached your goal weight 3 do you work out when did you decide to start working out and for what reason 4 when did you start noticing you were actually getting smaller specifically in the belly region which is so far the least changed part of me measurement wise 5 is there anything you wished you knew when you started that would have made thing easier for you to lose weight or keep it off 6 what wa your biggest struggle how did you face plateau and day where you just felt like it wa impossible to get to be your goal i don't often struggle with this but when i do it's very hard because i don't know many people who have this much to loose so i can't look to them and say they did it i can too 7 did you have insulin resistance and if so did it clear up or are you still watchful is there anything health wise i should be watchful for while losing weight i've already lost my gallbladder due to disease long ago and i'm trying to ensure that i'm losing fat not muscle but if you have tip for that i'd appreciate them you might know something i don't

1,a week in on keto is it ok to fill in protein with a can of tuna so i decided to go keto so far i feel fantastic intensely limiting carbs and focusing on protein seems to have been the missing link in my life for the past decade at 30 i feel better than i ever did at 20 ahem anyway i've normally been eating bacon and egg mixed with cheddar cheese and a 5 oz can of tuna for breakfast and boneless skinless chicken breast for dinner with broccoli i'm doing lazy keto to start just to kind of see what happens however the combination of what is above get me right near my protein goal mainly helped due to the chicken breast however today i got sick of chicken and made something else instead with ground beef this of course ha lowered my protein intake so my question is i'm really full but of course i don't want to let myself go below my protein goal is it ok to fill in what protein is left with another 5 oz can of tuna i really love tuna and i buy half of my can in oil for the fat and half in water for just this occasion but i guess it just feel kinda weird to keep on eating is the tuna an ok way to fill it in or is it better to go a different route thank you

1,wa on keto for a month but did not lose any weight wa i doing something wrong so since march i've been on or at least tried to be on a keto diet my house is a typical asian household where carbs are everywhere and is the main source of energy here so i didn't have a lot of keto friendly choice i've been counting my daily carb intake and to be safe kept it under 20 gram everyday but i'd have some snack at night which i still counted but i didn't think much of it there'd be some day where i'd be like ah fuck it ill just go under 30 and ate some food with some carbs but still trying to count it and make sure i wasn't going over prior to this diet i have tried countless time going keto but failing to maintain the diet within the first week but this time i really tried it since the first time i did it i wa on it for a month and lost at least 20 pound but this time it didn't work i weighed myself at 220 at the start and at the end only weighed in about 218 there were some time where i didn't know the carb count of some food and i just ate it hoping it did not knock me off keto like at the last week i ate a dozen wing which had some breading on it i don't know keto stopped working for me co of the many time i've tried to be on it and didn't maintain it or i've just been eating the wrong food at the wrong amount and at the wrong time i've done my research and the next time i try a keto diet i will go on a calorie deficit with intermittent fasting i'm really tryna cut down before the middle of the year any tip 
1,lost over 100lbs on keto next step surgury hey everyone well i 33 f 164cm sw 300lbs cw 175lbs have been on keto since february of 2019 i started at around 300lbs and i have been slowly working my way down i think i may be the only person i know who didn't gain weight during the strict quarantine here but i didn't lose much during those month either to be fair i have been going pretty slow in the last 5 or so month i added in intermittent fasting but generally speaking i just lose weight slowly and i am ok with that i have always weighed a lot when i am stick thin i weigh 165 pound i mean i am happy to lose another 10 pound give or take but i am not fussed about it i am happy with my body where i am at i had sort of hoped that losing so slowly and using ample cream and i mean seriously i could not be more effing hydrated would aid in not having so much loose skin and maybe it did but not enough my loose skin is an actual problem this is going to be so much tmi but we're all in the same boat here right my loose skin is a hygiene problem a we're getting into the warmer month here i am struggling to keep under the flap of skin dry like we re one hot month away from there being a smell situation my belly button is already questionable i don t know how to talk about this with people i know so i turned to the internet like everyone else doe i'd like to think that if it were just an aesthetic thing i would be happier with the situation but i am honestly not sure how long i would be willing to play tetri with skin to put on clothes before i considered surgery even without the present hygiene issue i know many people who lost more weight than i did and didn t end up with a much i suppose everyone is different i'm not unhappy with my body per se but it's hard to be super excited about losing 100 pound and buying your first bikini when you have to do a puzzle of how to place your skin inside it every time but i want to know ha anyone here considered surgery have you gotten it what should i expect what are some thing you re curious about if you haven t had it or if you ve had it what thing do you wish you had known beforehand

1,weird nsv i fainted an sv and a good nsv two day ago i fainted weird nsv after working out which normally would be concerning but i had just weighed myself right before showering and wa trying to get a non compromising photo of my scale which i have learned is unnecessarily reflective because i am finally back in the 250s that's the sv and 259 4 count a 250s and today wa 258 2 for the first time in a couple year for the fist time in 5 year i stood up way too fast felt dizzy and wa suddenly knocking over the towel rack bruising my knee and lying on the floor thinking i wa having a stroke after standing back up and checking that both half of my face were still mobile i realized i had fainted and that it might be time to check on my blood pressure med to see about lowering them so today i saw my dr and we're starting to reduce the med the good nsv with the goal of eliminating them in the near future because i keep getting reading of 100 60 the last few week while i wa there we discussed that i'm on keto she wa fine with it but not a huge fan but didn't cast any shade on it we're checking my a1c cholesterol the regular panel liver and kidney function and i'm pretty sure potassium too will update in a couple day with how those turn out also i wore pant to the doctor that i bought over a year ago that were my size but which i couldn't get on and now they fit great one of my bp med is lisinopril which is known to raise blood potassium level so i've been reluctant to add it to my diet tl dr passed out because my blood pressure is running low due to weight loss and now i get to lower my med and in a few month probably get off them completely

1,would drinking a lot of water after eating carbs reduce the chance of breaking ketosis example drinking a glass of juice and than drinking 3 glass of water would the extra water dilute the juice enough or maybe something like 2 slice of pizza and than chug a bunch of water is it possible to work

1,omad question so i m thinking of trying omad i ve done if 16 8 and even a couple 36 hour fast for omad do you just have one huge meal all your calorie carbs protein in one sitting seems like a huge meal to eat at one time 
1,see below started on 29th of march have i entered ketosis if so when do i start to lose weight rlly not sure about this since it take 2 7 day it s definitely possible but i m not sure my fatigue only lasted a day unless you count feeling more tired than usual before bed usually fell asleep at 2 00 am fell asleep at like 1 00 or midnight i m not sure if i have broken my fast or my system ha hopefully gone into ketosis 
1,question about electrolyte dehydration etc i have been on keto now for only two day but i felt ketosis coming very quickly mental energy is at the top physical energy varies depending on factor since i started omad at the same time a keto i rarely ever have any energy when trying to work out but i realize that my body just need to adapt overall i feel great but a few thing worry me first of all i experience muscle cramp and somewhat of a headache unless i drink salt water every two hour i bought some electrolyte powder a well with sodium magnesium potassium and sodium i feel really great after taking that stuff and i feel like i need to take it probably 3 time per day and i wouldn't say that i'm really that active right now i know that you urinate a lot on keto and electrolyte imbalance are a pretty common thing but my question is 1 do i need to replenish these amount of electrolyte all the time when i'm on keto or doe my body kind of adapt to it after a few week i know it doesn't really work that way but i figure the body must find a system to kind of keep thing in need and not flush it right i mean i must take a lot of electrolyte just to try to prevent my muscle from twitching and my joint from hurting and getting stiff 2 doe the diarrhoea subside when my body get fat adapted at least yesterday i had to shit water at least 3 time after my meal i realize that it's a common side effect during the initial stage of ketosis or during keto flu but the body adapts to it right i've got some probiotic pill at home which only usually make me need to shit more and not necessarily make it better but i can try those i ate some saurkraut today with my meal and i hope that it make some difference i think there were some undigested piece today too yellow dark yellow piece circa 0 5 cm 0 2 3 what are the general symptom of being dehydrated except for being thirsty can dehydration cause muscle twitch too etc 4 how long time doe it take before i can get a little bit of physical energy to work out i must be very careful right now a little too much and i just get generally drained i don't think working out really is a good idea right now since i might have muscle catabolism if i do so 5 is a high conjugated bilirubin level bad in combination with keto i saw on my recent blood test that i had a pretty high conjugated bilirubin level all the other liver enzyme level etc were all fine but is this worry me slightly since the liver is part of what metabolizes fat or the primary part in the process i figure that i feel fine in general at least mentally and no real abnormal colour of urine or stool so i should be fine right 
1,severe crohn's amp autoimmune disorder are these food enough for keto a a preface i have a rare form of crohn's orofacialgranulomatosis or ofg for short it's teetering on the edge of developing into bowel crohn's but the condition inevitably develops regardless unless keto can stop this i also suffer from asthma hayfever coffee caffeine allergy and various other immune related illness i did keto for 6 month straight a couple of year back felt great but then relapsed due to the food i wa eating on keto conflicting with crohn's all that changed when a suspected heart attack i wa only 27 turned out to be severe heart inflammation caused by the mature cheese and cured meat i wa using a snack after that i've been eating clean meat dairy fat leafy green etc but constantly been in and out of illness fever etc long story short i've found the root of the problem year late coffee it ha seriously been messing me up to the point where i developed a fistula the dreaded beginning of crohn's it still hasn't been fixed after 2 year although the pandemic didn't help my question is am i able to live healthily on keto if my diet consists of meat leafy green like broccoli butter and pepper onion asparagus for flavouring i can add macadamia nut in too for a snack a they are well tolerated i have ketoaide supplemented to make up the minor shortcoming when it come to electrolyte too and the food itself is well salted each day ha around 100g of butter total added to meal in addition to using fatty meat such a chicken thigh and beef shin it's also the only way i can add variety by switching meat sorry for the long post but if i eat this way in addition to keeping on top of electrolyte and supplement i should be fine right symptom of my illness have reduced significantly since switching to clean fresh food and avoiding fermented product such a coffee and cured meat i just want to make sure i won't be killing myself by eating like this thank you in advance lovely people

1,update plus face gain update http imgur com gallery wroscxf journey so far i started keto on 12 2019 i wa 326 lb and noticed my quality of life wa poor i went to a dr who doe medically supervised weight loss and i knew if i followed his instruction i would have success i already knew lot about it but he taught me all about the keto diet and told me to follow the carb protein fat number he set for me and gave me basically a large faq folder to take with me for the first couple month i saw him every two week with weigh in that provided a printout of my progress with nifty little graph and all we would talk about what kind of thing i wa eating how i wa feeling etc and would be a coach counselor cheerleader once i wa adapted to the lifestyle we moved to 3 week between appointment i looked forward to my time with him and tried to avoid weighing myself outside of his office so it felt like a treat to see my new number once i had lost a good amount of weight and my energy wa high he got me to start working out i got a gym membership and wa going 3 4 day a week i loved my gym day and wa shocked that it had taken me so long to go everything wa going perfect then covid i wa actually at the gym when i got the text that they would be closing indefinitely in a few hour no biggie i went to the store on my way home to buy resistance band medicine ball among other thing to work out in my garage i got everything set up and never used it once going to my garage to work out didn t have the same feel of going to the gym and i just couldn t do it it s ok though i ll just stick to the diet by this time no in person dr appointment allowed so i could no longer weigh in and get my cool graph i tried zoom style appointment but it wasn t the same i kept eating keto and on april 30 2020 i wa 262 lb 64 pound lost in le than 5 month incredible well that wa the lowest number i would see on the scale i slowly started cheating here and there mostly for comfort in this crazy new world we were in before long i wa 100 off keto for a long time i stayed pretty close to my lowest weight i had learned about portion control only eating when i needed to and stopping when my body told me to eventually i fell back into over eating eating for fun and comfort and to satiate boredom pound started rising and me new clothes got tight i didn t step on a scale for a long time 1 1 2021 i stepped on a scale 312 i wa so upset and disappointed i promised myself i would never go back to where i started the next morning i wa 100 keto i dropped down to 295 quick and stayed there for about 3 week what wa i doing wrong i soon realized i wa using all the keto low carb product from the grocery store i cut those all out and went back to basic meat cheese egg avocado cauliflower brussels sprout that s it only thing i will put in my body today i am 272 and 10 lb away from my first goal of getting back to where i wa a year ago i am hoping to hit my goal of 262 by april 30 the date i hit 262 last year i just want to end by saying thank you to everyone who share their story here i read them often and you all give me ton of motivation sorry for the long post but it s been a long journey so far have a great day and thanks for listening 
1,anyone tried ice cream from killer creamery my local grocery store just started carrying this brand they use allulose which seems to be generating a good bit of buzz because of it property for the ketogenic lifestyle the nutrition label are a little more confusing a allulose seems to be counted a a carb in the label but it is not a sugar alcohol so it's not listed under sugar alcohol in the nutrition label but i think they are supposed to be about 2 g net carbs subtracting out the allulose which put them on par with rebel from a nutritional perspective 
1,is my scale broken a short backstory i m bigger so weighing myself ha never been high on my to do list the last time i knew my weight wa when i went to the doctor for a checkup about 6 month ago i started keto 6 week ago and i m loving it so far when i started i did not intend on using my scale since i figured my goal would be drop a shirt pant size rather than number but i ve been feeling so good that i decided to break out the scale about a month in i wa down 30 pound from my last known weight and i ve been weighing every week and now i m down 44 pound according to my scale but my clothes still basically fit the same the pant are a little looser but that s it is this normal should i try a different scale fyi sw 400 cw 356 gw 250 lt 20 carbs day 
1,exactly 3 month in i have lost 20lbs and i have repatriated in onderland i am below 200lbs for the first time in 22 year the last 10 day have been especially amazing for me i am so excited to see strong progress lately a i mentioned in my 3 month in well just short of 3 month first post http www reddit com r keto comment mce27a my_keto_journey_thus_far_3_months_in_long in r keto i had experienced pretty strong progress though with some period of frustrating though expected per the faq slow loss i recently realized however that i wa probably sabotaging my progress somewhat despite being fairly strict and tracking my intake somewhat regularly i wa eating unaccounted for nut and breaking my intermittent fasting with late night scotch double whammy calorie + the interrupted if needle to say i wasn't adding those nut or drink to my log in mfp starting on 3 21 i started tracking every nut in addition to everything else i'm eating and stopped drinking a much and definitely no more if busting drink the nut tracking isn't a bad a it sound using my scale i know that 2 toasted pecan is about 5g and 2 almond is about 2g so it's fairly easy to track that in mfp in my head now without the scale coincidence or not you can see a marked improvement in the rate of loss since 3 21 really kicking in on 3 26 where the weight started falling off the only thing i really changed wa what i mentioned above that's almost 5lbs in the 10 day since 3 25 my caloric intake is lower since 3 21 overall but i'm still hitting my protein macro of about 120g day thanks to r keto it's great to see everyone else's struggle and triumph and posting help me stay accountable to myself imgur http i imgur com tnebw6y png http i imgur com tnebw6y png see the last 33 day imgur http i imgur com 7zjjbnp png http i imgur com 7zjjbnp png see the full 3 month progress i would say on average prior to 3 21 you could add 100 300 calorie a day of untracked booze and nut

1,keto amp exercise hi like many others i've been doing pretty much zero exercise throughout the lockdown and currently sticking to the below macro fat amp protein 115 125g usually around 63 fat and 28 protein carbs 15g 20g kcal 1600 my bmr is 1727 i'm 187lb 36 year old 182cm i'm now looking at introducing quite heavy exercise three time a week likely burning between 800 and 1200 calorie each time the obvious principle would be to eat more calorie on my exercise day but is this necessary it would be difficult to take onboard those additional calorie whilst staying in my macro and not completely changing my meal plan a my calorie deficit is relatively small a it is should i just continue a is thanks in advance ryan 
1,carbs that aren't fiber or sugar sometimes i'll notice carbs listed that even after subtracting sugar alcohol and fiber are super high from what i've read these are polysaccharide i think is this just natural carbs in certain food i've been avoiding anything like that and did last time i wa on keto a well but just am very curious about it thanks

1,keto peep im getting disillusioned it been a whole month and no weight loss and my reading say not in ketosis i started my keto journey for the third time ever on january 8th since then i lost a whole 15lbs i decided to get a keto mojo and my reading have been a whopping 4 every time for the last 4 week so i think the potential lack of ketosis explains my stall in weight loss maybe it the higher protein intake i know i should probably be exercising more too i also got blood work done a month ago and the doctor wa very concerned for 200+ level of ldl all of this said i'm really not feeling like all the effort i've been putting into this diet is worth it i'm just bummed out thought i'd reach out here for a bump in motivation

1,question about red wine so i m limited to 22g of carbs a day on my plan but i notice my wine withdrawal wait doe that mean alcoholic kidding so i just thought i d look up a glass of a bottle i have and it say only 4g of carbs so is one 4oz glass going to mess with my plan or delay it wondering what i m missing thanks in advance

1,artificially flavored coffee is it keto hello r keto i just had a quick question i bought a box of artificially flavored french vanilla keurig pod from my local grocery store and saw that they had no calorie carbs or any nutritional information on the box however could the artificial flavor in the coffee possibly knock me out of ketosis i've been drinking it black and have added no sugar or artificial sweetener to it 
1,thinking about going off of keto i m a 17m and been doing keto for almost 4 month now i never really did it for weight loss i mostly found the cognitive benefit to be the real factor the last few week my craving have gone up i m not building a much muscle a i would like i lift very consistently and i still want to drink my bulletproof coffee every morning if i can drink my bulletproof every morning a my breakfast and still do intermittent fasting without gaining any weight then i think i ll start eating carbs again basically what i m asking is can i still drink bulletproof if i m eating carbs i ll still do intermittent fasting and the bulletproof will be my only food until lunch time i just don t want to risk gaining a lot of weight while i want more muscle i m overall very happy with my body right now anyone have advice or in a similar situation it seems hard to find info on this thanks 
1,life after keto i've done low carb diet in the past where i've gone into ketosis and lost a bunch of weight i then regained the weight because i started eating normally again without slowly reintroducing carbs i am 7 month post partum and am thinking of doing super low carb again to get into ketosis my question is doe keto have to be a way of life or can i do it a a diet for a while to lose weight then slowly increase my carb intake 
1,egg intolerance i wa on my last day of a cleansing carnivore diet the past two day i have been bloated and felt nauseous it is a sad day cause i love egg it is a staple of my ketogenic diet look like i m gonna have to start incorporating new recipe into my daily life anyone else developed this problem 
1,anybody tired of these asshole that claim to know all the answer some of these people who play amateur psychologist that get real personal with those that are talking about their struggle with weight loss are fucking loser you know the pull up your bootstrap type to most of them it s not about helping people it s a chance to say i m better than you people have weight problem stemming from all sort of reason you can t have a one size fit all answer to all their different problem i m not saying some people don t need a kick in the as sometimes but a lot of people get too judgmental and get off on telling people they re faller before you give some one that pep talk that they re not trying hard enough or not making their health a priority you should be cognizant that it s more difficult for some people than other so a lot of these preachy motherfucker need to get off their high horse if motivation is what someone need they more than likely aren t going to get it from some asshole on reddit

1,my special bullet proof coffee v pasture raised egg what's healthier i used to do bullet proof coffee every single day when i started doing the keto diet i felt great after drinking it it helped keep me full for a long time and wa incredibly convenient however i wa told by a few fellow keto people that while it wa a good way to get in protein and fat it wasn't optimal nutrition so i started doing 3 pasture raised egg 1 sausage and a few mushroom for my breakfast 5 7 day a week and eating some liver and onion on the weekend i absolutely love eating egg every day and they are my favorite food plus local pasture raised egg are basically multi vitamin however i just don't think i have enough time anymore in the morning to cook this semi involved breakfast clean the pan clean the cutting board knife and then eat everything it take way more time to make than a bullet proof coffee so i want to switch back to doing that every day and eating liver or egg on the weekend when i have more time do you guy think that bullet proof coffee 5 time per week will make me miss out on a lot of nutrition even if i am eating liver egg on the weekend do you have any advice on how to load more nutrient into my bullet proof coffee gt for more context special bullet proof coffee recipe i like to call it 50 caliber coffee try to load it with a much goodness a possible so it not just empty calorie 1 2 tsp turmeric 1 2 tsp cinnamon 1 2 tsp of green vein kratom 1 5 cup of coffee or black tea 1 dab of shilajit http www cintamanitonics com product page shilajit 1 scoop of whey protein 1 tbsp ghee 1 tbsp mct oil 1 2 tbsp avocado oil 1 tbsp heavy cream lunch is usually some fatty cut of pork or beef along with some vegetable kale chard mushroom or cabbage dinner is either a bone broth with cream and mushroom leek or ricotta cheese with peanut butter hemp heart casein protein heavy cream and walnut

1,one derland i'd like to share some exciting progress with the group here after a couple week self imposed plateau i've wandered into one derland i discovered the fasting subreddit my first 42 hour fast broke my plateau and helped teach me to eat slowly and smaller i also incorporated 9000 step per day at this time this pushed my weight from 210 205 recently i started a journey based entirely in lunacy i wa inspired by the folk at r fasting to begin a 7 day fast i'm on day 4 although it ha been a bit dirty i've had 3 drink over those 90 hour but otherwise very successful i've ramped my walking effort up from 9000 step to the 10k 15k range but i won't be sustaining that over a longer period of time i dropped from 205 6 at the start of the fast to 198 8 this morning i know much of that is water weight which is puzzling since i've been pretty good about being keto for 2 month but it felt amazing to step on the scale and see a 1 in the hundred digit i'm hoping that in the following 3 5 day i can lose enough mass to stay in the 190s after breaking fast i'm posting this here because frankly i couldn't dream of getting nearly 4 day into a fast without keto given the voracious hunger i would have broke on day 1 day 2 at best overall i've lost about 25 pound in 2 and a half month my prediction for onderland wa the first week of april and i seem to have beaten that mark by one day on to the next goal i'm shooting to lose the next 25 pound over 3 month 
1,ketosis while fasting good everyone i hope everyone is doing well thus far i apologize in advance if this ha been previously inquired upon i have been fasting regularly and i have a regimented schedule consistently for roughly 2 year now i get up at 3 30am everyday and in the home gym by 4 00am my workout consists of light cardio bike rower jump rope rope for about 30minutes and another 30minutes doing mobility flexibility work then about an hour of weight lifting not bodybuilding and some crossfit esq type workout during this activity i am in a fasted state which i will break around 11 00am 12 00pm which translates to about 18 hour of fasting my question during this ketosis state my body is in if i get a cholesterol check will it register an elevated result i am 45 year old and i consider my diet low to mid in saturated fat i eat red meat once a month and do not regularly consume processed food i apologize for the longish post here and thanks in advance best regard

1,monday keto tuesday fast wednesday to sunday normal omnivoric diet anyone had experience doing a similar cycle so my main aim for doing this is to get the autophagy and mental focus of keto fasting whilst also having more energy in the gym i follow pavel's simple and sinister and will be training mma again when covid permit from a normal carbohydrate containing diet i've been fasting once a week around 24 36 hour i want to have a weekly fast because i really like the idea of boosting autophagy once a week and giving my system a reset i'm hoping this will make me disease resistant a i age however during my monday weekly fast i'm unproductive for for pretty much the whole day until the evening i start my fast from around 9pm on the sunday i figured that in the evening i've been entering ketosis and that's when i'm able to be uber productive this productivity last until my next meal monday dinner or tuesday lunch depending how i'm feeling i wa hoping that a i did this more i'd be able to enter ketosis quicker but this hasn't been the case so far i'm thinking that if i eat keto on the monday i'll be able to feel fine all day and then be in ketosis by tuesday ha anyone tried something similair any tip history i've done strict keto for 6 month it wasn't for me i've been experimenting with fasting for the last 2 year any information you guy can give me would be most welcome shout out to this subreddit for all the information it's given me so far

1,different way of tracking i recently recommitted to keto after a hiatus sparked by the holiday and which ha dragged on a few month longer than i planned i decided to do something differently with my tracking this around i wa using fitness tracker which wa fine but the problem i had wa that i would eat something that seemed keto and then track it sometimes not until the end of the day or even the following morning even when i thought i wa in good shape for the day i often found myself in the 30 40 gm territory from sneaky carb content meal planning would help address this but i am someone who really ha a hard time eating thing i m not on the mood for and i tend to graze out of the fridge for most of my meal i only really cook proper meal on the weekend otherwise it s just throwing together a plate of meat cheese and whatever else look good my solution is to compile a spreadsheet of the keto food i like best and eat most i captured their net carbs per my typical serving i categorized them by general type and in order of what i should be eating protein veg seed nut fat condiment fruit then i sorted the content with in each category from most to least net carbs per my typical serving because it s on my computer screen it s easy to track throughout the day and then i can easily see what my balance of net carbs is and then look at my option by scanning the top and middle of each category when i m running low on carbs by keeping protein at the top i m channeling my snacking on that direction since i can scan the list until something look good starting with protein versus scanning my fridge and starting with cheese or hot dog i m still tracking macro and calorie this just offer a way for me to narrow my choice within the band they should be in

1,anyone have difficulty waking up on keto i ve been keto for 3+ month pretty steadily down close to 20lbs i m also working out very regularly 4 5 day per week most morning i really struggle to get out of bed despite 8+ hour of sleep once i m up and moving i feel good 
1,circuit dieting with keto any merit to this phenomenon 2 week in ketosis 1 week just slightly out of it amp repeat so i have done keto a couple of time for weight loss now amp it usually start off fast with the weight loss amp then slows down a lot a few week in with zero change in diet i ve gotten stuck like this a few time before amp there wa a few time in the past where i took a short few day to week long break from ketosis for example most recently i took a break to partake in a small slice of birthday cake the very next day down a pound repeat down another pound after a few day up to a week this effect level off and then the weight loss sits stagnant so start up ketosis again amp the weight loss is back to normal again then a couple week later and the weight loss slows down again i ve noticed this phenomenon a few time now amp i ve chalked it up to comparing it to the enhanced effect of circuit training exercise in which you have short period of altering level of intense exercise to reap benefit exceeding that of a regular consistent pace for the same time so ha anyone else here ever read about it experienced this effect of circuit dieting in the ketogenic diet seems like it work but i d like to see some confirmation

1,struggling to lose weight at a healthy speed hi all i'm 24 5'8 and most recently weighed in at 91kg i know how i managed to put on the weight but now i'm struggling to lose it safely my biggest problem is snacking after every meal i always wanted something sweet and then in the evening i'd have crisp and biscuit i knew how unhealthy it wa but didn't stop my issue now is that i'm perfectly content eating keto meal but i feel like i'm struggling to eat a healthy amount of calorie everyday for example yesterday i had an omelette with two egg for breakfast i didn't have lunch and then for dinner i had roasted chicken breast with a very small salad at the side i wasn't hungry or uncomfortable throughout the day and feel like i could continue eating like that for month but i know i'm not eating enough what do you guy recommend a good way to increase calorie either through snack or something i could add to my meal to improve it i started last friday and i'm down 5lb whilst it's good to see those number i do acknowledge it's pretty quick and in future i'll just be at risk of yoyo'ing 
1,custom keto diet video what is it and what make it a lifestyle a ketogenic lifestyle consists of eating the ketogenic way low carb high healthy fat and moderate protein 99 percent of the time even if it s your birthday what doe it mean to eat ketogenic though well basically you eat in such a way that your body produce ketone don t worry this is not scary in fact ketone can protect your brain from alzheimer s and other problem such a brain fog and memory what if you started eating the way your ancestor used to eat what would that look like when you consider what your ancestor did not have namely processed food you can see what that might look like the food around wa that which wa easily available such a berry wild animal and vegetable that are easy to grow like spinach cabbage broccoli and cauliflower because it wa hard to catch food they also had to ensure everything they ate wa a high in fat a possible so that they could keep on enough weight to be healthy but not fake fat of course healthy fat from fruit like coconut oil and olive oil some people also enjoy ghee which is clarified butter in this plan that s the other thing that is awesome about the ketogenic lifestyle you do have lot of leeway in what you eat if it follows the main goal which are to eat low carb high fat and moderate protein most of the time processed food is full of refined sugar unhealthy fat and chemical that no one can pronounce and will leave you unsatisfied always craving more and guess what it s not your fault if you re always craving more they made the food that way the food you re eating is designed to cause craving processed food is made to hook you on it just like opiate the food scientist know the exact combination of fat salt and sugar to hook you they ve found the formula to make every meal into a drug what s worse is that this drug will make you fat unhealthy prone to diabetes and you ll likely die earlier than you otherwise would even when you think you re eating small amount of food called diet food you can be fat and very unhealthy in fact thin people whoare eating a fully processed diet are also very unhealthy and prone to illness disease manifest differently in everyone thankfully the ketogenic diet ha become more mainstream people are taking to it and getting healthier they re getting healthier because it s simple they don t have to think too hard to know whether they can have that food or not due to this fact it make it easy for the ketogenic way of eating to become a full on lifestyle that s good because one thing that can ensure that people really change for life and make eating keto a habit is to turn it into a lifestyle when you know you re going to live this way forever that you re not taking break and that you re not doing it for just the next few week until the big party then you tend to stick to a healthier way of eating because it s just normal and natural since ketogenetic eating is so natural you ll agree that it can easily become a lifestyle

1,keto and blood sugar so i ve been reading a lot of the faq and the post here people seem to indicate that keto isn t necessarily just about the amount of ketos produced nor consumed by the body but about blood sugar too now obviously there is a correlation but what i am curious is why glycemic index seems to be talked about a lot is it because certain food that raise your blood sugar too fast more detrimental to being in a state of ketosis than others

1,want to go back on keto but scared of the judgement earlier this year i went keto for about 2 month i went on it strictly for weight loss but along the way i found myself really enjoying the side effect i felt more energized more alert had a decrease in appetite and felt more empowered determined amp x200b i stopped doing keto due to a surgery i had to get and my doctor recommended that i return to a regular diet while i recover truly i miss doing keto for most people it can be a challenging regime to follow there's definitely a lot of willpower determination and self control that go into it but it definitely made me proud of myself that i wa following through amp x200b many people know that keto is under a lot of scrutiny by the medium a majority of the time i saw this with my friend a well when i started getting into keto and had to be more conscious of what i ate i felt judged and unsupported the common thing they would say is what a lot of people hear this doesn't seem sustainable at all you're not going to die if you have carbs this isn't healthy at all you're just going to end up gaining all the weight back once you finish anyway i would explain the positive change i wa seeing but it would go in one ear and out the other sometimes a part of me felt like it came from jealousy my roommate on the other hand had no problem with my keto diet and frankly didn't even care that i wa on it amp x200b i know people will say that they're not my real friend if they don't support me but i don't like to fall under this line of thinking they're great friend but i feel that people are more supportive of keto after they've done it my parent were both keto for a year and my aunt ha been keto for 4 year and they were super supportive of me amp x200b so my question is what have been your experience with judgment towards your regime and how did you ignore overcome it what kept you motivated throughout etc amp x200b note i am a female in my 20 along with all my friend this can definitely play a role lol

1,three week in hey all amp x200b i'm about three week into keto and i'm just really grateful for not only the diet itself but also the great information i've gleaned by lurking around this sub amp x200b utilizing essentially a form of dirty keto and 16 8 if i've been able to break down my almost nightly acid reflux to 0 one occurrence in the last three week tone down my junk food craving and get to a point where i almost forget to eat during the day and while i don't personally look all that much different the scale informs me that i've dropped 16 since starting amp x200b a few observation i don't know if it's the keto or the if or both but they do something magical to my craving very little if any junk carb craving i haven't broken my occasional need for an energy drink in the morning but it's definitely lessened and when i need one i reach for a red bull zero or a rockstar total zero fallen in love with chicken thigh batch cook them in the instant pot shred them and store them in the fridge for a cheese wrap salad or just heated in a bowl with frank red hot there's still an occasional sweet tooth calling me and i've discovered the absolute best alternative atkins peanut butter cup 3g net carbs and they're a delicious a reeses cheese cheese cheese cheese amp x200b so thank you all again and i can't wait to share another update in the future

1,analytics comparison from my two keto period hi i had a very successful first 'attempt' at a keto diet last summer which i thoroughly enjoyed losing almost 9 5 kg and 3 5 body fat in 3 4 month whilst the diet wa sustainable i felt great healthy energetic etc i did quit for 3 4 month and following the birth of my daughter and an over indulgent christmas break i had put pretty much all of it back on which i thought wa fair enough i've tried again this year with some success 6 5kg and 3 2 body fat loss in the same period but finding it harder work and le rewarding this time around i think a the gain are slower than the previous period i'm copying below the 'data points' from both period and i'd really greatly appreciate your feedback to help me get answer to my two main question 1 i've used so many different calculator it's difficult to know what kind of weight and body fat loss i should be targeting per week and if my macro are or were optimised i got the feeling with attempt 1 i wa potentially losing weight a little 'too quickly' but that also gave me the flexibility to have cheat day knowing it would not derail me for too long 2 should i be taking the logical approach and reverting to my previous macro where i wa getting result i wa happy with i am currently 85kg which is by no mean heavy but my body fat is around 25 fat which i am desperate to reduce i do very little exercise currently due to a combination of covid and new family life if that make any difference attempt 1 average fat 120g 65 protein 105g 25 carbs 17g 4 cal 1600 0 7kg and 0 3 fat loss per week attempt 2 average fat 110g 55 protein 135g 35 carbs 17g 4 cal 1700 0 3kg and 0 1 fat loss per week thank you so much in advance

1,is this normal i started keto march 16 a couple week ago i wa around 193 then i ve started keto twice before but gave up both time i dropped 10 pound in the first week this time i wa keeping up with my water way better however this time i only dropped 4 4 pound in the first week yesterday i woke up to discover i weighed a pound more than i did the morning before i still weigh exactly that this morning 185 8 so in these week i ve essentially only dropped 2 pound at most since i will regain at least 5 pound of water weight a soon a i go back to eating carbs this diet is not going to be a lifetime change for me i wa just trying to drop some quick pound before trying for another baby with the hubby i ve been logging my daily food intake and have stayed well within my carb goal of le than 18g a day often i m ending the day with 8 or more carbs remaining i ve also not gone over my other macro either and have stayed within range of all of them i m definitely not eating too much and i don t snack much a i hate virtually all sugar alternative snack my ketone test all come back positive everyday is this normal weight loss or should i just give up maybe keto just cannot work for me this is a very hard diet to stick to i ve no problem giving up snack a i d already limited myself before i started keto but no pasta or rice or bread is very hard still i could easily stick with it if it were actually doing any good but at this point i feel it s not doing much of anything at all two pound maybe in the first week is not worth it i could eat healthier and force myself to actually excessive for that measly amount any thought advice especially from those keto veteran out there would be great thanks

1,not losing now but i used to melt away when i tried keto last year hello and thanks to anyone who responds in advance i have been on keto for 6 week and have lost 4 pound i've been strict and have only cheated once with half a piece of cake at my own engagement dinner i'm frustrated because i tried keto a few time last year and the weight would melt off me i lost 13 pound then 17 pound but gained the weight back once i abandoned the lifestyle i thought the next time i'd try keto i'd have no problem losing the weight but this year ha been so different i've been the strictest i've ever been on keto and i have barely lost anything most day i do about an hour to an hour 15 min of cardio on an empty stomach it's not super strenuous but i've mixed up doing walking and hiit some day and just walking and elliptical on others i don't believe i'm over exercising i ordered a keto mojo about 3 week ago and my fasting glucose is in the 70 80 range my ketone level is consistently under 1 one or two day it went up to 1 5 but i mostly stay at 0 5 to 0 8 i did one meal a day for about 2 week making sure my one meal wa rich in good fat i'd drink coffee eat 3 farm fresh egg keto toast with 4 net gram carbs and i would make an avocado spread and of course mct oil i reduced my cheese intake and nut intake i do not eat keto snack since i haven't been losing i've looked into whether a few of the food like for example the keto bread are causing my blood sugar to rise i've tested this using my ketomojo to test my bg and ketone 30 min 1 hour and 3 hour after i eat no problem with the food none of the one i suspected increased my blood sugar more than 25 unit at 30 min and i returned to baseline by 3 hour yes i get good sleep no i don't think i'm that stressed out at all any help would be very much appreciated why am i not losing like before should i do fasting one meal a day i do that then read that the reason i'm not losing is because my calorie count is too low i'm so discouraged and sad

1,sucess depois de dar à luz nosso filho em julho passado eu sabia que precisava perder peso ma eu estava com medo eu havia tentado e falhado tantas vezes que simplesmente não conseguia passar pela ansiedade impaciência autocrítica desespero e derrota mais uma vez portanto decidi esperar até que estivesse emocionalmente pronto para perder peso graças a esta submissão eu já estava mentalmente preparado e sabia o que precisava fazer quando estivesse pronto para me comprometer para mim prontidão emocional significava aprender a ser grato pelo meu corpo tinha carregado doi bebês lindos um que pesava 4 5 kg ao nascer e era forte apesar de ano de estresse e alimentação estressante também tive que parar de ver minha dieta como um castigo por engordar e em vez disso começar a ver a perda de peso como um presente que eu queria dar ao meu corpo por tudo que ele fez por mim e finalmente eu tive que deixar de acreditar que eu tinha que fazer keto perfeitamente e se eu não o fizesse eu estava condenado ao fracasso e acabaria desistindo de novo quando reiniciei o keto em 9 de fevereiro me pesei ma não tirei nenhuma foto eu não rastreei minhas macro ou registrei minha comida porque rastrear essas coisas sempre me fez questionar se eu estava otimizando meus esforços eu simplesmente comia alimentos com pouco ou nenhum carboidrato principalmente carne queijo ovos manteiga e vegetais tirei uma foto ante alguns dia depois ma apenas de frente e de trás e então algumas semanas depois disso tirei algumas fotos depois de ver alguém neste grupo dizer como isso foi útil para ela amp x200b email goldboy rj gmail com

1,how long do you stay on keto i've heard 3 6 month at the most i've been on it for about 2 month and have lost about 5 pound i've had 2 all out cheat day that were birthday celebration for people so i'm sure that temporarily derailed my progress but wondering what others feel about how long to continue on keto 
1,is long term keto bad i wa on keto two week and it seemed fine just ate chicken and veggie the entire time for veggie broccoli and kale also a multi vitamin so i don t up vitamin deficient but my friend said it s a good idea to have a carb cheat day after a few week this way your body doesn t go in sugar shock if you ever end up eating a candy bar a few month after and i looked online and it say long term keto can even cause insulin resistance diabetes so i decided instead to do continuous 2 week keto with a carb day between so chicken and veggie every 2 week with carb day of bean potato carrot and apple in between would that work to prevent diabetes on keto 
1,keeping it simple huge libido increase no pm long post so a few week back i posted here i wa getting anxious about cholesterol and a family history of heart disease i just kept going mostly because it just made sense for my body never ever have i felt this happy before while doing a major change on my diet and i followed most of the advice people gave me here i am a 37 f mother of 2 and i still have some weight to lose these last few week i switched yoga for belly dance 3 4 day a week kept eating fat protein some vegetable a bit of zucchini here and there and cauliflower and green leaf spinach lettuce etc so everything's going great but i wanted to ask some of the woman here i've read many post about keto worsening your pm but my experience wa the absolute opposite i've been eating keto for almost a month now and i've always suffered before my period really bad pm horrible migraine a cyst in my right ovary that sometimes caused excruciating pain having to go to the er on some occasion cramp loose stool vomiting joint pain and binge eating this month wa nothing like that smooth a silk i didn't have any craving though i ate cocoa nib before and dark chocolate with no sugar i did indulge in hot cocoa with a bit of cream and some drop of stevia don't really use sweetener at all but this time i did and on my first day i'm feeling surprisingly better than i have felt in year a side effect though is that a week after i started eating keto my libido went up high a hell like a teenager i've been looking for an explanation but i still can't quite get it is it the estrogen because of the meat i'm eating have i always been healthier and hornier and i just got stuck on an awful lifestyle for most of my life it feel crazy i'm not even counting calorie i just stay keto a naturally a i can keeping it very simple and i know i've lost weight my balance is broken so idk how much i've lost but i don't think just losing weight can make me this horny or feeling so good about myself or work on my cyst and my ovary and pm it feel so amazing 6 month ago my then boyfriend told me he didn't love me anymore i don't even know what i wa thinking being with him it wa the worse relationship of my life and a i look back now i feel so different from that overweight overtired and turned off woman that i wa then i'm just so amazed by this return to health so to speak i've been approached by other men i feel is something that it is also starting to show in the outside so it's not just a feeling apparently i had sex with a guy i used to date but my libido still can't get enough what's wrong with me i can't say that i'm feeling like running a marathon now that i'm on my period it still hurt a bit and i still use a warm bottle but i'm not cry in pain or feeling indisposed still feel horny though that make me really curious so have any of you girl woman have noticed this kind of hormonal change tldr almost a month of keto pm went away libido is high a hell want to know if someone ha gone through a similar situation

1,read those nutrition ingredient label for sneaky carbs so i bought a bag of pork rind the other day so i could have an easy snack while working it wa an impulse purchase a i wa checking out at the store so i didn't read the ingredient list a thoroughly a i typically would later that day a i wa munching on the pork rind and nearing the end of the bag i noticed the crumb at the bottom had a distinctly sweet taste hm weird the bag said zero carb but i know the taste of sugar when it hit my taste bud so i flip the bag over and check the nutritional info it indeed list the carb count a 0 okay let's take a look at the ingredient then and there we have it listed a the second ingredient is coconut palm sugar is this a huge deal well it could be for some people depending on their daily allotment of total carb intake but it might be just fine for others my whole point is just to be mindful of what's really in those product we consider safe or keto friendly be aware that even though the front of a package claim the item is zero carb there still might be undesirable ingredient in the product btw the brand wa 4505 and the flavor wa classic 
1,i couldn t make progress on keto until i stopped trying to make progress on keto story and photo after giving birth to our son last july i knew i needed to lose weight but i wa afraid to i had tried and failed so many time i simply did not have it in me to go through the anxiety impatience self criticism hopelessness and defeat once again so i decided i would wait until i wa emotionally ready to lose weight thanks to this sub i wa already mentally prepared and knew what i needed to do once i wa ready to commit for me emotional readiness meant learning to be grateful for my body it had carried two beautiful baby one who weighed 10 13 lb at birth and wa strong despite year of stress and stress eating i also had to stop seeing my diet a a punishment for getting fat and instead start seeing weight loss a a gift that i wanted to give my body for everything it ha done for me and finally i had to let go of the belief that i had to do keto perfectly and that if i didn t i wa doomed to failure and would just wind up quitting again when i restarted keto on february 9 i weighed myself but i did not take any picture i did not track my macro or log my food because tracking these thing ha always caused me to question whether i wa optimizing my effort i simply ate low carb to no carb food mostly meat cheese egg butter and veggie i took a before picture a few day later but only from the front and back and then a few week after that i took some side picture after seeing someone in this group say how helpful it wa to her i am now 7 week in i still don t track anything although i weigh myself every few day because the number no longer cause analysis paralysis i ve lost 20 pound and still have another 40 pound to go before i will be at a comfortable healthy bmi i would like to try if at some point but i m letting myself settle into this new normal for a little while longer and even though the judgmental voice inside my head is telling me not to post this i let fear and shame tell me how to feel about my body for decade also i have learned so much from this sub and have been inspired by so many people here i thought i would share my story for anyone else who may be afraid to try again http imgur com a kofivzo

1,eating green everyday is essential to loosing weight on keto for me personally anyways i've heard friend and people on here say that the reason that they think they start to stall on keto is because of them eating keto desert i thought the same too we were keeping it under 20 carbs everyday so what wa wrong then i tried something that i wa avoiding i started loosing weight immediately were you still eating your green i found out that for me personally it wasn't so much of the rebel ice cream and general keto stuff everyday that wa messing up my progress i learned that a soon a i added green veggie into my diet everyday i started losing weight again immediately but i still eat the ice cream atkins and everything keto related like that i do this pretty much everyday like now i eat 2 3 small bag of those quest chip 4 net carbs each i know but they are so good two peanut butter cup 2 net carbs two cheesy hot dog wrapped in keto bread or one split keto tortilla 2 for bread or 5 carbs for tortilla and a full can of green bean with butter and salt and pepper i dont generally count these carbs especially if i'm under 20 by that point i lose a 8 to a pound every 2 day i'll also switch the desert out with whatever i have at the time like pecan ice cream ugh yes i now keep my carbs pretty loose if i go over 20 it usually just 23 and the rest is filled with the green bean 7 idk if this will work for everyone because you might already be incorporating green everyday and there might be another seemingly inexplicable reason why your stalling but i do hope that this will reach another me out there who think that eating meat and cheese and everything else just to avoid green is the move because it isn't i learned that the hard way lol unless you're making it work then heck yeah 
1,scanning in meat silly questio alert when tracking macro do i track the cooked weight or raw weight a 1kg scanned of raw chicken drumstick is like 2300kcal v when there cooked it like 600g which 1380 kcal so quite be quite a difference

1,i finally found an electrolyte powder with no sugar and i'm getting told i need the glucose for mineral absorption what my dad is obsessed with fitness and exercise and ha been mostly low carb for year i got excited about finally finding an electrolyte powder that ha 0 sugar and he said it useless because you need the glucose to absorb the potassium and other mineral this doesn't sound right to me at all i did some reading and found some stuff about how insulin glucose increase cellular uptake of potassium and lower serum level there also a relationship with potassium and insulin where low potassium result in low insulin and people have higher blood sugar level i can't really find anything else can anyone help me with this am i better off drinking the electrolyte powder that ha glucose in it 
1,time to get my life in order hey everyone i'm m46 having struggled for the vast majority of my life with my weight going up to 330lbs at my peak in my late 20 yo yo ing up and down stabilizing at about 275 for a few year until i decided about 15 year ago to go through bariatric surgery and get a lap band that helped me out for a while bringing my weight down to about 225 but i wa building a ton of muscle at that point going to the gym 5 day a week for a mix of light cardio and strength and then of course life got in the way i work in tech which meant long hour grabbing whatever i could eat and thing crept up over the last 20 year i've also been suffering from mild clinical depression nothing crazy but enough to add to the uggggggghh aspect of life and exercise and coming up with excuse not to do x y or z unsurprisingly thing were a lot better during my healthy period and my psychiatrist ha often recommended focusing on my weight loss to get better easier said than done especially when living in my head the challenge for me ha been trust and accountability i'm married with 2 kid and am the cook of the house my wife ha known me forever 40+ year and ha seen me through all of my phase i love her to death and i know she mean well but she can be very judgmental and over the year i've lost my ability to have a proper discussion around anything regarding my health or weight i just get incredibly defensive and change the subject i've also tried and somewhat successfully lost a decent chunk of weight a few year back i got into golfing after year of making fun of my parent and started ww at the time and dropped a good 25lbs in a few week but i would do all of this avoiding conversation with the family or even mentioning i wa doing it given i'm the cook in the house it didn't lead to good sustaining result this accountability problem didn't just lie with how i interacted with my family heck my feeling of repeated failure kept pushing me to delay visit to doctor for checkup and given my family ha a long history of diabetes and some heart disease it wa incredibly irresponsible i'm a walking heart attack waiting to happen i'd always push my reminder out a few month until i'd lose enough weight to have some good news to give my dr a she gave me the look of disappointment a few month back i realized that a year of quarantine killed what little exercise i wa getting at work and my day consisted of 10 hour on my desk chair a few hour with the family and then a few hour watching tv or back to work my sleeping pattern were messed up because i'd choose to fall asleep on the couch setting my alarm for 5am to then go up to bed so my wife could get a really good night sleep without me snoring next to her no sleep apnea but boy i can be a trumpet my back is shot i can barely walk straight and am in constant pain i'm an 80 year old man in a 40something body the thought of the pandemic being over and the world going back to normal is both exciting but also agonizing no more excuse to do absolutely nothing while my depression ha always been fairly mild i've lost family member to suicide and would never ever every think of inflicting something like that on my own family and friend but hey if i died from a heart attack would that be so bad i felt like i hit rock bottom i know it sound dumb but it took all my courage to sit down with my wife and tell her that it wa time i wa seeking help and that while i knew she meant well i needed her to give me some room here i'd tried keto a few time for short period of time and it suit me well in general a i'm not really a carbs person anyhow but doing it in hiding is incredibly difficult i decided to bite the bullet and sign up to virta health buy a peloton and say screw it i'll be the guy who come in 100 thousandth on leaderboards for a while but i know i'll be better two thing that work with me accountability and gamification virta hold me accountable no hiding the coach is on you daily everything's measured it forced me to go to the dr and get result and i'm just incredibly lucky that despite all the abuse my body ha taken my blood sugar and cholesterol number are high but below any problematic number peloton once i get started gamifies thing i started on duolingo learning japanese a couple of year back for the fun of it and not only kept going regardless of what wa going on but made me decide to take formal lesson and go to japan all that because of that damn streak i know all of this is irrelevant to all of you but honestly r keto ha been an inspiration for the last few year and seeing all of your story wa really the inspiration to get started this is just the beginning but i wanted to say thank you for nudging me to get on the bandwagon that i'm sure i'll fall off of but get back on again i owe it to myself and my amazing family amp x200b thank you all for making it this far

1,doctor wa impressed so about five week ago i went to the doctor and received my first official diagnosis of diabetes i had had problem having healthcare prior to now and wa able to get it in january after not having it for a long time but i suspected that wa the case for some time now after 5 week i went back for a follow up my a1c1 is down 2 entire point in only 5 week with keto 15 lb weight loss and metformin it's almost at normal range and is currently normal based on my blood glucose test the a1c1 will assuredly go down some more in a couple month after the metformin and keto have been doing their stuff in synergy my doctor wa impressed i have never seen a doctor be so perky and delighted he told me to keep up the good work and complimented me three or four time i wasn't even sure how to take that much praise lol he also said he thought i could reverse my diabetes get off of the metformin and should strive for that lucky break there getting the doctor who know this is possible and doesn't just treat it like it's a done deal i hope this story however simple help other people see how good this way of eating can be i know the doctor is right and i'm going to keep on fighting for my life and quality of life i knew diabetes wa bad but i didn't know some of the thing the doctor informed me about it's really easy to realize now that a lot of my health nag are from the diabetes i can do this and so can all of you if anyone need a support buddy i'm open to that i could probably use a few people to talk to too will happily trade non reddit messenger good luck and good day everyone

1,keto in japan hard but improving hey keto hero just wondering if anyone life in japan and doing keto at the same time i have been doing keto for a few month and finding it's challenging to buy any food from a restaurant a keto friendly the japanese people crazily into sugar everything almost everything add a lot of sugar even some food are labeled low card they still contain 10 20g net carbs in a small serve the only way to do this for me is to cook at home every day when i go to work i have to bring my food but somehow im getting used to it it's also not that good once your friend call you to dine out but still people around you are getting used to the fact that you are a picky mouth so good to live in japan to have some excellent quality wagyu beef and all kind of fresh fatty fish but a low carb diet still ha a long way to go here

1,vince gironda 12 egg shake meal compatibility i wa researching vince gironda's old school body building diet and found out that amongst other thing he suggests a breakfast shake consisting of 12 raw egg 12 oz half and half scoop of whey and a banana i understand some may say this isn't keto because of the banana but banana still have a lower gi than other fiber option my question is how bad would it be to consume non keto meal with this for lunch and dinner ie chili for lunch and pasta for dinner is this shake designed to eat alongside with keto meal the rest of the day otherwise would one just get fat

1,constant fatigue while on keto i ve been doing keto on and off for a year now and lost almost 100 pound which is fantastic i also have significantly improved thought clarity my only problem is although i feel healthier think better and am able to exercise for longer i m constantly fatigued my diet is primarily composed of different meat burger pork chicken egg primarily but trying to incorporate more seafood and a lot of spinach salad w mixed veggie sometimes just opting for chopped veggie and dip i ve been taking 200mg magnesium supplement nightly and also salt the shit out of everything eating pickle if i ever get that headachy feeling drink lot of water some of which is carbonated the lightly flavoured sweetener free stuff i also make sure to count my calorie with carb manager and maintain around a 15 deficit anyone else have experience with constant fatigue on keto or know what i might be doing wrong diet supplement etc 
1,6 month in and hitting a wall hi so i started keto back in october due to a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes a1c 6 9 i try to stay around 1500 calorie a day and under 25g of carbs since october i have lost 65lbs and i m super proud of the progress i ve made my sugar level on my meter have also been really good always between 4 0 and 4 4 mmo l 1 5 2 hour after eating since i got my meter two week into keto lately however i ve been finding myself increasingly hungrier and overeating on some day my weight loss ha stalled i still have about 60lbs to lose and i m feeling discouraged any tip 
1,is there anything i can just eat doing some research and reading the faq ha provided me some more insight into keto and i realize that i wa introduced to this diet with incorrect information it wa pitched to me a if you limit your carbs you can eat all the fat you need specifically i wa told i could eat all the bacon steak and chicken i wanted i'm starting to realize that isn't the case if i'm trying to lose weight i need to also limit my fat intake and do workout i appreciate this and i'll try to adjust myself accordingly which mean i can't just eat a pound of bacon with my egg every morning i suppose my problem is really that i'm used to just eating whenever i want and i'm trying to limit myself but is there any thing out there i can just eat to satisfy the desire to eat like is there anything that doesn't need to be limited if i get the desire to eat something at 10pm can i snack on some mozzarella cheese some lettuce zucchini noodle boiled egg is there anything i don't need to limit 
1,i d like your thought i ve been keto for almost 1 year exactly i ve been very dedicated i ve had a few piece of pizza early on maybe two month in and it really didn t have any negative effect i m getting together for a family event this afternoon and they bought spaghetti from my favorite restaurant my question is since pasta is so carb heavy would it be a super bad idea i can resist it no problem but i ve heard that carb loading once in a while is ok and even beneficial thanks everyone

1,cheese i've recently gotten back into deep ketosis but to satisfy some nasty craving i have been frying cheese lol i am still maintaining a huge daily calorie deficit and the cheese add some nice protein to keep me at my desired 0 45ish per pound i am just wondering if there is anything bad about significant cheese intake at least in term of buying fat again i am at a huge deficit but i haven't been tracking my actual fat intake and just sort of winging it in that area lol amp x200b thanks in advance

1,question about fat bomb hi all i hope you can clear up something that's confusing me if fat is not a goal then what's the point of fat bomb i've been surprisingly not hungry since i started back on keto a month ago and sometimes looking at my macro toward the end of the day it seems like i need more of a protein bomb rather than fat bomb my fat is under too but if i don't need to eat to a fat goal why should i eat a fat bomb when i'd rather burn my own fat

1,keto and thyroid ha anyone here had a problem with keto and thyroid i have hashimoto s thyroiditis for over 20 year now it s been very stable for the last 10 i ve lost 30+ pound on keto lately tho i wa getting really hungry and losing my control also struggling with horrible insomnia which made me of course completely exhausted during the day i wa thinking it wa perimenopause symptom then my hand started shaking i knew right away went and got lab work done and sure enough i m hyper that mean i m getting too much thyroid hormone this can cause insomnia heart racing hand shaking increased appetite lot of fun thing sometimes it take me a hot minute to figure out that it is a thyroid hormone fluctuation especially now because it s been so stable for so long once before i lost weight 100 pound on ww and my level went up a lot which seems counter intuitive you would think lost weight lower blood volume you would need le hormone nope needed more but sometimes this stupid disease is annoying like that but this time i wonder about the gf aspect of this diet i had a friend who wa diagnosed went gf and never had to go on med citing the inflammatory nature of gluten hence my curiosity of could the gf aspect of keto be affecting the function of my thyroid i can get an adjustment of medication and the insomnia and other symptom will dissipate i know this but i m curious if anyone else on here ha experienced this have thyroid disease done keto and had it affect you not eating gluten ha been really good for me in so many way i really don t want to go back to it

1,question on how much fat i should be eating i played with full carnivore for 3 month and it wa a lot of fun but sadly i didn't follow through now i am doing some research again and trying keto this time round i am going to be a little more scientific if i eat 1 200 gram of whole chicken the yield are protein 326g total fat 162g calorie 2858 here are my macro gender male age 48 weight 75 kg height 183 cm calorie goal 10 surplus protein 104g carbs 23g fat 211g target 2404 kcal amp x200b so i would need to supplement more fat into my diet because i am deficit by 49 gram 211 162 then i just swallow some butter or olive oil or whatever healthy fat correct 1 tablespoon 12 7817005 gram hence 49 12 8 approximately 4 tablespoon correct also another question since the entire chicken yield 326g of protein and my macro allows me daily of 104g is there any too much negative from eating too much protein amp x200b thanks

1,how do you maintain weight on the keto diet over the past year and a half i've lost 7 and a half stone and i'm at a healthy weight now i started keto to basically kick my addiction to sugary food and drink and limit my carbs i'm not really trying to loose too much weight because people keep saying i'm losing too much too fast i managed to steady my weight loss by eating more on day when i wa most active i have an active job which burn a lot of calorie i ended up having to snack on food to try and keep my calorie up it's been just over a week and i feel so much better no chocolate crisp burger chip cheesy mash pizza ice cream sugary energy or alcohilic drink the thing i eat drink most i've been having so much salad and veg and meat always meal prepping i even started to cook before i would just grab what wa there because it wa convenient whilst i wa hungry i'm even starting to get hungry le and just snack on seed and nut and these low carb cracker type thing with peanut butter or cheesy spread this i know will do me a world of good health wise my only issue is i don't think i'm meeting my calorie goal for the amount i burn when working and i work a lot a lot of it is probably water weight but i've lost 6 5 pound in a week and any more it will take me lower than the threshold i want to stay in i have a limit for how heavy i want to be and a limit on how small i want to be what can i do to stay on keto but bump up my calorie intake i've got fitness pal where i add all the food and then i use the data from my garmin watch to see roughly how much i've burned and it show i need to have quite a bit more to maintain or at least not lose too much suggestion

1,how long will it take to loose 30lbs in my case i'm completely new to keto but want to give it a try i'm a female 5 11 and 180 lb my goal is 150 lb so 30 lb loss is what i'm working towards i'm going to use the carb manager app and also count my calorie incorporating some exercise + 16 8 intermittent fasting this is the plan and i'm nervous but ready and determined my question how long will it take to loose this 30 lb in my case what's been your personal experience i eat very well and clean but it seems this 30 lb is very stubborn and struggle to budge i'm going to keep my calorie only at a medium deficit aiming for 0 5 1 lb of weight loss per week 
1,keto weight loss to date i started my keto diet just a day over one month ago my weight at that time wa 262 i m 6 5 with a muscular build so i didn t appear too fat at that weight but none of my summer clothes fit anymore there s no running from that yesterday morning i weighed in at 244 i d like to get to about 225 i must say it s been incredibly easy so far i m rarely hungry i eat more at breakfast than i ever did before keto i ve cut back a little at dinner mainly because i m not eating potato any more i rarely ate lunch before keto and i still don t i miss my fuji apple and clementine but it s a small sacrifice if you re thinking about keto my advice is to go for it 
1,possibly insane notion fish oil for cooking so i have a bit of a crazy question that might be possibly a really good idea i fail to regularly take suppliments and know that i should eat more fish i try to eat a tin of sardine once a week and my partner isnt too keen on eating fish so getting my omega 3 is pretty hard i came to a bit of a revelation that maybe i could use fish oil instead of olive oil to cook my meal now fish oil is really damn expensive to buy a 500ml bottle for 30 but hear me out i came across fish oil suppliments for race horse and greyhound that are quite cheep for 20l tin at 60 is this a crazy idea or am i onto something here 
1,blood test during keto diet first time i tried keto wa on february 1st lasted for two week quit due to heart palpitation i suspect i wasn t getting enough electrolyte even though i had 3 cup of spinach daily and lot of meat lot of salt lot of vegetable started again yesterday but i want to do it properly this time so i asked my mom if we can get nosalt and magnesium citrate to help me but she s convinced i don t need to supplement at all i disagree because even when i tried my best to eat the right food i wa still getting symptom i came up with the idea to get a blood test during my keto diet to prove i m right but i used a keto stick today 2nd day on keto and i m not in ketosis yet my mom want me to get the blood test on friday will any electrolyte deficiency show up in 3 day if i stick to the diet or should i wait longer i don t want to get a blood test only for it to say i m fine which prof my mom right and then a week later start getting symptom of electrolyte deficiency tl dr when should i get a blood test to see if i m getting the proper nutrient on keto 
1,keto help i m desperate i need to lose 40 60lbs by june 26th it s my best friend wedding and it s already been postponed once and i had another entire year to do so but i cant do these thing the first time keto took a mental toll on me cause everything is so expensive and i wa starving myself cause i i ve always had issue with my face fat so i tried cutting out practically everything no carbs sugar salt dairy i ve always had trouble with loosing weight and nutrition since high school i would do my research but people would be nosy about what i m doing and tell me everything i m doing wrong site always contradicting themselves to include rice in my meal but white rice is bad another site say brow rice is bad another site say rice in general is bad what am i suppose to eat just a egg alone when i would choose to get lunch from a restaurant and get something people told me is healthy i would then get told it s super unhealthy like how is a big bowl of salad unhealthy how do i do it without starving myself cause i really don t want to have to take that route of just doing what i m capable of doing and eating one meal a day and working out 2 3 time a day everyday i m already in a bad place mentally and i don t want to have to tell my bestfriend to take me out of her wedding i couldn t live with myself if i did that i ve missed so many birthday and other event cause of my anxiety my life is just at it lowest point and i want that to change and i know dropping out of the wedding will be the last straw for me i m unemployed and only willing to spend 30 40 a week if i have to to buy what i need for keto is there a already meal plan that someone can please link me to that s budget friendly if i can just get a meal plan that s easy to read i can do the work out on my own i have p90x amp insanity that we re gifted to me unfortunately they didn t come with meal plan or anything just the workout video regardless of that the meal plan are expensive 
1,simple keto icecream life story nonsense to come after recipe 2 cup heavy cream 12 gram carbs 2 scoop of cooky and cream protein powder 6 gram carbs erythritol to taste amp x200b mix the 3 together in a large bowl and whip till stiff peak package and freeze it's creamy taste good and won't throw you out of keto since the entire container a whole friggin lot contains about 18 gram of carbs you won't eat the entire thing all at once amp x200b now for the annoying life story bit due to the trouble i had eating i feel better now protein shake have kinda been my savior my 2 choice were to drink the shake or hope i get better before i starve but after a while twice daily protein shake get really boring and i had to do something to alleviate the boredom so i did what any sane person would do i made icecream out of it now i have some kind of decently sweet from the protein powder and erythritol treat to break up the monotony

1,if i eat one meal every other day omead with no carb restriction will i bounce in and out of ketosis i tried keto many time for the past 2 year i have some insulin resistance that i want to reverse due to my weight i cannot make it past week 1 on low carbs and only end up losing to 20 lb of water weight in the 1st week i plan to only eat 1 meal every other day at 9pm of 1000 calorie with no carb limit but no sugar fast food processed food and lot of protein i have fasted for a long time and did omad since high school so i can control hunger and ghrelin but i'm worried that i will bounce in and out of ketosis by fasting since it take 48 hr to be in ketosis and then eating carbs thus water weight will continuously fluctuate i know keto can lower blood sugar significantly but i can't even go past a week on keto so i want a sustainable diet that ha similar benefit ie omead fasting will this actually be the case amp x200b thank you

1,thought on low carb mission wrap http www missionfoods com product carb balance soft taco flour tortilla say net carbs is only 4g but the back say totally carbs is 19 is this a marketing ploy or could actually eat this on keto 
1,keto and lactose intolerance hello so i thought it would be interesting to start a post where everyone can discus how they are meeting their fat requirement while also staying away from milk a someone who is lactose intolerant i find it hard to meet fat requirement for keto a most keto recipe call for some kind of milky product to boost the fat content i typically stay away from alternative milk and yogurt a well so it really put me in a bind of not using any milk based product i understand the concept of healthy fat like avocado and nut but you literally have to eat so much of those to get to the fat requirement in a ketosis diet that it is ridiculous thus why i thought it would be neat if everyone can discus how they go about achieving their fat requirement while also maintaining their lactose intolerance condition it help me get idea of how to reach my own ketosis goal but possibly help other people out a well anyway i guess i'll start with my own suggestion coconut oil based fat bomb they are versatile and can take on any flavor combo i typically make a chocolate flavored one with some cocoa powder or chocolate protein powder i ve heard the peanut butter one are to die for 
1,keto v carbs why is it that i just don t have the same drive or motivation a i do on keto when eating carbohydrate i just don t understand it like you have to force yourself through everything on carbs where a keto your noepinephrinenor cortisol is just so fucking geeked you can just do it i wa just wondering why this is

1,could keto and fasting help me pas my drug test that's in 3 week daily cannabis i 23f 5'4 125lb will probably get hired for this engineering internship and smoke about 1 2 bowl every night before bed sometimes not but for the most part i lift weight every day if and sometimes do keto i want to see what i can start doing now 3 week in advance to speed up the cleansing i've heard lifting cardio and drinking lot of water is beneficial if done in advance and counterproductive a few day before the test since fasting and being in ketosis mean you are actively burning fat would those metabolite be flushed out of my system relatively quickly if not daily i'm hoping that eating healthy and keeping my stress level down also help

1,temporarily reducing protein in favor of fat i don't eat most meat i mainly eat seafood and protein shake so my protein intake isn't very flexible for the first 90 day i loved this diet because i could eat a much shrimp and fish a i wanted but now i'm starting to get burnt out on my favorite food last week i went on a two day fast to give myself a break from all the protein while it really accelerated my weight loss it hasn't fixed the protein burnout it also really lowered my appetite which make it even harder to force protein down my throat from what i've read i really need to get my caloric intake back to normal for a couple day to recover from that fast but i just can't do it with protein right now i struggled to get down 1600 calorie yesterday when i wa hoping to get up to 2000 beyond that in order to recover from the protein burnout i think i'd need at least a week away from the food that are giving me trouble how bad would it be if i significantly dropped my protein intake and replaced it with fat for a week or two while sticking to the carb limit

1,my dad ha been diagnosed with prostate cancer amp a friend suggested keto plus the usual process so a i said above ha been a very hard week dad call me up tell me the bad news if thing go badly he ll be dead in a year jeebus anyway i call a good friend amp he s reeeally into keto carnivore to be precise he suggests keto plus the usual hormone chemo amp sends me some vids of cancer specialist doctor talking about it specifically how cancer feed off sugar i m paraphrasing here that wa the general idea and how they had seen the best result combining keto with chemo hormone to beat slow cancer anyway to cut to the point dad is open to the idea so that s great he asked his doctor and they were supportive in their view at the very least he ll lose some weight a thinner coffin no no i joke i don t want him dead i think he d appreciate that joke he ha a terrible great sense of humour depending on your pov anyway obviously i want him to beat this fucking cancer the vids also talked about fasting amp how that is excellent for the body to repair he s open to all this though he seems to be a bit shocked at how prevalent carbs are i have a question is there any danger in switching to keto after 60+ year of carbs amp sugar he s not terribly overweight but he could be thinner i suppose im a bit concerned the extra fat might be challenging for his heart but maybe i m misguided here my friend tell me heart disease ha nothing to do with dietary fat also some food aren t good for diabetic like coconut right that one always surprise me but coconut is praised in keto diet it seems is there any risk for him a a diabetic in eating coconut or the risk is for diabetic on regular carb diet anyway i hope i haven t bored you with my noob question i am not on the keto diet but i think it make a lot of sense and it s informed some of my decision regarding what i eat

1,rasberries nccbd v crbd waitrose essential rasberries uk disclaimer i use cronometer so it take the value and calculated them for me if it's a u style label it factor's this in v uk european where it take the carbs a is although recently i did purchase full green cauli rice and it turned out to be 8g carbs per pack and not 3g like they said due to reading the label wrong i have the nccdb result for rasberries frozen unsweetened on cronometer and 1 cup 250g is 20 6g of net carbs i like to use 100g measurement though so 100g is 8 3g net carbs now the crdb essential waitrose frozen rasberries are 4 6g net carbs per 100g i just check the label too so you see my dilemma is nccdb generic to cover more genus or is one or both just plain not accurate i am assuming if i get any response that everyone will just say to go with the label but if nccdb is true then i'm significantly upping my carb intake

1,low calorie but meeting protein goal hi all i m just over 1 month into keto and am down 30 pound i m 6 3 400lbs i ve found that i have little to no hunger after eating between 900 1400 calorie which is significantly lower than the 30 deficit i calculated of about 2 300 calorie when i eat over 2000 calorie i feel weighed down and sluggish however i have read this can be detrimental to my health if i meet my lean body fat protein goal of 150 gram would that reduce any danger i know a big argument for crash calorie deficit is unreasonable lifestyle habit for the future but it is truly for now an amount of food that make me feel over fed and i worry increasing calorie would grind my continued weight loss to a halt any insight

1,not my first rodeo advanced lesson learned on keto round 2 hey all before i get started apology for the format of this i'm not super good at organizing my thought but i wanted to share my journey and the insight that have come to me along the way hopefully this is all decipherable to begin with i started my keto journey in late 2018 at a starting weight of 155 lb and a goal weight of 110 lb i am 32f 5'1 see picture in the imgur link at the bottom note from the picture 110 might be a little thin for me but my rationale wa that i might gain a lot of water weight and bounce back to 115 which i think is a maintainable weight that i would be really happy with so that's how i came to my goal over the course of the next year and change i lost a total of 39 pound getting to a low weight of 116 pound around january 2020 i took a 1 month keto break and went back up to 120 staying on the horse after this break wa difficult and ultimately i fell off entirely when the pandemic hit i ended up gaining 20 pound back to 140 well new year's came around and i resolved to get back to my original goal weight of 110 lb i wa pretty mad at myself that i let myself slip so much and let all that hard work go to waste so i set a really aggressive goal of 2 lb per week barring 1 or 2 bad week i have kept up with this so far it is now the end of week 11 and i have lost 17 lb i definitely noticed i have lost weight a lot faster this time around i don't believe it is because it's my second time but rather some key difference in the way i decided to approach keto the second time and i'd like to share these with you pre keto habit i wa a fairly gluttonous person with poor meal portion awareness control i just wanted to stuff my face all day everyday with my favorite food it wa the most amazing and soothing feeling in the world i lived for carbs pasta pizza and potato chip specifically i loathed exercise keto first round 2018 2019 philosophy aka thing not to do even though i lost 39 lb on it diet had always failed for me because i just wanted to always shove food in my mouth i think the reason keto initially worked for me wa because i figured out that a long a something had next to 0 carbs in it i could basically eat a much a i wanted and still lose weight this wa basically a miracle diet for me i made a list of food that i didn't want to go without found the one that had very very few carbs and just shoveled those thing into my face 24 7 in hindsight this wa really unhealthy but ultimately it got the ball rolling but the takeaway is keto initially worked for me because i wa able to continue feeding my glutton habit toward the end of 2019 i wa really beginning to crave carbs and would get sloppier and sloppier with takeout meal and cheat snack my rationale wa the more fat i eat the more carbs i can eat since really carb quota is based on percentage of total macro this led to more snowballing with the gluttony and i found myself eating massive amount of fat everyday to justify going up to 30 or 40 gram of carbs i'm not sure if this logic actually hold true for keto i didn't gain weight but i didn't lose weight either probably due to the sheer calorie in to calorie out ratio in the second half of 2019 i began to rely heavily on highly processed keto substitute what i call fake food product with wheat or milk protein isolate that mimicked puffy grain and cereal baked good such a cooky brownie and cake with fake sugar and almond coconut flour and substitute bread such a almond meal bread cloud bread and whatever voodoo magic thinslim's bread are made of at some point my diet consisted of 80 or more of these packaged keto substitute fake food and i wa barely even eating any veggie or meat once again my gluttonous tendency had taken over but this time i wa trying to just eat a much comforting processed easy to binge food a possible i didn't have an exit strategy my exit during january 2020 wa basically i miss carbs and i'm going to try to binge on them like crazy for a month to get the urge out of the way yeah right cadonana this wa dangerous self enabling excuse riddled talk i never thought ahead to what my regular diet might look like after i hit my goal weight or came off keto heaven know that the way i wa eating wa absolutely not healthy or sustainable despite the fact that i wa losing weight queue the pandemic welllllll old and constant friend gluttony let's see how we did absolutely just started eating my feeling and bingeing every processed comfort food in sight in mass quantity i'd run to the drug store in my ppe and clean out the kettle chip shelf once a week sometimes i'd sit in front of the tv and eat 2 bag of chip in one sitting rice ramen mac and cheese pizza oh my gosh i'm surprised i didn't get diabetes during the pandemic i wa also gluttonous in other way my retail therapy spending got out of control and i found my front door being piled with package of useless crap over the past year hello 2021 time for fresh start and healthier perspective well obviously something had had to change i had ballooned out to 140 lb again i wa no longer fitting the new wardrobe i had bought myself in 2019 my bank account wa drained i wa sleeping whenever possible just barely doing the thing i needed to it wa a pretty dark time for me i felt like crap physically and mentally january 1st came around and i resolved the next day i would stop shoveling mac and cheese into my piehole and start taking care of myself more here are the thing i did differently the second time around a mentioned before i wa pretty mad at myself and set an aggressive goal of 2 lb per week what really surprised me 3 month in is that i wa able to more or le stick to this so far i made a nifty chart see link below to track my progress and came up with some reward for myself i think this tracking chart actually helped my motivation immensely it's so satisfying when i hit a day where i can color in another block note that i also laminated the chart so i can erase progress in case i'm bad and gain weight again haha ironically my severe spending habit in 2020 helped me in a way in addition to starting up keto again i had put myself on a rather strict budget and saving goal for 2021 this helped me so much because i simply couldn't afford all those expensive pre packaged keto fake food that i had binged on so much in the year before i think the presence of really comforting yummy food in my cabinet really contributed to a binge addiction in 2019 for me i'm focusing now on simple meal 1 because i can't afford anything fancy or takeout right now and b i don't enjoy cooking and am too depressed don't otherwise have energy to sink into preparing a nice meal i think this in combination with the lack of packaged fake food ha really calmed down my so called glutton response every now and then i do some meal prep and create some very tasty complex keto dish some example are shirataki alfredo or paneer tikka masala however i found that eating these food completely triggered my glutton response on the day i made these meal for myself i would portion out enough for a whole work week but then eat it all in two day i just could not help myself with these more complex savory meal i would crave the flavor and the mouth feel so much that i literally could not stop myself from going back to the fridge for more in contrast if i eat a simple meal of lightly seasoned roasted or steamed veggie with some simply cooked chicken for example i would always be satisfied with the portion i originally set for myself the above 3 bullet point led me to realize that after all this time after the 17 lb i lost in 2021 and extreme self control i have exercised so far i still have an enormous psychological issue with food okay i know this wa pretty obvious in hindsight but i just couldn't define it well in my head maybe it's an addition to certain flavor or texture maybe it's trying to fill the emotional void i feel with delicious food but now that i realized that i'm going to avoid what i call complex meal highly seasoned and well textured until i can work with to figure out how to break the addiction i will begin to work with a therapist soon on these issue that being said i do treat myself with a small packaged keto brownie every day or other day if i can afford to get some that week but i make sure to get a bunch of one type at a time this way i get sick of having the same treat every single day and it reduces my urge to binge lol the last and what i think is most important point that i want to make is that it is so so so much easier to restrict calorie to a normal amount a opposed to bingeing thousand of calorie of fat when you are not tempting yourself with your addiction all the time cramming your face with fat all the time for sustained period is not the way to go like i did the first time sure the benefit of losing weight more quickly right now is great because i am eating balanced well keto balanced still eating that scoop of cream cheese at the end of everyday to get my fat macro in whole real food meal but i'm realizing this is just so much healthier i feel great i have energy i am happy with my weight loss but most importantly i believe now that i can transition from this to a sustainable permanent healthy lifestyle after i come off keto i have identified a major psychological issue that i am going to address which will help me sustain a new lifestyle after i hit my goal weight because let's be real life is better with carbs but i only deserve them if i can stop myself from out of control shoving them in my face and i believe i can achieve this next step and i think this is so important come up with an exit plan and permanent healthy maintainable lifestyle change for after i hit my weight goal let's be honest i love carbs this second round of keto ha made me realize that i can have a healthy lifestyle of enjoying carbs for the rest of my life and maintain the weight i want if i only address my binge eating issue i haven't come up with this plan yet but on my list is experimenting in the week and month after i exit keto to find out what my ideal maintain weight calorie macro are and factoring feeling good and having energy heavily into this aggressively working on my bingeing issue in talk therapy figuring out how to eat delicious food that i'm likely to binge without getting to that point fun and maintainable exercise a strength building routine and finding a type of cardio that i don't hate if you read all this thank you again sorry about the length and formatting organization i hope this help people regardless see picture of my progress and keto tracker here http imgur com a k1mex0m tl dr eat real whole food during keto don't cheat with fake sugar isolates rewarding occasionally is okay but be strict about how much you eat this will help you with portion control and listen to your body to actually know when to stop eating progress tracking chart are fun helpful and very motivational do some introspection and try to figure out your issue with food this helped me discover a huge psychological issue i have with bingeing food and i'm going to get help in therapy for it now now that i have discovered these thing i have so much hope that i can sustain a healthy diet after i hit my goal weight and enjoy carbs life in a healthy way 
1,still hungry and craving on day 4 hi i started keto a couple of day ago and have strictly eaten under 25 carbs af day no keto flu yet however i do feel more thirsty all the time and slightly fatigued but the kicker is that even though i eat full meal every day and even snack inbetween bell pepper and berry are a lifesaver i only eat a few berry a day i still feel oddly hungry yet satiated at the same time will this go away after some time or will it persist should i cut down more in carbs my spec are 1 70m 66 kg 19 y o male 
1,question about sugar v carb consumption so to start off i have read the faq several time and i haven't gotten a clear answer on how to calculate sugar versus how you calculate your carbs i know what net carbs are in term of carbs fiber net carbs how doe sugar equate into this is 1 gram of sugar equal to 1 gram of carbs an example is a meat stick i enjoy the nutrition label say this per stick 1g carb 0g fibre 1 gram sugar doe this mean that this meat stick is 2 net carbs i am not interested in knowing about the poly alcohol thing a i think i have a handle on that and i don't eat anything with fake sugar anyways thanks

1,family history of heart disease anyone hi there i could really use some of your experience here fir of all sorry in advance for any mistake english isn't my native language so it's my first time doing keto and i've been doing it for the last 10 day and i really love it it's the first time i actually feel happy while drastically changing my diet so i really really don't want to quit my clothes already feel a bit loose i feel my arm thinner and i'm much le bloated in general one thing i've noticed is that finally after month my workout are showing visible result so i want to stick with it a a lifestyle and not just a mean to an end the thing is i'm starting to worry because i have a history of hereditary heart disease heart attack stroke high cholesterol and hyperlipidemia my logic wa ok if a stick with keto i will be able to burn more fast than i did before so it's gonna be fine but that traditional approach of too much fat is bad for your heart it's starting to get to me because i definitely have been feeling my heart racing a lot while resting feeling kind of dizzy at time and also really hot sweating a lot and a bit shaky sometimes the doctor here follows in general this traditional approach so going to them with a family history of heart disease and doing keto seems like a no no that mean i'm pretty sure they are going to tell me to quit one uncle actually did it and the doctor said he wa destroying his liver and heart so i wanted to know if any of you have a similar experience while doing keto and if so what are some of the thing you can naturally expect also if some of you know of more updated study about fat and heart disease i've been searching but all i can find are those whose conclusion are too much fat is bad for the heart so any insight you have on this will be much appreciated thank you in advance

1,can your body build resistance hi all this is my second time doing strict keto i did it back in october of 2019 and lost about 35pounds it wa great this week i ve been getting back on it and sticking to le than 15 net carbs a day and counting calorie however i m a little discouraged i ve only lost 7 pound this week which ik is mostly water weight but when i did keto in october i lost about 12 pound a week is it possible for your body to hold onto the stored fat i m sure this is just a weird stall and that it s only been a week but any tip or advice is welcome 
1,it's working it's working anakin skywalker 29yom since march 1st i've gone from 258 8lbs to 247 6lbs i've also noticed a general increase in energy and drive to excercise i've gotten over the fake sweetener after taste in my low carb energy drink and a a type 1 diabetic i've noticed more regular glucose level with very few spike and today i learned chicharones are carb free fulfilling my urge for chip 
1,dropping weight to fast first post i'm a fatboy started losing weight november at 364 3lbs and two week ago when i started fasting i wa 339 4lbs my first week of fasting 16 8 and little carbs i lost 6 8lbs i decided to try keto because the book i read mentioned it go well with if and i lost 7lbs yesterday weigh in wa 325 8lbs is this ok i know most is water weight but it still weird to see 
1,third time doing keto a a type 2 diabetic i'm worried that it's too late i wa first diagnosed with type 2 diabetes about 4 year ago at the time i wa really afraid so i began researching the internet for the best diet to treat this disease which is when i first learned about keto i wa so impressed with the science behind it that i decided to give it a try and it worked it only took a day or two before i saw my glucose number drop to a normal range the combination of lchf along with intermittent fasting and regular exercise worked like a charm until i entered a long term depressive episode unrelated to keto and i stopped for about a year the second time on keto wa even better i managed to bring my a1c down from 12 to 5 6 then you guessed it i fell into another year long depression and stopped again i began a year long food indulgence spree and ate whatever i wanted whenever i wanted and now i fear the damage is too great to reverse last week i started to feel extremely weak it wa so concerning that i decided to check my blood sugar for the first time in over a year the number i saw on the glucometer shocked me 423 i knew it would be high but not that high it wa something i could no longer willfully ignore and decided immediately to stop this vicious cycle i wa putting myself through and return to keto at first everything seemed to be going in the right direction my blood sugar wa still high but in the 200s now instead of the 400s i began omad if my usual and moderate exercise basically the same routine i had done twice before that seemed to work well for me but after a full week of returning to a healthier lifestyle i'm starting to feel defeated i feel like the damage i've done to my body is too much and now it can't be fixed i just cannot get my blood sugar below 200 anymore before it wa so easy to do yesterday morning my glucose wa at 234 and after drinking coffee with a tablespoon of heavy cream it shot up to 320 this didn't make any sense to me how can zero carbs cause such a dramatic insulin spike this post is already way longer than i intended it to be so i'll just end it here i didn't really know where else to turn i feel like giving up because i feel like it's too late for me but at the same time i know keto is the best thing for me and i'm too scared to go to the doctor because i don't want to start taking insulin i wanted to fix this on my own but i no longer believe that i can 
1,keto while maintaining a calorie deficit doe anyone have tip on how to do low cal keto i feel like every recipe i find is either all bacon or all cheese which are both super high in calorie where are the resource for low cal healthy keto been doing keto for 1 5 month with no mess ups now

1,raw spinach and oxylates are they really that bad i like to use raw spinach a a base for a lot of sauce based dish almost like one would normally use rice or pasta or a tortilla it's super convenient low in carbs and seems like a fairly nutrient dense food a opposed to shirataki rice for example which ha nothing in it besides fiber and water however i m concerned a little bit about oxylates and their ability to chelate other mineral and remove them from your body i know that you can greatly diminish the oxylates by steaming or cooking but that diminishes the ease of use and i frankly don t like cooked spinach a much a raw but here s my question given the fact that spinach is so naturally high in mineral like iron magnesium etc i m wondering if the oxylates could be pretty much already be bound to plenty of mineral already so while maybe you aren t getting the full value of the iron from the spinach for example it s not like you are depleting other iron from what you are eating

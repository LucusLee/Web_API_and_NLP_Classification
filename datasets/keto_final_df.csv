Last year around March I've lost a job at the same time Covid shut down everything in my area, I spent a month in my bed browsing memes on the internet until I met someone who successfully lost around 100 pounds with keto. I was tired of being in my bed, in a situation I couldn't control and knew Covid would be the perfect opportunity to train hard, eat better and fix myself.
I've suffered from huge back pain for years and lost a lot of money on chiropractors when the only issue was my weight and lack of exercise. (I couldn't tie my shoes it was too painful to bend over but now I can rest the palm of my hands on the floor in that position !)

Time has come.

I hopped into the keto bandwagon and did intermittent fasting everyday. My diet was mostly made of fish, charcuterie, cheese, almond milk isolate shakes and lots of low carb veggies.
My appetite decreased over time like pure magic.
I cut down in half every portions of the amount of food i've used to eat and limited myself to three meals a day, sometimes two, no snacking. I also took potassium and magnesium supplements just in case.

To introduce myself to consistant exercise, I promised myself to do 30 mins a day of cardiovascular training, nothing else. Eliptical was my training of choice, then later I discovered a passion for jogging. I recently ran  a half marathon in 2 hours, I couldn't believe it. I still pinch myself to know if i'm dreaming or not.

I did that, only that from April 2020 to January 2021.
10 Months, went from 250lbs to 140lbs.
No excess, only 30 mins a day of jogging and a stable keto diet (with a cheat meal on Fridays for me.)

I must say I'm proud, happy and I can't believe it.
If I had to do it again I would certainly retake the challenge without hesitating.
Sadly, I saw a lot of people around me gaining a lot of weight during the quarantine and I truly hope my story will spark a little light of motivation in them.",True,False,False,keto,t5_2rske,2367608,public,self,Lost 110 pounds in less than a year !,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/mt5nmj/lost_110_pounds_in_less_than_a_year/,all_ads,6,success,a8bb6b80-abe7-11e8-8696-0ed9e0d77ef8,Success Story,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'cz5pbuY1vJFl9xGIcy2qEmgTPDY--3QDZJ1b-GWkrTs', 'resolutions': [{'height': 108, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/UCTr7lqOhRfUWRWNwvCHjt_j5NeCcpSHBTQOxSlavrU.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78fec3529db901a0cd5fbdd2a7e56733dba4865e', 'width': 108}, {'height': 216, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/UCTr7lqOhRfUWRWNwvCHjt_j5NeCcpSHBTQOxSlavrU.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=001b13e9600ce825d0a28473c709e0e362c66a33', 'width': 216}, {'height': 320, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/UCTr7lqOhRfUWRWNwvCHjt_j5NeCcpSHBTQOxSlavrU.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63e8dafc413e4bb2f1068783d8928063ffe51e63', 'width': 320}, {'height': 640, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/UCTr7lqOhRfUWRWNwvCHjt_j5NeCcpSHBTQOxSlavrU.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f4cd48df4d27d456bb4f03b1653da827312e9d0', 'width': 640}, {'height': 960, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/UCTr7lqOhRfUWRWNwvCHjt_j5NeCcpSHBTQOxSlavrU.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fce8cdba6d79bd83820dd7ecd245a8796f4e740b', 'width': 960}, {'height': 1080, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/UCTr7lqOhRfUWRWNwvCHjt_j5NeCcpSHBTQOxSlavrU.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=995dcee916a0b2571cae1fd865acb9e231c51a63', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 2048, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/UCTr7lqOhRfUWRWNwvCHjt_j5NeCcpSHBTQOxSlavrU.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=298bdedb1a823f265f0760ef7c6c10b12d0afc24', 'width': 2048}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,

Managed to keep it off with on-and-off lazy keto until falling off the keto wagon completely at the end of 2019. In the middle of 2020 I tried keto again but started experiencing GERD symptoms that were first misdiagnosed as sinus and asthma issues. In December a veteran ENT immediately recognized it as ""silent reflux"" aka GERD and told me to do an elimination diet: cut out all fatty and acidic foods, coffee, and carbonated drinks. The elimination diet helped until I came down with a terrible norovirus (stomach flu) over St. Patrick's Day this year; everything afterwards made my stomach hurt and nauseous as hell. Saw another random doctor - due to my PCP being overbooked - said my post-stomach flu issues was due to GERD and prescribed me to continue a bland diet and take 40mg PPI pills every morning. He also lectured me about my weight -- with neither advice nor a referral to a nutritionist -- which pissed me off.

While the meds have helped, my weight continues to creep up because a GERD-friendly diet is kryptonite to people with PCOS and insulin resistance. I love keto. I miss it. And I desperately need to get back to losing weight because it is wreaking havoc on my knees and ankles. This week I've been 75% immobile - only getting up to let my dog outside - because my knees are so swollen and stiff with obesity-related osteoarthritis. I am also tired all the time because my body can't handle the glucose from eating a bland diet, not to mention my hormones are out of whack. 

So in a nutshell: I feel like I am stuck between a rock and hard place having to choose between saving my esophagus or saving myself from type 2 diabetes. I know keto will help **my whole body** feel better but I don't want to disobey doctor's orders by starting keto again. What I want to know is if there are some people here who manage to do keto with GERD that can be managed with PPI drugs?

Four years ago I was 317. I am now 237. I lost the weight thanks to Keto. It’s the only thing that has ever worked. I’ve been between 236 - 241 for a year. My BMI is still in the 40’s so I certainly have more to lose. I monitor my ketones using finger prick blood testing. Typically I’m between 0.9 and 1.9. Most often right around 1.4. This seems average for me even when I was actively losing a lot of weight. On occasion it goes past 2.0 but not real often. 

I’ve tried so many little tweaks and nothing has made a difference. Most recently I slashed my protein in hopes that my liver was doing me wrong and converting protein to glucose. I do intermittent fasting, anywhere from 24 to 36 hours. Carbs are always 20 or under. I thought maybe my keto cheesecake wasn’t helping so I cut that out. I don’t need any keto sweets. I have pecans if I’m wanting a treat. On average my daily fat intake is about 80 grams.

Then after doing keto for around 2 months and rarely exercising I dropped almost 30 pounds total. 

But in the last 4 months I have barley lost any weight (5 pounds total). I haven’t changed anything that I was doing in the beginning. If anything I’ve made my diet better but I’m still not losing weight. I checked if I had ketones in my body today and the thing came back as negative. Even though I haven’t done anything that would be a reason why my body isn’t in ketosis. 

My diet nowadays consists of foods like almonds, cheese, mixed berries, bulletproof coffee, stevia, half and half, eggs, vegetables, chicken and beef. 

I’ve done my macros, I count calories, I count carbs, I don’t eat any sugar but I still don’t lose weight anymore and I don’t know what to do. 

If anyone has any suggestions on what I can do to lose weight please let me know.

Since you guys are electrolyte experts by default maybe you could figure this out. What would you say based on these symptoms and reactions to each supplements? I've tried to supplement and add foods in many different ways and nothing seems effective so far.

Overall symptoms: Brain fog, effort to breathe (only on rare occasions I ""forget"" I'm breathing, low energy overall, threshold crampy legs.

Sodium: Makes me feel just with a little more energy and less lightheaded for a short amount of time. Taking more won't help much. Serum is always around the mid-lower healthy range.

Potassium: Instantly kills any anxiety and makes my breathing smooth, lowers cramps. The effects are very short lived and reverse into worsening symptoms in a pretty short time. Taking too much irritates stomach, increases brain fog and makes me  dizzy and weak. Serum is always around the upper healthy range.

Magnesium: This is a real riddle. Magnesium takes a while to buildup in the body so it would make a lot of sense to assume I'm depleted, after all I haven't been supplementing throughout the lowest carb periods. But I can't tolerate it at all. As little as 260mg-400mg a day will increase sleepiness(will make me sleepy the next day even if I take it at night), cramps (yeah, literally a short while after taking my muscle will threaten to cramp at the next contraction), diarrhea, and brain fog. Tried most forms (glycinate, malate, threonate), threonate is the only one that won't give me diarrhea, but same side effects. Serum is on the lower healthy range which could indicate subclinical hypomagnesemia but I can't tolerate it. Go figure....

Calcium: probably have been on a pretty low intake for a long time based on what I eat. Had a vit D deficiency a while ago, but was corrected through supplements and reached normal levels.

And how can I ensure that I'm getting a quality MCT oil if I buy one online?

About me: I'm still relatively new to keto; I began the day after Thanksgiving last year and have been going great (with one 3-day period two weeks ago where I allowed myself to have carbs before returning to form).  I have lost 30 lbs since Thanksgiving 2020 (due in part to both keto and IF, not really exercising much yet); however, before my brief carb overload, I realized I was plateauing and not really losing much anymore.

So I started to finally keep track of my nutrient counts (I mostly just avoided eating anything with carbs, testing to ensure I never fell out of ketosis) and I realized that there are days when I have trouble getting my fat intake where it should be.  Don't get me wrong, for the most part, I have been nearly spot-on with my macros (60/30/10) without actually focusing on hitting those numbers for months, which I was surprised by, but there are days where it gets out of whack.  (Usually those are the days where I have chicken breast for dinner, as the protein/fat ratio throws things off a bit).

I decided to finally look into MCT oil, but as with everything, I don't trust any company's claims of being great.  I've seen far too much bullsh\*t... I usually go to Labdoor to check for their rating on supplements, but they don't seem to have MCT ratings.

From January 5th to today I’ve lost 34.2 lbs. / 15.5 kg (5'5"", 235.2 lbs. to 201.1 lbs.). The picture shows January 9th vs. April 10th. 

In the summer of 2019 I’d gotten down to 174 lbs. from 230 lbs., then my life situation changed, then Covid happened (excuses excuses, but I succumbed to them). By January of this year I’d regained everything plus 5 lbs., and was back at a point where the weight was getting physically uncomfortable. About half of the initial weight loss was from keto, and I wanted to get back into it because not has it been the easiest and most comfortable way to stay in a calorie deficit, I generally feel amazing on it.

Especially this past fall I struggled with getting half heartedly into it again and again, only to go off it way too easy. This resulted in slower (but still...) weight gain and feeling kinda hopeless. During a particularly indulgent December, and my feet hurting a lot after work days (fairly active job), I started to prepare mentally for a different January. Seeing photos from New Years Eve was the cherry on top and I was looking forward to taking back control. 

It’s now been over 3 months back on keto, and I generally feel better than I did all of 2020. I know motivation is unreliable, but it’s still here in full force and I take advantage of it the best I can. I didn’t start out with any exercise goals beside collecting a bunch of steps on my Fitbit. Only very recently did I start c25k as I felt a genuine wish to sweat more. 

I try to stay at 20g carbs or under, allowing up to 25g if need be. The past 1.5 months I’ve incorporated IF and some 36 hr fasts and found that I absolutely love it, so that will definitely be a part of my journey going forward. This was not necessary for me to be successful with keto or weight loss at all, I was most interested in all the other benefits. Still, I didn’t expect it to suit my lifestyle as well as it has. I know I would never have bothered with this if I wasn’t already eating keto. 

Sorry for this little wall of text, I just wanted to contextualize and explain what I've been doing.

At the end of Last year, i decided to start Keto again and lose weight.  It has been going well thus far, but i believe progress is relatively slow, and i think i might be doing something wrong somewhere.  So, i am here looking for advice into what i can do to improve the situation! :D

&amp;#x200B;

My start point and end point are as follows:

Sepetember 2020: 124.5 Kg at 43.1 BMI

As of Today, April 17 2021: 99.4 Kg at 34.4 BMI

&amp;#x200B;

So, about 8 months to lose 25.1 Kg.  

&amp;#x200B;

While i am happy i lost weight at all, i think this might be too slow.  I am aware my body could just be a slower model lol, but i am hoping some of you fine individuals could help me improve this \^\_\^

I am going for the following macros ideally:

5% Carbs

25% Protein

70% Fat

1500 Calories

&amp;#x200B;

Usually, i stay just under the macros, but sometimes i exceed a bit depending on meal.  But i have did my best to adhere to this as best as possible.  My main issue is staying under the CALORIE limit to reach my fat goal.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, i have rambled on long enough!  Any insight into how i could improve would be amazing!

I often see the recommendations to limit protein intake to a maximum of 25-35 g per meal, as this is what the body is able to utilize for muscle synthesis and that excess protein may be unproductive to ketosis, as it will convert to glucose.   


And yet, as someone attempting to gain muscle mass by bodyweight training, while eating two meals a day within an 8 hour window. Eating only 25-35 g of protein per meal seems sort of silly, if no detrimental to progress.

I hope it gives someone out there the motivation they need to find the lifestyle that works best for them, keto or not.

My first weight loss journey in 2013 was based on calorie restriction and cardio. I paid no mind to macros since I didn’t know what a macro was... I just focused on eating healthy foods and made sure I had a big calorie deficit while hitting the gym for 45 minutes a day. I lost 30 pounds in 3 months. I was stuck at 166 pounds for about a week before I became so discouraged, I gave up. I hit a plateau and didn’t know how to break it. Instead of being patient and trying to work through it, I went back to my old bad habits.

My second weight loss journey was in 2018. I had hit 209 pounds on the scale... my heaviest ever, outside of being 230 pounds when i was 9 months pregnant with my son. NOPE! I started a low fat diet. That, working 2 fairly active full-time jobs, AND going to the gym, helped me shed 47 pounds in 4 months. My progress went downhill when I switched to 3rd shift at one of my jobs. I was stuck at 162 pounds and didn’t have the patience to break through the plateau. I didn’t give up on myself immediately this time, but I lost it over time and ended up gaining all but 5 pounds back within the next few years.

Here we are. Round 3. Sitting at 204 pounds and struggling to stay awake past 6:30pm every day, I knew changes had to be made. I joined and followed social media groups for the top trending lifestyle: Keto. I read through so many progress posts and most people have done so well with it. I decided to look into this way of life a little more and read about carb restriction. The ONE thing I haven’t yet targeted! I then stumbled upon an article about carb sensitivity and the warning signs. I will be damned. I relate to every single sign. That day I discovered that I really need to limit my carbs and I decided that Keto is probably best for me, personally. 

I started this journey 2 and a half months ago in February and I’m already down almost 40 pounds. This time, with minimal exercise and working only one job. With this new diet, paired with intermittent fasting, there is no doubt in my mind that I will finally make it through the 160’s and maybe even reach my ultimate goal of 145 pounds. A goal that I have repeatedly failed to achieve for 7 years now. With the knowledge and experience I have this time around, I WILL succeed. Only 20 more pounds to go. The last 20.

Also the veggies and the stuff required for keto is expensive and I don't like sea food. 

Yesterday I ate some boiled egg with tomato, cucumber and lemon.

My primary motivation for doing so is to boost my focus, in addition to all the other health benefits.  Long story short, I quit caffeine and nicotine about a year and a half ago but my focus dropped off a cliff.  To make up for it I thought I'd try a real keto diet (not just low carb) and I take some nootropics like Lion's Mane and L-Theanine. I manage to stay well below 20 net carbs per day and I intermittently fast using the 16/8 method. I can happily say that the combination of Keto + Nootropics has brought my focus back to the point where I can code (I'm a web developer) long hours into the night like I used to before I quit all forms of caffeine.

The downside to all this however is that since the first few days on Keto I have developed a persistent non-stop muscle twitch. It is mostly in both my legs (thighs, knees, and calfs), my feet, and occasionally my arms and eyelid. None of it is localized, it appears to be random, and I can always feel it at rest (so hundreds of times a day). All signs and everything I could read up on pointed towards an electrolyte imbalance (had a brief few days where I was certain it was MS or ALS lol). I decided to experiment and started taking a liquis magnesium supplement. The twitches subsided big time, although not disappear completely. To test my hypothesis further after a few weeks of taking the magnesium supplement I stopped just to see what would happen. What happened was my muscle twitches ramped back up from 10 to 100, and got as bad as they were when. I first started Keto. 

Having said all that and noticing the correlation between the twitches, and taking the magnesium supplement and not taking it, my question for you fine educated folks is ""at what point do I stop taking the magnesium?"" I can almost say for a certainty that the difference in twitches is huge between when I'm taking it and not. Is there any other electrolyte supplement I should be looking out for to help with the twitches as well?  If these supplements are indeed helping with the twitches and they come back when I'm not taking the supplements, is there a point in Keto where the electrolytes will balance itself out and the twitching will stop?

I need advice from y'all. It's pretty much what the title sounds like. I have been doing keto for a little over a month now and have a bachelorette weekend to go to next weekend. Friday night, we are staying in the cabin and cooking dinner; I've decided that worst case scenario, I will have a shake or eggs for dinner if I can't eat what is offered. My issue comes on Saturday; I already do IF so I am not planning on eating breakfast with the rest of the crew (I will just order a hot tea or something). BUT for lunch we are going to a popular taco place (White Duck Taco in Asheville, for those of you in the area). I have been scouring their website for nutrition info but they literally do not post anything (UGH). I think I can get away with the fish taco in lettuce with pico de gallo and avocado crema (but without their nutrition facts, I really can't track macros). I also was looking at the ceviche as an option. ALSO, I have no idea where we are going to dinner so I really can't plan in advance, but might just pick a salad or if they have a protein then doing that. My issue is, I really don't know how many hidden carbs are in any of these things! Has anyone had success on travels like this? Looking for advice, anecdotes, or any hacks that y'all have to offer! I really do not want to break my keto streak!

I'm off my blood pressure meds, and I'm no longer pre diabetic. My bloodwork has been awesome!

However, I've found that I have diverticulosis, and recently I had an attack of diverticulitis (basically an infection and massive bloating, swelling, etc...). I believe that it was due to eating some miracle noodles (basically straight up indigestible fiber) and more veggies than I usually have for our family's special Valentine's day weekend.  I was put on antibiotics and a scan confirmed diverticulitis. It was a few horrible days of feeling like there was a football in my gut, but it seemed to heal up rather quickly by fasting (just beef or chicken broth) for about 3 days. Then slowly adding in some basic foods like eggs and ground beef with salt only. 

Feeling pretty normal again 7 weeks later, I ate some dolmades (sausage stuffed grape leaves) and cauliflower falafel on Easter. They were all home made and keto, even the sausage. The falafel was made with cauliflower rice. But once again I had more very high fiber veggies than I usually do and started building up to an attack 9 days later. It wasn't quite as bad as the first time because I had a better understanding of what was going on and went to the Dr for antibiotics ealier, but it sure isn't what I would call fun.

I am back on fasting for the last 3 days. I've only had about 4 cups of broth each day along with water, and I'm supplementing with electrolytes and salt. I'll start on a few eggs per day over the next week and slowly work my way back.

Has anyone had success with fighting off diverticulitis with keto or carnivore? What was your experience? I feel I can track it down to days that I had high fiber stuff and probably over ate a little bit on holiday occasions. But I'm interested to know if others have had other experiences?

I work a blue collar job and I struggle with it now. I used to powerlift so I have a bunch of muscle on my frame. I'm currently on Atorvastin for cholesterol and have been for a long time, testosterone cypionate every two weeks for hypogonadism, and I take beta blockers 10mg when I have to because I get anxious driving now because I'm afraid to get spacey in traffic. And as of 5 weeks ago my doctor started me on Metformin 500mg twice a day.

I am seeing an endo and she put me on metformin just to try it because she can't come up with anything else. We have done blood work after blood work. The only thing it showed recently was my RBC count was getting a little high. My fasting cortisol and insulin have been normal. I have had chest and head xrays and MRI's and they found nothing. I have seen a neurologist and he found nothing. 

So I came across a post on r/Brainfog touting the effectiveness of going full keto if you suspect you have hyperinsulinemia. I went ahead and did this in August. By day 3 all of my symptoms were gone. No more lightheadedness 2 hours after eating. No more never ending cycle of needing to eat. It was heaven. I was able to drink alcohol again with no long term effects. I lost 11 lbs and was down to 259. I was bike riding occasionally during this and that didn't affect me like it used to. That lasted 5 weeks. Then all of symptoms came back. Not as aggressive but I'd say 75% of what they were. 

Since then my doc gave me a Dexcom BS monitor to try. During the first 10 day run my BS was perfect. Now I'm doing this second run and I've introduced working out. My symptoms are growing worse. Any time I do any weight lifting I am starving for the next 3 days. Nothing fixes my hunger, I'm extremely lightheaded. I did 4 sets of squats along with some cardio on Wednesday and ate a sensible keto dinner after. Yesterday I felt the worst I've felt in years. No food satiated my hunger. Last night I went to bed with a headache. I feel my body retaining water. My BS monitor showed my BS bounced up and down all night. Anywhere from 131 to 86. The previous 10 day cycle showed nothing like this. 

I feel awful the next day if I go over my 30 carbs the previous day.
I'm not losing any weight like I did the first 2 weeks. Everyone says losing weight will help but whenever I restrict eating all my symptoms come back harder than ever. 

My questions are this: could this be an adrenal issue? Could weightlifting be triggering it somehow? Should I take a break from keto? I keep hoping to get anther 5 weeks like I had in the beginning. Is this just hyperinsulinemia like I suspect? Are there any other tests I can request?  Any help is greatly greatly appreciated.

I've been always a *sports kind of guy* through high school and early twenties. However after 25, I started to gain weight. Slow at first and probably some can relate that each time I was on the scale, you say to yourself *this isn't that bad...*. If you keep doing this, get less active because of a hectic professional and personal life and include eating out, or choosing fast-food instead of cooking up something decent, it adds up pretty fast.

Fast-forward to the present, at 38, and the weight scale showed a scaring 102 kg (224 pounds). Now before I had tried keto, with success. The first time I saw that I was going to +100kg, I managed to get it back down to 94kg (207 pounds). Which is still too heavy since I'm 1m75 (5 feet 8 57⁄64 inches) but I was on a roll, right? Then Covid happened.

Seated at home, permanently but lucky enough to still have work, bread and pastas were within arms reach and I started to gain weight again and an alarming rate until present day.

Having failed to stick to a keto lifestyle, since we all know it's not a diet, I decided that I needed guidance.

## Pronokal

I'm not sure how popular or familiar people are with the Pronokal method but in Belgium it's a *kind of* diet under the supervision of a doctor. Every two weeks I check in, measurements are taken and every four weeks my blood gets tested.

The diet consists of Pronokal products of their own, combined with 400 grams (1 1/2 cups) of largely green vegetables (very restricted which ones are allowed). Once you reach a certain target weight, you progress to the next step where you'll replace some of their own products with lean meat or chicken for instance.

At the end, you should be eating more or less keto-ish. I know or believe they re-introduce carbs into the diet as well at some point but I'm far from that moment in time. The doctor checkup continues up until two years after your last step to make sure you made the correct food adaptions and don't relapse.

A lot of questions remain to be answered but it seems that I really need the doctor follow-up to motivate me and to continue.

## Progress

I started this new *adventure* on March 15th, at 102kg (224 pounds) and the scale this morning after a month indicated 90,7kg (199,95 pounds) so that's a loss of about **11 kg (24 pounds)** in one month.

I'm sure the weight loss will slow down after this initial step 1 once I introduce different kind of foods again.

## Surprises

I'm really surprised that I don't miss the carbs, sugars, etc. I used to *really* enjoy food. Having two plates of pasta and ice cream afterwards. Eating lots of bread each day and drinking *zero* beverages. I was afraid I'd miss all those. Don't get me wrong, we're a family of four and I'm the only one on *a diet*. It's not difficult but sure the smell of french fries with steak from the other people in the family smells delicious. But I think a key factor to  the success of *this* and keto in general, is that there are no cravings. I'm full after eating, feeling full for a long time and **mental clarity** is insane.

I used to be one of those people that would forget *anything* unless I wrote it down in some todo-list or a notes app. Right now, I remember work-related discussions from four weeks ago like they happened yesterday.

My consult with the surgeon is next Wednesday and I’ve been trying to watch the fat. I tested a small sandwich with some mayo and cheese, which gave me another attack. After 3.5 hours I gave in and took the percocet I was given. I can apparently handle a few grams at a time spread out over the day, but I can’t eat at all like I was.

I am so frustrated. I’ve been doing so well and now I’ve eaten lucky charms out of frustration because it tastes good and doesn’t make me hurt. I just want eggs or nuts or a burger or butter on my veggies.

Now the reason I discontinued keto last 2 times was largely because of my inability to have meat (chicken, lamb) on a daily basis. I also got an allergy test done and figured I am allergic to eggs. So the only options for me to do a pure keto is either to have salads everyday or meats every meal which is something too hard for me to continue in the long term. 

I am wondering if someone can guide me on a keto plan for vegetarians. Also, if I follow the 36 hour fasting protocol properly, is it fine to have lentils (50g carbs 20g protein) adding butter to it with some whole wheat bread, once or twice a week?

So the numbers and data it is registering is for the last 5 weeks only.  (In total, I have lost 17 lbs since starting keto on Feb 10, 2021).

I wish I'd had this scale from the beginning.  It's really great, and tells me all kinds of info.  How many pounds of water is in me, how much muscle, how much subcutaneous fat, what my BMI is, etc.  Today I finally noticed something else, and that was that it is telling me how many pounds of FAT I've lost since I started using the scale.  It came to 2.9 lbs.  Of fat.  Gone.  Used up!  

My mom told me today I have strong keto breath.  I've been eating a lot of meats, (steaks! yum!), cheese, eggs, (God, so many eggssssss!), above ground veggies and pork rinds coated in butter, coconut oil, and natural peanut butter, nuts, and avocados.  I'm not watching my macros, because it's too difficult for me, and I'm trying to keep my calories under 1200 a day--  and I think I'm doing that, because most days I only eat one meal maybe two.  I've been doing IF without realizing it, so I know I'm doing this well.  I have not 'cheated' once since starting this.  I've got to lose weight for two foot surgeries, so I am SERIOUS.

Does it sounds correct to you guys, that out of 9 lbs, nearly 3 of those were fat?  I try to get on this scale every day, first thing in the morning. The more you use it, the more info it saves and adjusts and tells you.  It's pretty darn cool.  I didn't notice the info about the fat until today, because I'm legally blind, and it's really hard to see my iPhone and all of the data it is gathering. 

So--  thoughts?  If this scale is correct, it's saying 1/3 of the weight I've lost is actual fat.  Should the percentage be higher?  What is the other 2/3 made of?

As always, I urge you to read this sub's FAQ. It's been my rock and I'm not even exaggerating.

I basically summarized the FAQ plus my own little interventions:

* Try to keep your carbs under 20 a day but if you do go over, don't let it derail you, just keep them as low as you can for the rest of the day.
* Lean into protein. Make sure you're getting at least 100 grams a day even if you need to go over your deficit calories to get there.
* Drink ketoade and use salt on your food. (I gave her the FAQ recipe)
* Weigh and track your food as much as you can. Again, if you can't, don't let it derail you. Do your best and keep going. 
* Use a food tracker all the time, every day. If you stop, start again when you can. (She uses CarbManager, I did, but now use Cronometer.)
* If there is something you really want and will feel deprived and resentful without it, make sure you're already full (if you can) and have one bite of the thing. Count it as 5 carbs (it probably won't be that much) and then get rid of the rest. The first bite is always the best anyway.
* Be kind to yourself. This is not a punishment. It's not that you ""can't have carbs,"" it's that you don't want them. 
* If you stop eating keto you're not cheating. You're just not eating keto. It will be there when you're ready to come back to it. 

That's pretty much it. When she's had questions I've answered them. She told me she's gone off keto sometimes, but always gotten back on with the next meal.

In this article, you will gain insights into the myths and facts surrounding the Ketogenic diet.

**What Is Exactly Is a Keto Diet?**

The Keto diet works on the principle that by depleting carbohydrates, you will burn fat for fuel, hence maximizing weight loss. It entails a gradual reduction of carbs intake and replacing it with fats.

**Keto Diet Myths/Facts**

Here are the common Keto diet myths and facts.

**Myth 1:** You Can Consume Any Fat

**Fact:** When practicing Ketogenic, people consume healthy fats. If you want to keep fit, avoid saturated fats, and focus on organic foods rich in fiber. To prevent any stomach discomfort, space out the quantity of your daily fat intake.

**Myth 2**: Weight Loss is the Only Benefit of Keto Diet

Fact: Contrary to what many believe, the Keto diet has immense benefits other than weight loss. For instance, it enhances cognitive function, boosts gut health, regulates body hormones, and stabilizes blood sugar levels.

**Myth 3:** You Don't Need to Exercise

Fact: Exercising is highly recommended when you are on a Keto diet. However, to achieve more out of workouts, ensure you eat adequately, and allow enough time for recovery. To exercise, you may need more carbs, and it is essential to up your carb consumption on workout days.

**Myth 4:** Your Muscle Mass Will Reduce

Fact: As opposed to the myth, people who follow the diet while doing strength exercises gain muscles.

**Myth 4:** It Is Characterized By Fatigue

**Fact:** During the adjustment period of the diet, you may feel tired, but that condition will diminish with time. More importantly, not everyone experiences fatigue during dieting. However, if you encounter it, bear in mind that it won't last beyond a week.

**Myth 5:** The Diet is for a Short Period

Fact: The duration of the diet intake depends on your health and fitness goals. In most cases, the standard period is between three to five months. After this phase, you may revert to your regular eating patterns for some weeks.

**Myth 6:** There is no Science behind the Diet

Facts: Several scientific studies support the Ketogenic diet. For instance, particular research shows that the diet was initially created to help epileptic patients regulate seizures. Additionally, the diet helps reduce or maintain body weight.

**Myth 7:** Rich in a Lot of Fats and Proteins

**Fact:** The diet doesn't contain high fats and proteins. Depending on one's training goals, the macronutrient is apportioned based on individual requirements. For example, the typical macronutrient split for this diet includes low carbs, high fat, and moderate protein.

**Myth 8:** Causes Heart Attack

**Fact:** Keto diet encompasses the intake of saturated fats, which doesn't cause a heart attack.

**Final Thoughts**

Hello! I came here to get some clarification and confirmation of my understating of energy source management.

Say, *a carb-burner* decides to go keto. Carb-burner's primary source of fuel is carbs (aka glycogen). Once carbs (glycogen) is depleted from muscles and liver reserves, his body will start switching to fat-burning. Once he went through 100 rounds of hell of keto flu, his body is learning to adapt to using fat for energy (on the condition that carb-burner stops eating carbs). 

And we have *a fat-burner* \- a fat-adapted person, ketoing for months. A fat-burner's primary source of fuel is fat.  (Although he relies on fat mostly throughout the day/night to give him energy, after he ate, he will still have a glucose spike. Depending on food he ate, the spike will either be steep up and steep down (if he ate a bagel for e.g.) or the spike will be more like a hill (if he ate 3 eggs for e.g.). But he will still have an increase in glucose levels-&gt; meaning that this glucose will go into muscles and liver --&gt; **meaning that he will be relying on glucose for some time after food intake**. 

HERE COMES THE QUESTION(S) --&gt;) 

Now, about this last bit of the sequence - as his glucose goes up, his ketones go down. **(1)** Does this mean that he switches to using glycogen as the energy source until his glucose goes down/ketones go up? OR he keeps using fat as the energy source and carbs that he ate will go into reserves. **(2)** Is there a ""max capacity"" of glucose reserves? If his reserves are full (from previous food intake e.g.), what happens with the carbs he ate during the meal?

So, I'm my understanding, being fat-adapted effectively means managing your glucose levels. After you ate, you restore glycogen and use it as fuel until next meal. After few hours your glucose goes down/ketones go up and you start using fat for fuel, then you eat again and this circle goes on until you go to sleep. Effectively, following the above piece, you actually have a prolonged period of burning fat **only** after your last meal (e.g. dinner). When you practice Intermittent Fasting (IF) (with a lunch &amp; dinner regimen), you will use fat for fuel only during the night and until your lunch next day. Question number **(3)** \- does this mean that if you do **not** follow intermittent fasting and consume something 3-5 times a day (doesn't have to be full meals but something that breaks your fast), you effectively always use glycogen as fuel rather than fat because your glucose goes up and down and you do not give your ketones a chance to ""override"" glucose? Following the above - an IF is a must on keto because otherwise you just do not use fat for fuel other than at night. Here is where I am struggling to understand fat-adaptation. 

To the title of this post - is fat-adaption all about glucose management as written above? 

I hope its clear what I mean and would appreciate your takeaway on the glucose management situation :)

Firstly let me say, I call it relapsing because as a recovering alcoholic and drug addict, I know when I want something vs when I’m clucking for it. I’m a year and two weeks sober, and in replacement of the sauce and sparkle I used food. I’m now 5’7 and 92kg. Long and short, the floor boards squeak. 

I have been on keto for two weeks. I’ve logged my food, I’ve nailed my cooking and I have absolutely bloody loved it. Yoga everyday, walk everyday, building up little by little to the healthiest me. 

But today I had a vision of getting a massive cake with icing (I saw it on TV - the type of cake you want to buy a drink and lick all over) and I wanted to stick a fork in it and eat it until I felt sick and bin the rest. I don’t even like cake. It was never my thing but I had that addict twinge. I knew sugar was going to be tough to ditch but after you’ve given up cocaine and champagne, sugar was the lesser of two evils... so I thought.

I realised recently if I kept giving in to sugar, pretty soon I was going to give in to alcohol again. If I can’t acknowledge and address these addict ticks that set me off and cut them off, I’m going to relapse. 

So I turned back around. I stopped walking to my local bakery, turned around and came back home. Made an enormous cup of camomile tea and meditated.

Almost every person in this world is concerned about the extra weight of their body. Thus they are trying their level best to get rid of the extra pounds and they are adopting several ways to reach their target. Some are taking the route of hard exercising, some are going through [yoga](https://www.fitex.club/embrace-your-body-with-3-yoga-poses/). But there is another way through which you can get rid of the extra fats of your body. Here you need to adjust your diet plan a bit and increase the intake of protein food by reducing the carbohydrates. During this diet plan, you will be given a very little amount of carbohydrates and the same will be replaced by fat and protein. Since you are reducing the carbohydrate intake in your body, it will get to a metabolic state which is named Ketosis.

**What Is a** [**Keto Diet**](https://www.fitex.club/what-are-the-dangers-of-the-keto-diet/)**?**

A question may arise about what is a Keto diet. Normally a person takes 50 to 60% of the carbohydrates of his daily meal. But in the case of the Keto diet, you cannot consume that much carbohydrate. As carbohydrate is the main source of energy of our body, it protects the fat content to generate energy in the body. While you reduce the consumption of carbohydrates drastically, the body breaks down the fat cells to make the necessary energy for its physical and physiological works. During the Keto diet, you can only take 30 to 50 grams of carbohydrates so that the blood [sugar](https://www.fitex.club/unhealthy-fat-deposits-around-heart-from-too-much-sugar/) level does not fall and you don’t get sick. The required energy of the body will be generated by oxidizing the fat cell and it will cause you to shred the excess amount of fat in your body. In a Keto diet plan, almost 50% of the meal contains protein and the rest are made of fat and the least amount of carbs. People who want to shred their extra pounds quickly and effectively can adopt this diet plan. Basically, a Keto diet plan is for a month after that you will have to take a short break of nearly one week and then again you can go for the second phase of your Keto diet plan.

A Ketogenic diet is basically a form of diet that does not have the responsibility to give you proper health. It is only used to lose weight early. People who are suffering from cardiac problems, certain brain diseases, and have problems with acne are advised to stay away from this kind of diet. Since the heavy fat content can increase the problems as well. Though this diet is all about reducing the intake of carbohydrates it eventually increases the intake of fat through different foods like butter, oil, and cheese. This is why you require taking proper advice from your doctor as well as a diet expert on whether you can go for this diet plan or not. Without knowing the proper ways of adapting to this diet plan can cause you heavy harm. Eventually, there are some side effects of this diet, and people who are capable of tolerating these things can go for or other specific kinds of diet plans.

**Preparation Before You Start a Keto Diet**

Changing to a different type of diet system requires some preparation of the body. You can’t switch over to a different kind of food plan suddenly as the body requires getting adapted with it. First of all, you need to start with the basics of the Keto diet. It may cause you some uncomfortable moments first up but slowly and gradually it will get adjusted. Since the Keto diet is targeted to reduce the carb intake in your daily meal, there will be less than 30 grams of carbs daily in your diet. The lack of carbs will be fulfilled by the intake of fats. As carbs are the sources of energy for the physiological and physical functions of the body, you require some substitute to cover the lack. Fat is a very good source of energy in the body and in absence of carbs, it will oxidize to generate energy in your body. So your meals should be filled with meat, cheese, nuts, oilseeds, eggs, and other sources of fats. The same amount of fat gives double energy than that of carbs and thus you need to put some low-calorie vegetables in your daily meal.

During the Keto diet, you should keep some important aspects of it in mind. You will not get that much low-carb food here and there and thus you need to carry your snacks wherever you are going. It will cause you a sense of unfulfillment many a time after you eat meals as carbs help to secrete the hormone that gives you the signal that you are done with your food. Taking too much protein diet will definitely cause you some change in the chemical as well as fluid balance in your body. It will also affect the balance of minerals in your body too. There you may have to take enough salt as well as electrolytes from outside too to keep your body hydrated. If you want your Keto diet to work faster, then you can use some Keto salt supplements too. There may be several obstacles in your road to [weight loss](https://www.fitex.club/healthy-weight-loss-diet-within-budget/) through the Keto diet, but you need to stay focused and not lose hope.

**Things That You Can Take during Your Keto Diet**

Since you are not taking carbs in ample amounts, you need to take such foods that will keep you filled. Without a proper amount of food you may feel starving as well as due to lack of satisfaction after eating, you may have mood swings as well. So here are some of the best foods that you can eat during your Keto diet.

**1. Meat**

Meat is a very good source of protein. It will help you to build your muscles and shred extra fats in your body. There are varieties of meat that are available in the market. Most people who are on the journey of weight loss try to avoid red meat like mutton, beef, pork, and so on. But here in the Keto diet, you can easily go for all kinds of meats. In other weight-loss diets, the experts recommend only boiled meat so that no extra oil can get in. but in this case, you can go for your favorite dishes made of chicken or mutton or beef and no one is going to stop you since along with protein, you also need ample amounts of fat too.

**2. Fish**

Sea fishes can be very good sources of high protein and essential fatty acids. They are actually very tasty and are very good for heart health. On the other hand, it will provide the necessary amount of protein as well as fat content required for the Keto diet plan. Salmon, tuna, mackerel, trout can be very good options for those who are going through their Keto diet plan.

**3. Dairy Products**

Milk and dairy products are very essential in this case of diet. Milk contains almost all kinds of micro-nutrients which are really necessary. It also will give you some amount of carbs along with fat too. Other than that, cheese, butter, and creams can be beneficial for the person going through the Keto diet.

**4. Nuts and Oilseeds**

These are very important parts of the Keto diet since they contain essential fat contents for your health. Almonds, walnuts, cashew, peanut along with flaxseed, pumpkin seeds are very healthy ingredients in Keto diets. You can take them through your meal as they will provide you the necessary amount of good fats to keep your internal organs healthy.

**5. Vegetables**

Filled with vitamins and minerals, vegetables are very much needed for those who are going through the Keto diet. Vegetables will keep your stomach full and the dietary fibers present in them will definitely keep your stomach healthy. Vegetables of different colors will provide you different types of vitamins as well as minerals too. On the other hand, they will give you some amount of carbohydrates as well. If you are looking for some change of test of your mouth, then these veggies will definitely provide you with a different kind of test.

**Foods That You Should Avoid during the Keto Diet**

When you are going through a Keto diet you need to take proper food enriched in protein and fat but the only thing you should avoid is carbohydrates. Most of the snacks available in the market are full of carbohydrates. Though there are different types of carbohydrates, still the snacks are mostly made of simple carbs that get into the body and assimilate easily to release energy. This is why they get digested quickly and you feel hungry soon after you finish the snacks. Some of the foods that you should strictly avoid if you are going through your Keto diet plan are mentioned here.

The first thing that comes on the list is bread and bakery foods. Bread is one of the steady foods of our [daily life](https://www.fitex.club/this-is-how-you-can-incorporate-healthy-activities-into-your-daily-life/). It is a good source of carbohydrates that helps you to generate energy for all your works. This is why consuming bread and bakery products, diet crackers, cookies are strictly forbidden in the Keto diet plans. The second thing that should be avoided is sweet and sugary foods. Sweets are full of sugar and sugar is the finest form of carbs. This is why you need to avoid sugar and sweet foods very strictly. Sweetened beverages contain a high amount of sugar so you need to stay away from soda, different kinds of packaged fruit juices, sweetened tea, and soft drinks.

On the other hand Spaghetti, noodles, wheat, rice, cereals, potatoes, corn, peas, pumpkin, black beans, chickpeas, citrus fruits like oranges, grapes, pineapples, and most importantly alcoholic drinks should be avoided if you want to get your body fat free really. There are different kinds of fats too that you should not consume during your Keto diet like margarine, vegetable oils, and so on when you are taking protein as the major contributor to your meal you should definitely try to have fresh meat. Processed and packaged meat is very much unhealthy and will disturb your goal of losing weight.

So far we were discussing the foods that we should avoid during the Keto diet plan. But there are some foods that we can easily take. These foods contain healthy fat in good proportion and thus you can consume them to keep your body healthy. There are some supplements that you can take like exogenous Ketone supplements. This is nothing but some extra amount of Ketones that you provide to your body from outside. Medium-chain triglycerides give the Ketones a boost to keep your body healthy.

They are also beneficial in terms of losing weight, gaining energy for your daily works as well as they help in digestion also. There are some snack options too for the people who are going through the Keto diet. Almonds and cheese are very good sources of healthy fat for the body. Avocado with chicken salad, unsweetened coconut, nuts and seeds, half-boiled eggs, olives, and salami berries can be good snack options for you so that you don’t feel starved while you are traveling or you are out of your home for a longer period of time.

**Benefits of Keto Diet**

1. The lower the number of carbs in the diet, the lower the appetite will be. The experts say that sugary and carbohydrate foods increase the appetite. Hunger is the enemy of your diet plan and thus if you will go for a Keto diet, then you will feel less hungry.

2. While you will lower the number of carbs in your meal, it will cause drastic weight loss at the start of the diet plan. As we all know that carbs are the fuel of our body and thus while there is less supply of carbs in the body, it will use the fat to generate the energy for the physical or physiological works of the body. This will cause faster shredding of fats from the body.

3. Like in nature, in our body also, there are different types of fats available. There are different sites where the fats are stored. The risk of health is thus determined by the deposition of the fats inside the body. Mostly the fats deposited in the lower abdomen are very harmful. This fat is very rigid and thus is the reason for obesity. While you lower the number of carbs in your diet, you will notice that the fat stored in the lower abdomen is getting shredded very fast. The fat which is used to generate energy in absence of carbs is generally supplied from this portion of the body.

4. While you lower the amount of carb intake in your body, the triglyceride content of the blood falls. It is the fat molecules that move through the body along with the blood through the blood vessels. Thus it reduces the risk of different diseases and you can stay safe from the dangers of blockage of the blood vessels.

5. High-density lipoprotein is a very healthy fat content of the body. While you decrease the amount of carb intake, it gradually increases the HDL level in the body. It keeps the heart healthy and protects the other organs from danger.

6. As soon as you decrease your intake of carbs, it causes a lower level of sugar in your blood. Lower sugar level thus causes lowering the insulin levels. The Keto diet is thus very helpful for those who have blood sugar.

I think I have been counting my net carbs incorrectly. I have been logging all food intake into Fitbit, the below are my results from yesterday.

I am losing weight at a good pace, a bit concerned about losing muscle mass, but my main issue is that I have been subtracting Fiber from Carbs as you see above (yesterday was 9.9 Net Carbs) but I have some conflicting information that the nutrition labels in the UK are Net for the line that reads 'Total Carbs' - does anyone have any further information on this or can confirm its true?

I would like to give keto a try, and I've read a bunch of general things now, as well as reading through the food list with accepteble foods for keto.

So 5% carbs, 35% protein, 60% fat it is... but looking at the list of food, where do I get the fat from and how much in actual weight do I need of it?

Eating meat, skipping carbs by swapping them out with green veggies is what comes to mind for me, but I feel like I would end up eating too much protein and don't actually get the fat that I need like this.

And with the lists alone, I just can't quite grasp how much I need to eat of what to achieve this 5/35/60 ratio.

So I wanted to ask if someone could give me an example of a meal that I could theoretically eat every day that would give me all the important nutreints and keeps the ratio.
Of course I don't intent to actually only eat this one meal forever, but I think it would help me understand how to structure my meals. (As in, how many grams of meat +  gramms of veggies + gramms of whatever the fat comes from) 

I usually eat 2 meals a day (brunch and dinner)

Hello fellow reddit ketoers! Just putting my story out there more for accountability but I will take support too, lol! My goal weight is just a lower number and not what I am holding myself too. I may get there, below there, or be above. For me it is all about how I feel and look to myself, and not the scale number. I found this sub over 4 years ago when I first tried keto. I was 130lbs then, and was just trying to get rid of stubborn extra tummy flab. I got down to 122 and still had it, but that's a whole 'nother post. I did not phase carbs back in, and just started eating like I did prior to keto. Add in stress from a really shitty job, anxiety and depression and you get to me at 170lbs. Then I finally got a new non stressful job and COVID lockdowns happened. We ate out the whole time and maybe cooked 3-4 times. Once we were allowed back at work I was just ordering door dash because I am lazy and it was convenient. That's how we got to me at 198lbs. My boyfriend also gained a lot of weight too, and we both were just done. We decided we would do keto, and we have been on it for about 3 or 4 weeks. To me it is the easiest diet I've ever been on and I can do it without feeling like I am depriving myself. I love that I don't get cravings or hangry anymore and that I have to actually remind myself it's probably time to eat. My only ""complaint"" is that I miss fruit. I am a huge fruit fan. My boyfriend on the other hand is a bread/pasta/rice fanatic so he hates this. He also hates all veggies except potatoes and carrots. But he is sticking with it until he gets where he wants. To him this food is just calories to fuel the body. 

I haven't started exercising yet, but I need too. Mainly for my mental health but I remember my gym routines from 4 years ago and I was just starting to feel strong and see muscles developing, so I want to get back to that feeling. I have chondromalacia (cartilage is coming off the back of my kneecaps) in both knees and a birth defect in my back (spina bifida occulta) that prevent me from doing high impact things, like running. I LOVE running. Of course I love the thing I can't do. UGH. So I suck it up in the gym (like my boyfriend does with food) for other cardio like a bike or elliptical. Anyone else limited in working out? What kind of workouts do you do? I think we will start by just going walking everyday, and I will add things in from there. I hate ""starting over"" in regards to working out because I hate feeling crappy (I am a baby for pain) for the first few weeks. No pain no gain.  


Without exercise being involved I've lost 14lbs and I'm stoked about it. My real problem is patience!!!! i just want to be back at my smaller size and feeling super confident. A pic of me from the previous keto time came up in my timehop today and OMG please gimme dat back!!! I know I will get there, but I need to stay focused on the now.

I was actually 174 when I started, but gained weight during insanity. I was half-assing my diet, i would do great 3-4 days and then I'd cheat for the rest of the week. I decided keto was a good idea because there's really no room for ""messing up"", which would keep me on top of my diet. The thought of being kicked out of ketosis is enough healthy pressure for me to not give into cravings! I am eating steaks, salmon, chicken, broccoli, yogurt, some cheeses, protein shakes, some bacon, eggs, and that's pretty much it.

This is my first week of keto, I am on day 3. Days 1 &amp; 2 were pretty good, I tried to consume LOTS of fats (only to realize that you don't need actually need that much, it's all about cutting carbs) and I kept my carbs below 22g. I am also being conscious of not going too much on protein! I bought a scale to accurately measure my food so I KNOW what kind of calories and macros I'm getting, which has actually been nice! I was WAY off from my previous guessing.

I've made sure to keep up with my electrolytes, I started taking magnesium and potassium tablets yesterday, and I know I'm getting enough sodium. BUT this morning I felt the symptoms of a hangover. Usually when I drink alcohol, I take magnesium and potassium tablets, eat food, and drink plenty of water before I fall asleep- and usually I feel fine. BUT THIS MORNING I FELT HUNGOVER, even though I've been keeping up with water intake and electrolytes!

ALSO, I've been feeling very anxious, and my awareness has changed. I feel like my world is just off. Like something happened that made my life super different. Then I started to doubt the entire diet. I was like ""is this healthy?"" ""am I putting myself in danger?"" ""I am challenging my body too hard?"". Idk I kept thinking about this as artificial scarcity, I guess there's a lot of fear based stuff in the media about this diet that's making me doubt this whole thing. Has ANYONE gone through this?

There are so many new folks that get railed by asshats that have convinced themselves anything processed is anti keto. And I believe these folks hurt the keto community.

That nutrition was very difficult to maintain, moreover I had also few health negative consequences. After I interrupted it, I bounced back to 260lbs. Then I tried a low-cal balanced diet I had a relatively lower weight loss and It was again very difficult to follow this kind of nutrition.

My dream has been to go back under 220lbs (100kg). I was really upset that even though in the past I got the target, I‘d not been able to stay there. I was quite desperate, and I couldn’t control my weight at all, and I reached again and again 260lbs.

One year ago, while I was struggling with my last low-fat/low-cal diet with actual poor results and lot of hardship, I was told about keto and the incredible result you can achieve with it.

I started with keto, and I have to admit, initially it was very difficult. Big difficulties for me was to give up on my beloved pasta and pizza and that’s a real sacrifice considering I’m Italian.

I was almost to give up, when luckily one year ago a friend of mine introduced an Italian brand specialized in low card foods to. They offer pasta, bread, cakes all with very low carb content (around 5gr CHO/100gr). There are also preparations to make pasta, bread, pizza and cakes home. Everything tastes delicious. You wouldn’t be even able to recognize differences with high carb food.

This way I’m now able to eat all my beloved dishes keeping my carbohydrate lower than 25gr a day.

Eating in such a way eventually I hit my target few months ago and I’m going further down. My current weight is 210lbs (95Kg)

Backstory: I used to be 203lbs(5'9 male) back in August, now at 164lbs after tonights cheat meal maybe at 169lbs.  

I do back to back water fasting, and keto on eating days. I eat virtually no sugar on keto not even artificial sugar. It seems like my weight loss had stalled at 164 lbs, so I thought take a break from keto, and eat whatever I wanted to get my leptin levels up. I still ate keto, I just couldn't order anything off of uber eats for some reason. I just craved broccoli, and spinach with a hamburger patty with cheese. So I had that for lunch, and the same meal for dinner. With an organic cookie, half of a brownie, and some chocolate pretzels. 

So an hour ago, I said to myself I need more carbs, so I finally went with something on uber eats. I went with Wendy's. I got some nuggets, fries, and a burger.  BIG MISTAKE. The food tasted so badddddddddddddd, like ewwwwww. My organic burger tasted way better than the wendy's burger. After all these years, I finally know why people say to avoid processed foods.Cause I feel like shit now. I felt like the meal I had was not wholesome at all.

We like everyone else decided to try it.  The 1st week went well, I lost 7lb and my friend lost 8lb (not that we are competing or anything).  So far so good, right? Well into my 3rd week I lost 2lb and my friend gained 5lb.  In the meantime both my brother and my mom got on the kick and the same thing happened to them.  They lost a good amount of weight the 1st 2 weeks and then it slowed down drastically.  After talking with my brother, his friend (in the nutrition field) mentioned a different approach that basically outlined the do's and don't with this kind of diet and set him up with a ""eating"" plan.  Did it work? Yes. Do I have a friend that is willing to set up a personal ""eating"" plan for me? The answer is no.  Do I want to pay someone tons of money to tell me how to eat? Also no. But I did some research and there is tons of it on the internet.  I've been reading the forums, articles, posts, you name it.  Everything I came across had conflicting info.  So the same friend that got me started on this Keto life style found the Keto Resource and the 28 day Keto online.  He swears by it, and he didn't have to pay someone tons of money.  So what did I do? I paid the $37 (it was on sale) and I signed up for the ""challenge"", I figured why not.  Its cheap and if it works, even better. So far I changed my eating habits and I feel less bloated and not as hungry.  Here is the link if anyone is interested, I figured I'd share and maybe it will help some more people out.

My own experience on sustaining:

After 2 years of strict keto and reaching my goal body fat and weight, I relaxed the protocol and would treat myself to ice cream (w/real sugar) almost daily (2 scoops &lt;20 g carbs) and do not restrict carbs on the weekends (however, carbs feel so filling now that I can only eat once a day on the weekends).

Blood tests show I’m still always in ketosis. Any weight gained from a weekend of carbs disappears by mid-week and I haven’t had dreams about eating carbs for the last 2 years. In fact, carbs make me feel so full so quickly that I tend to avoid any old carbs and only eat carbs I really love like ice cream and French fries.

I had been doing OMAD keto (lazy just counting carbs) for a few months when I started to get some aching pains in my feet and knees, as well as had a couple nights where I had pretty bad leg cramps. I didn't really pay much attention and actually thought I was dehydrated so I started drinking more water on a regular basis. I think this was a mistake, because over time the pain got slightly worse, and one day I actually ended up having my vision go blurry very suddenly and I developed an absolutely horrible headache that hospitalized me (I've never had headaches like this one, could definitely be classified as a migrane as it was absolutely unbearable). Those of you with more keto experience probably already know what happened.

They ran tests and everything looked normal. I did however have potassium on the low end of normal as well as sodium and magnesium were in the lower end. I did some more research (which I should have done in the first place), and it became very clear that I was not consuming enough electrolytes.

I am starting to think supplementing electrolytes during long term keto is something that should really be pushed as a necessity for newcomers. I do wonder how many people end up writing off this diet because they had an experience like mine.

Since the event I have been supplementing 400mg of potassium and magnesium, and 1000mg of sodium per day. Since I started I gave felt all around much better both mentally and physically while in ketosis.

Drink water before and after meals to suppress hunger and make you feel fuller  

2. Stay hydrated, it's just healthy and helps any form of weight loss.  

3. Get some exercise in, nothing crazy. 30 minutes of walking is all you need, maybe 3-7 times a day. Exercising is not required for weight loss in keto diet.  

4. Try to eat as far into the day as possible so you don't end up eating too often.   

5. Limit how many meals you eat a day to avoid feeling. On a keto diet, you shouldn't feel hungry very often because your body is in ketosis, so take advantage of that to decrease caloric intake. Make sure to diversify your foods and get some veggies in to get proper nutrition.  

6. Avoid environments where non-keto foods are available. This is obvious but very important. If, for example, your family is eating cookies in the kitchen, stay in your room doing something else  

7. Keep in mind that the beginning of starting a keto diet is the hardest, then your cravings will go away and so is your appetite.   

8. You can still overeat on keto. No matter what diet or exercise plan you're on, if you're overeating, you'll see less results. Make sure that you're eating slowly and not having big proportions.  

9. Best to limit yourself up to 20 carbs. It's a limit, not a goal, you don't have to try to hit 20 carbs. Realize that this is the recommended maximum to guarantee ketosis. 

10. If you mess up, it's okay. I didn't stick to the keto diet on my first try. You have so many more times to try again.

So in March after losing out on GME (And a lot of research into carbs and sugar documentary and more etc but that's less dramatic) I decided to completely change my lifestyle and started a 1 week fast and then slowly moved to a 22 hours Intermittent fasting, slowly adding healthy foods.

Then after a bit, I started swapping stuff around then adding exercise, I decided to add a salad to the diet and experimented with eating times, now eating 2:10 pm Salad wise and 6:30-7 pm during the main meal (I eat the walnuts and dark chocolate right after dinner, so I count it as a main meal) time which I assume would count as a 6-hour eating window even though I only eat twice.

Though I can feel the difference from extremely unhealthy junk food and Irn Bru (fizzy drinks) every day to this diet, I lost about 15-18kg from the fast alone, though I plateaued a bit from then as I stayed at 120kg for 2 weeks, this could be from countless of things and I also started to do 1 hour walks every day in the morning and pushed my waking up time to 6:15 AM, so hopefully that speeds up the system health and metabolic wise",True,False,False,keto,t5_2rske,2358490,public,self,Made new lifestyle changes and wondering if what I eat would be considered Keto?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/mmv8vu/made_new_lifestyle_changes_and_wondering_if_what/,all_ads,6,,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'Uc6tCuqaoZnhDL8nQ5PjC8xXLmfjKdpn1skfimlcVZ8', 'resolutions': [{'height': 145, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/eKgsPiWkr_a1HJXygmRCqxniFcSHTTnKp8koUKP9IXE.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b6d124b30a26452b2b8cd0eeb70f07783a68512', 'width': 108}, {'height': 290, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/eKgsPiWkr_a1HJXygmRCqxniFcSHTTnKp8koUKP9IXE.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2cb7fda22ac661fc0ebff753c2ebcd62dd48dd6', 'width': 216}, {'height': 430, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/eKgsPiWkr_a1HJXygmRCqxniFcSHTTnKp8koUKP9IXE.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9799fe059da35de786ef3057dc1ecca053acb0fa', 'width': 320}, {'height': 860, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/eKgsPiWkr_a1HJXygmRCqxniFcSHTTnKp8koUKP9IXE.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24b584eb168803ec4a2c7a63d6d2da74a42a2206', 'width': 640}], 'source': {'height': 1047, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/eKgsPiWkr_a1HJXygmRCqxniFcSHTTnKp8koUKP9IXE.png?auto=webp&amp;s=689d6104270974913711be131aba08aea0cc480a', 'width': 779}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,

I’ve been doing IF and some 36hr fasts for the past 1,5 months with absolutely no issues, and coffee on an empty stomach has been just fine. Absolutely no discomfort or anything.

I love the IF lifestyle, and don’t want to give up on the ketones just yet. I at least want to try a longer fast first.

*“I’m closer than ever to my goal weight! I have energy to do things with my children,”* Kendra says.

Here’s Kendra’s inspiring story, which has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

## Kendra’s keto journey

My name is Kendra, I’m 32 years old, and I live in the US Midwest.

﻿I started following the keto diet in April 2018. Since then, I’ve lost over 100 pounds (45 kilos)!

Initially, it wasn’t easy. I used to overdo it on snacks, sweets, and fast food. My portion sizes were out of control.

I realized that not only was I setting *myself* up for health issues, like diabetes, congestive heart failure, and high blood pressure that run in my family, but I was setting *my children* up for the same.

I decided enough was enough. A friend told me about the keto diet and the success she was having, and I started the next day.

These days, I cook at home and we rarely eat out. I’ve learned how to cook a variety of healthy and delicious meals. I can make just about any dish keto-friendly. I’ve also incorporated intermittent fasting. On most days, my eating window is 12 pm to 8 pm, and at least one day a week I do ‘one meal a day’ .

Of course, there have been times when I’ve eaten high-carb foods, but eating these foods only made me realize that my body just doesn’t agree with them. Low carb is what works best for me.

Several months ago, I also decided to quit a detrimental sugar addiction that developed after I quit alcohol. This is when I decided to make the change to the ketogenic WOE. (I did keto 3 years ago and really enjoyed how full of life it made me, so I wanted to return to it.)

Preliminary thanks for your help.

I started keto last Monday, sub 20g carbs and meticulously tracking my electrolytes per the FAQ, and I just have a couple questions.

So the first 5 or so days I actually felt great, increased energy and clearer cognition, which is what I’m hoping keto can help me with, but after that I’ve begun to feel sluggish and just a little ... off. I don’t feel awful, it isn’t keto flu, I just feel a little lesser than. I searched around and found that almost every question like this ends up being answered by the deafening roar of everyone saying: ELECTROLYTES. 

So, to head that off, I promise you, I’ve been supplementing and tracking my electrolytes.

So my question is: At what point should I begin to consistently feel the benefits from keto (energy, cognition, etc.)? I’m on day 9 and feeling generally meh, but I’m willing to wait it out if that’s necessary. But I do wonder about the timeline, and possibly some tips on how to optimize my diet for therapeutic benefits.

Hello! 

I am new to keto &amp; reddit. I started keto about a week ago. I believe that I am in ketosis (went through a period of exhaustion, peeing a lot, weird taste in mouth, etc.). A lot of the negative symptoms are now gone. I feel way less bloated now which is great.

My question for now is will things like Rebel ice cream &amp; diet soda slow down my progress ? I attempted Keto in the past and lost 13 pounds in one week. However, I was pretty strict then. I gave in on day 8.

Fast forward 6 months later and I weigh 30 pounds more. I want a diet that is sustainable. However, I don’t want diet soda or rebel to slow down my progress. I am not proud of it but I have probably ate 4 pints in my first week. Additionally, I have been having between 2-5 diet sodas a day. I know I should cut back. My cravings do not feel as strong now so hopefully I can.

Does anyone have any input, advice, thoughts, or information they can share with me to help? 

I would like to lose 80 pounds by December. I’m sincerely willing to do what it takes - open to learning!

I used to do 23-1 IF and keto and had great results while working a labour intensive job. This was a couple years ago by now and I'm considering getting back into keto again (just started IF again)    

I was looking for meal suggestions though because I really like to keep things simple.   

When I was doing 23-1, I was eating 1 omelette a day and that was my meal. It was 3-4 eggs, 0.5-1lb of lean ground beef with some vegetables and hotsauce and that was basically it. Though I'm less active now (not doing 40 hours of labor a week) so I'm not sure if 3\~ eggs a day is the greatest idea with all the saturated fat but maybe it's not an issue at all.     

I never felt weak on that diet. There were days at work where I was hungry by lunch which kinda sucked but I never felt exhausted, lightheaded or anything like that and did this diet for months.  

So what are your favourite meals? Do you take vitamin/electrolyte supplements? By chance do you know if my omelette strategy meets all/most of the recommended intakes?   

I'm considering keto again mostly because even veggie-packed dishes that are supposed to keep me full just don't. Example: I literally just finished a 36 hour fast like 3 hours ago. I broke it by eating half a pineapple and then half an hour later had a banana and some oatmeal. That is already 500 calories and a decent amount of food but an hour later I was still hungry. I decided I'd make a stirfry. I used like 1/4 grated cauliflower instead of rice, a piece of haddock, cucumber, carrots, broccoli and black beans. Ate a full, average size bowl of that and an hour later I could go eat the rest.

Sound like a plan? 

Postnote: Enjoyed the pasta and goodies but had a decent amount of unexpected guilt surrounding this. I mention because I think many would agree - in the course of a year - there will be times where its just very practical to suspend the strictness. I know I want to continue with the macros etc. for a few reasons (I feel better for one!), but learning how to navigate these schedules is a good skill. That month of being strict got easier and easier, then now, restarting, is second-nature almost. I think that will become the norm for me.

..

I am a food scientist, working in one of the largest food ingredients company in the world. Most of the time, I worked with major (and minor) food manufacturers for colas and beverages, crackers and cookies, snacks, sauces, instant meals, breads, sausages… you named it. 

How to I make them delicious? Through scientific manipulation of flavours and textures.

How to I make them cost as cheap as possible for profits? Using the cheapest fillers (think gums,  starch/modified starch, air, water, palm oil, sugar, syrups), combination of above while maintaining the longest possible shelf life.

My job is to create the most delicious, addictive and profitable wonders.

Now, why the confession? Because, personally I avoid these like plagues… I do not consume what I create. The only exception where I ‘eat’ my creations were duration product presentation and tasting sessions with my customers (I.e. food manufacturers), and secretly spit out on a tissue, unseen. 

..

I came from Singapore, where we pride ourselves as food paradise. And as with most Asian families, my ‘old’ home diet were largely filled with carbohydrates – rice, noodles, and mixing in the modern fast foods and snacks. We were fat, very fat. I WERE fat. We embraced low fat diet think that would save us. Thanks America,  your SAD and my government.

Likewise, when I was in University (late 2000s), low fat is (and still) encouraged in our product development and nutrition modules. Incidentally, I took biochemistry as well, and was some credits away to be a dietitian, if I want to.

At that time, the fat me was looking ways to slim down – which I manage to via CICO, but became skinny fat and bouncing back to fat. In combination of curiosity, frustration and google – I found The Warrior’s Diet by Ori Hofmekler, which then I fell into the rabbits’ hole of paleo, low-carb, keto, The Bitter Truth of Sugar (great video), Ancel Keys (fuck you), and Pure, White and Deadly (great book), along with countless literatures that are eyeopeners and equally suspicious. 

I. was. Mindblown.

Things I learn in school about nutrition were wrong.

I still remember the yelling from my mum and the ‘WTF’ look of acquaintances when I started the journey of keto.

10 years later, I am in and maintaining my greatest shape of my life – visible abs, strong and energetic, I looked good, in fact easily passed 5-8 years younger of my current age. My (2 years ago) last blood test has 265 mg/dL total cholesterol, HDL of 66 mg/dL, LDL of 145 mg/dL, Triglycerides of 31 mg/dL. No V-LDL readings available but I am extremely happy with my triglycerides. My testosterone level shot up too. Doc told me to take statin lol.

My mum? She lost 30kg, very happy and look much younger than her peers too. I am happy that she listened to me.

However, after all these, I still unable to convinced my dad and close friends. So I just keeping to myself now, to reddit, and to friends that need help and listens.

I am glad to take this journey, and will continue doing so.

I have posted a picture of me at my Daughter's birthday party in October of last year and a picture of me present day. I have tried multiple different diets, pills, drinks, bars, and just about everything else you could think of. One of my closest friends was nearly 400lbs when his Dr. told him that his life was in danger and he needed to make a change. He researched the Keto diet and started it. I was amazed at his results. After seeing myself in those pictures at my Daughters bday, I decided to give it a try. At first I felt stupid for trying another diet that would most assuredly fail. I felt like an idiot eating my hotdogs and burgers without buns, I felt like a girly man switching from IPA beer, to no carb seltzers. I missed gorging myself in pastas and bread, and doughnuts (oh my god..the doughnuts!), but I told myself I would give it an honest try for a week and see what happens. I weighed in at the end of that week and had lost 4lbs, it was full speed ahead from there. The real reason I wanted to make this post is because there were multiple times in the last 7 months that I was stuck at one weight range and thought I would never lose anymore, it frustrated the HELL out of me, but I stuck to it, you have to stick to it! At one point it took me an entire month to get from 247 to 245. I started a 20 minute HIT workout on my rowing machine, 3 times a week and went fully religious on the Keto diet. I gave myself a goal to get to 230lbs (because that is the weight that google told me I would no longer be obese at my height lol). In the picture at my daughter's party I was 283lbs, today I weighed in at 231. If you are stuck and you are frustrated, I came here today to say...DON'T STOP! Get more physical, drink more water. YOU CAN DO THIS!

I'm not drawn to this so much for weight loss, my weight is more or less stable. What really brought me to keto was going on whole 30 with my fianceé last year and then connecting some dots.

So, I'm diagnosed with Graves' Disease (AI thyroid disorder) and pretty much had it for as long as I can remember. I didn't get diagnosed til I was in my early twenties. A little under a decade later, and at the time of undergoing whole 30, I went to get some lab work done. My Endo tells me that my Graves' was entirely gone. WHAT?! I couldn't put a finger as to what happened due to other stressors going on at the time. Fast forward to about a month ago and I've gone down the rabbit hole of ketogenesis. All of the benefits from weight loss, boosts of energy, to possible reversal of some horrible illnesses. A light bulb had finally turned on and I gathered that my illness went into remission because I cut all the grains and sugar (although I still ate potatoes that I'd cook). This was such a wild occurrence, I couldn't stop thinking about finally making the jump myself.

I know I'm going to be starting with simple dishes. Eggs/bacon, salads with oil dressings, burger bowls, bone broth. I'm trying to figure out how to fit Japanese cuisines into this as well, it is my homeland, after all. One question I've had is what to do for the tare (broth seasoning). Idk if I can get past the shirataki noodles, so I may opt out of noodle options entirely. Eggs/veggies/meats will be easy enough, but the seasoning is difficult to put a finger to.

Does everyone in here regularly go to farmer's markets and butchers? I don't want to break the bank too much but I know I want as much lasting impact as possible. I've also thought ahead to get lite salt and mio flavoring for ""ketoade"" to fight the keto flu. I'm definitely starting with 1/8 teaspoon of salt to make sure I'm not overdoing anything. I'm really excited to see where this takes me - if I could rid my anxiety, hand tremors, fast heart rate, or to just generally feel really good.

After wrestling with alcoholism for over a decade and a half, I decided it was time to stop the cycle before I turned 30. In that time I had an incredibly complex and unhealthy relationship with food. I was always overweight, but was able to maintain a active lifestyle participating in sports year-round. After moving to the big city for work when I was 26, I began a sedentary lifestyle and drank over a 5th of alcohol 4-7 days a week for 4 years, and gained 100lbs in the process.

This isn’t a sobriety sub so I’ll skip to Keto. 6 months into sobriety, I began strictly monitoring my nutrition using Carb Manager and a food-scale. After 2 weeks of tweaking my diet, I finally started seeing the pounds melt off. I’m under 400lbs for the first time in 3 years, with a goal weight of 260. I am 6’3’’, and haven’t been under 300lbs since I was 5 inches shorter and 15 years younger. Realizing nutrition was a part of life and not just a short term diet made the whole process much easier and less daunting. 

Wish me luck!

This time i went from 209 to 197 in 9 days (started incorporated light cardio at the end of my lifts as well). I felt exactly how i expected to feel, foggy etc. but after about 16 days of it i never got out of the carb crash and mental fogginess. Simple mental math became almost impossible. In the gym i felt great energy wise but i lost about 10-12% of strength on all of my one rep Max’s in the bench, squat and deadlift which didn’t happen the last time i did no carb keto, in fact last time i did keto i was making new person records in the gym. My bench went from 300 to 270 for example. 

I started eating carbs again with each meal but a much reduced amount than i used to. For example half a bagel with my breakfast instead of 2 whole bagels with my chicken, Turkey bacon and veggie breakfast. 

I had to start eating carbs again to get my mental performance back, my ability to do mental math at work and safely operate my car are much more important than getting a little extra shredded quicker.

HOWEVER after indulging in a fathead pizza tonight I realised while logging my meals for the day that the pre grated stuff contains a lot more carbs (3.9g in my dinner!) I assume because of flour used to dry it out.

Thankfully after logging my day I came in at 18g so still keto, but it was close and I was trying hard to follow keto recipes, had a light snack for lunch because I knew I was having the pizza for dinner and haven't eaten between meals today. I was shocked at how easily I had come so close to being out of keto (and wonder how often this happens or if indeed I am even in ketosis because maybe I havent been looking closely enough!)

So how do you guys tackle mozzarella? Do you have a method for drying fresh stuff out? Do you just use the pre grated and factor it in to your macros for the day?

I either get the King Oscar sardines or mackerel in olive oil. I keep the olive oil in there, as it's fat and I hate to waste good nutritional food. And I want to vary the fats I'm eating.  


The problem is that when I do my macros on cronometer, or search the internet, the only nutritional values are for a *drained can*.   
*80g can drained - 240 calories*  
The net weight of the can (with oil) is 115g, so another   
*35g of olive oil - 310 calories*  
This is putting me at *550 calories for a can*\- which is what it is I suppose.  
But is this how y'all are figuring it? Or do most people drain the oil?  


I have been cheating and entering the gram value for the can at 115, which outputs at only 345 calories. But who am I kidding really?

I’m 2 months in and 29 lbs down. My confidence has increased dramatically and I was surprised out how stable my moods been. No more mood swings or days where I’ve felt unhappy for no reason whatsoever. 
At first I found it hard due to me being a big snacker and worst of all snacking on carb heavy foods like sandwiches. Anything that’s easy to grab basically. But once you figure out what foods you can have and what foods to avoid it’s actually very easy to adjust your lifestyle to implement keto.

My advice to anyone new is to do your research. The FAQ has a lot of great info on keto and it’s laid out in a way that’s easy for beginners to understand. Another page I found https://sites.google.com/view/ketodietfactsonline/home is very good aswell. Quick and to the point which is how I like to live my life! No big long article to read just info summarised to help you. I also signed up for the keto meal plan they have on the website but it definitely isn’t necessary. It just helped me because I’m very busy and work 55 hours a week so it saved me time in trying to think of recipes to make and all that jazz. It definitely worked anyway so if anyone’s busy it’s a very good plan to follow

The main thing to remember is keto works! Summers just around the corner but with keto you can have the body of your dreams by then! It can be tough but just think of the results!

Every now and then, I'll get a postprandial BG reading that's between 15 to 20 mg/dL higher than usual. It's not necessarily because of what I've eaten. As I said, I've been eating pretty consistently--I'll just rotate through some group of foods over and over.

When this happens, almost without fail, my weight the following morning will be between 0.6 and a full pound lower than the previous morning. 

I'm not sure if the higher BG is causing me to piss more or something, but there seems to be a correlation.

So I’ve done my research and been on keto for about 2 weeks now, and I get the gist of it. Pretty straightforward High Fat, Moderate protein, and low carbs. But I’m new to actually caring about my diet and I’ve noticed a lot with reading other peoples stories and watching videos online that some food combinations works better for some and not other people and a lot of times people have to tweak their diet to their body type, exercise level, and the specific affects it has specifically on their body and it helps them tremendously. I’m confused on what to look for specifically in my body to see which foods have the most favorable effect for me. I noticed that a glycemic response varies from person to person and that’s super important, are there any other tiny details that lead up to my overall outcome that I can note down and do experiments with to craft the perfect combinations of food for myself? I know it’s better to sometimes keep it simple but honestly getting into the scientific tiny details is actually what I love about doing this diet, it helps me understand my body more and what i put into it so go as deep as you can. I hope my question was clear enough for you all, have a good day 😃  Also it might help to note, I’m a 25 year old female, around 190 pounds, more of an athletic build, a lot of weight around the tummy and thighs, I’m fairly active because even though I have desk job I average 11,000 steps per weekday and then I work out on weekends.",True,False,False,keto,t5_2rske,2356433,public,self,Personalizing your keto experience,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/mlb35k/personalizing_your_keto_experience/,all_ads,6,SOS,715fe9ae-abe7-11e8-8938-0ef2dfd48a7e,Help,,,,,,,,,,,

I had previously had success with keto a year or so ago. I decided to come off it as I was working out so hard and plateaued. I lost roughly 70 lbs. 

Skip ahead, and I ended up extremely sick last summer and was diagnosed with Lyme disease. I could no longer exercise like before and depression hit so hard! The only way I know to cope is eating, which caused me to gain back 20-25 lbs. 

My doc states keto should be my diet of choice in regards to the Lyme disease for as long as I have symptoms (possibly forever). I find myself dreading the idea and also not trusting myself to follow through without using food (especially carbs!) as my drug of choice. I am also struggling to find low intensity workouts due to knee and joint pain.

I'm well aware a good fraction of that will be from the magical water weight/carb weight that comes from starting a diet, but still it is the largest amount of weight I've ever lost in a week. My old record was 4. 

I have read a fair few posts and articles about keto and I'm pretty sure I understand the process, though I am skipping a few steps. 

I do not know my macros, I do not weigh my food in-depth, I am very loosely counting calories and the only real number I'm tracking is carbs. 

My typical intake is between 15-30 carbs, it varies based on what meals I have. 

Are there any serious issues with not collecting statistics on my food?

I am taking a multivitamin and omega3 oil since I am not a seafood fan. 

I'm not eating like a sparrow either, my portions are large and I do not go hungry. 

I eat 2 meals a day with no snacks, an average day consists of an omlette (3 eggs, salami, cheese, salt, pepper, chives) as my first meal and a large portion of meat and brocolli for my second. Sometimes I switch the 2nd meal out for sausages and fried eggs. 

Driving water, black coffee and black tea. 

Overall, I feel great. My appetite seems to be getting worse every single day but my energy level is so high. My breath smells like fermented fruit and I am expelling so much waste. 

As far as I can see, I am achieving ketosis, I just hope I'm not dooming myself by not doing the maths. 

I know I'll give up if I need to carry the 7 and divide by 2 slices of bacon just to eat.

I was wondering if any of you have experience with high triglycerides while doing keto?

In the past, while doing keto I would bounce around from 150 to my lowest of about 37. 

Over the past year and a half I’ve significantly gained weight eating junk and not being able to workout, but recently have been trying to get back to keto and working out. 

The nurse called me back and said my triglycerides were extremely high (1081), but I immediately told her I wasn’t fasted, to which she then replied “regardless it shouldn’t be near that amount”.

That morning I had sandwich meat, 6 ounces of ground beef, a slice of cheese, a carb balance tortilla, and a probably a decent amount of Mayo on the side to dip in. About 5 hours later I went to get labs done but specifically told them I wasn’t fasted and that I’d have to wait for the lipid panel(which I guess they tested).

I’d feel more at ease knowing my triglycerides are high if they were somewhere around 300-400, but I’m wondering if me eating a high fat meal hours before can influence them that much?

I thought a keto diet might end my carb cravings and bring me a peace of mind, but I tried it three times already and it never worked.

It´s the exact same thing every single time: The first two days I feel fine, but then on the third day I wake up with a racing heart beat, feeling like I have the worst panic attack of my life, or a heart attack or something. I also get violently sick and the throwing-up only stops after several hours and only after eating something like a piece of toast, because simply the thought of eating more fat makes me sick again.

I thought it was an extreme kind of keto flue, but then I´ve read that it could be a severe reaction to histamine. I think it´s called histamine dumping? 

Now I don´t really understand why that happened, I basically ate the same, fresh foods as usual, I drank a lot of water, I basically just cut out the bread and the oats from my diet until I hit the requiered macros and thats it.

I really enjoy it, its actually been pretty easy to adjust and I have almost no cravings. I take birth control so I was expecting to have no issues hormonally, as I’ve had no issues for the past year and a half in terms of regularity. Immediately after switching to keto my cycle is very off and even a few months in has yet to adjust. It hasn’t stopped, it’s just irregular. Should I up my carb intake? I try to stay under 15g of (net) carbs per day so maybe I’m being too restrictive. I’m also only eating around 900-1100 calories because I’m usually not hungry enough for more and I can’t exercise due to a recent surgery. I was usually eating around 1100-1200 calories daily and weight lifting 5x per week. I’ve been worried about my hormones since my cycle has been off and I’ve heard keto can be a part of that. I’m also worried about not eating enough, even though I know 900 calories isn’t enough I’m just not that hungry on keto. Are there any adjustments I could make to maybe help keto work for me, or should I switch to something like a plain calorie defecit and focus on getting my calorie intake correct? If it means anything I calculated my BMR and its around 1360 calories, but it also said something about my intake for sedentary activity level (right now) should be around 1595. Im not sure if thats useful in helping me decide what I should do. I just know it’s probably not good for my body to be 400-600 calories short of my BMR. I dont know how accurate that is to be fair, I also understand that eating less than 1200 calories per day is unhealthy. Should I prioritize calorie intake or following keto?

I started my keto journey for the 3rd or 4th time on December 15th, so I'm coming up on 4 months of keto.  While in the past I've succumbed to cheat days that just never ended or went on vacations where it was very difficult to find food that was keto-friendly, this pandemic has actually helped me!  I haven't had a single cheat day that I would consider a cheat day.  I've generally kept to less than 20g carbs per day, only once or twice going up to 35-40.  I'm mostly OMAD but sometimes TMAD on weekends.   I don't really snack throughout the day, and whenever I feel those hunger pangs, I just drink water until I'm full and that satiates me for a while.

I started at around 325 - that's my best guess.  I don't know exactly because A) I was afraid to step on the scale, and B) my scale doesn't go above 300.  I'm currently at about 275, so around 50 pounds lost in 4 months.

While I have seemed to plateau a little bit scale-weight wise recently (seemed to be stuck around 280 for a couple weeks), that has begun dropping again.

I've found that when washing my hands, my wedding rings falls off if I'm not careful, and it's super loose regularly.  I usually take it off when cooking dinner as I wash my hands frequently and sometimes forget to put it back on.  My husband has even brought it to me asking if I was planning on leaving him since I keep leaving it places lol.  Unfortunately it's made of titanium so it can't be resized, but we only bought cheap rings at the start of our marriage with the intention of getting nicer ones in the future.  Maybe this is the impetus for that!

I recently found a fitbit and decided to charge it and wear it some more - I haven't worn it in probably 6 months, and now, it's so loose that I need to take another link out of the strap!

Most noticeable to me, was that I can actually SEE my Adam's Apple now!  I went so long not even realizing I couldn't see it, but my neck was so fat that it was hidden.

I started keto three weeks ago, after not being able to lose any weight with weeks of 16:8 intermittent fasting. I'm not someone who has ever been able to count calories or limit portions, so it seemed like keto was the diet for me. I read about which foods to avoid and which were allowed, and made it my goal to consumer no more than 20g of carbs per day (not net carbs, but total carbs). Because I didn't weigh portions or count calories, I can't be sure I always made the target, but here is what I did:

* Check the labels on everything that has a label, to make sure not to accidentally consume too many carbs
* Cut out sugar and anything with added sugar (occasionally using a pinch of monkfruit to sweeten my coffee or whipped cream)
* absolutely nothing carb-heavy such as bread, rice, or pasta. No legumes.
* Ate fish, seafood, and meats including beef, chicken, pork, and sausages, either sauteed or grilled and without breading
* Plenty of eggs
* Vegetables including snap peas, fennel, greens, avocado, radish, cabbage, broccoli, and asparagus. Carrots and cherry tomatoes in small amounts
* Fruits: raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries, about 1/2 to 1 cup a day
* heavy cream in my coffee and whipped on my berries
* Spirits such as gin and vodka, as well as hard seltzers (2g of carbs each)

This was a huge change to my diet. It was difficult and I was sometimes miserable. The first week I felt physically ill and didn't have a lot of appetite. The next 2 weeks I felt normal. 

No change to the amount of exercise I get, which is not a lot. Mostly walking.

For the first 2 weeks my weight didn't change. At the end of the third week I had gained 3 pounds.

I've read on here about people counting calories, fasting with keto, doing ""macros"" (don't understand that), etc. I just don't think I could stick with a diet that required too much calculating.

It's true. Just like alcohol, opioids, or any addictive substance, carbs and sugar can be a cunning enemy. I've been on a low-carb/now super-low-carb way of eating since Feb., and I've lost approximately 20- something lbs. But I still have a sweet tooth; always have had. At first, overcoming the desire for a sweet taste didn't seem so hard. But now, I find it harder, since everything I eat is salty/savoury. I'll chew sugar-free gum, but that doesn't always do it. 

Last night, I succumbed to the temptation and had the first carby/processed/garbage thing in two months (a bowl of rice Chex). Now I'm afraid that since I've ""fallen off the wagon"" once, I'll be able to justify/rationalise it easier next time.

I was in my friend's backyard, and he was telling me how there is hops growing on the fence line.   
We were checking it out, because plants are neat.   
He told me that if you chew on it, (not eat) it tastes like a hoppy beer.   
I did. He was right.   


He let me pick some. I took it home, chopped it up, and mixed it into a can of low carb beer.   
I did not drink it right then and there,  but rather I put it in the fridge in a sealed container.   


I waited about 3 days.   
Then I strained some out and used it as more of a flavour shot in a new can of beer, and BAM! Less boring, low carb beer.

First I want to say that this transformation is nothing compared to what I’ve seen in this sub weight wise, you guys are amazing, but we all have our struggles regardless of the weight of the scale and this shit is about taking RESPONSIBILITY for yourself and your values. 

Your self esteem is the reputation that you have with yourself and it’s always watching you to see if you’re living through your values.

———

So a year ago little before my birthday I felt horrible, I worked 72h/w in a sales job. I was doing great sales wise with all time high records here and there but that shit doesn’t matter. I still destroyed my body and mind. You know just to be able to sustain the long and intensive days I had to constantly eat. I ate 6 tasty cheese every fricking day + breakfast and dinner, that’s just absurd. 

But of course... understandable considering the HUGE amount of stress the job gave me in combination with not living truthfully with myself.

———

After reflecting deeply on my values I decided to:

Quit my job and pursue what I wanted which was running why own company and getting my grades up. So I did just that. 

I decided that I wanted to have a body fat of 15% and hit 120kg bench press (which I thought was impossible at first). So I did just that.


This is actually about deciding who you want to be and sustain meaningful effort &amp; suffering. Because suffering is not bad, it’s quite good, well it’s actually a gift to be able to suffer for something meaningful and is the fundamental thing for most successes.

But if you have no direction and no meaning behind the suffering it’s a recipe for all kinds of mental disorders which will lead to other negative consequences.

Ben pakulski is someone who I've actively followed for a long time and who's muscle building programs have given me great success. He isn't someone who actively promotes a ketogenic diet but does follow the principles of it. Even before I had ever heard of the word keto, in his programs he always promoted a protein and high fat breakfast. He's never sought to be in an active state of ketosis but does promote a carb free approach to starting the day and pre training nutrition for the clarity and mental focus it provides over carb loaded meals.

Anyway, this episode is him with someone talking about following a keto diet and training for muscle building. It was good for me as a newbie to get an understanding into what actually happens on a keto diet and how you can utilise its benefits. It might not be for the seasoned ketoers because you might already have a lot of this knowledge, but for people starting out or those who just want more knowledge it's a good listen imo.

So my brother tried keto with me and my mom in January and of course he quit it even before keto flu hit him, said it was too restrictive for him.

Now, some company came up with yet another wonder drug, they even call it 'keto' and claimed that one teaspoon in the evening would get you right on the full keto train and you lose 50lbs in two weeks. No exercise, no eating restraint.

The stuff is made of a mixture of hemp oil, olive oil and some amino acid. Nothing else. 
I know this must be fraud, you just don't go keto over night by swallowing oils, especially not when keeping carbs in your diet.

The crucial thing is, he wants to buy this ridiculously expensive stuff and actually thinks it will help him without cutting out coke, fast food and all the other unhealthy stuff he puts in his mouth every day.

How can I make him see that this is just the same make-believe as any other wonder drug? Has anyone heard of this and maybe have reliable sources?

Almost done with week #3 of my first keto diet and IF. I'm working with a trainer and he's got me on strict daily macros: 31 carbs or less, 114 fat, 170 protein, about 1830 calories. While I've adopted to some aspects of the diet pretty well (I love a big lunch with meat, cheese and avocado and the return of red meat to my diet) but I have YET to fully hit my macros. I've come close; like today I'm closing in on 240 calories to go with 72P, 7F, 5C remaining. But that's rare, and what I've noticed is that I get in trouble towards the end of the day when I still have 400-500 calories left with a decent amount of P and F too yet no Carbs left to spend. I find myself PANICKING and trying to find something fatty to ingest right before my fasting cutoff; I've done everything from melting down coconut oil with peanut butter to making an after-dinner smoothie of protein powder and MCT oil. And don't think I haven't contemplated eating half a stick of butter out of desperation.

I know some of this is my old mindset – too few calories during ""sensible"" meals while supplementing with carb-heavy snacks – and trying to retrain myself to eat heavier meals. I also realize that I could be meal-prepping more so that I have good stuff on hand to snack on, whether it be hard-boiled eggs or homemade fat bombs. But I'm curious to know what y'all do to make sure you hit your daily goals and how you fill yourselves up at the end of the day if you're too far under.

I've tried Keto several times before over they years and lost 10 ish pound before falling off the wagon each time.  
I started reading this sub in late 2020 for inspiration and to learn.  2020 was hard for me like everyone, which caused some stress baking and the correlating stress eating.  In addition I had a severe 2nd degree ankle sprain in January 2020, followed by a horrible bout of sciatica in October 2020 that plagued me into the new year.  I was sick and tired of feeling sick, and tired and painful, and I knew my weight of 205 lbs at 5'5"" and age 40 wasn't helping things at all.  I knew I needed to shed some pounds to be able to get active without pain.  
I made the lifestyle change one random day in mid January 2021 (I don't remember exactly which day, I just remember which week).  I stayed on top of my electrolytes and macros with CarbManager and while the first week was hard, after that I was feeling pretty good.  Minimal keto flu.  Then, the positive changes started.
I previously suffered a form of insomnia (couldn't STAY asleep through the night), which disappeared pretty quickly.  I live with ADHD which I've never needed to medicate to function, but HOLY MOLY, I have a mental clarity that I have never known before.  My back pain and ankle pain have basically disappeared.  Whether it's directly due to weight loss, or reduction in inflammation, I don't know, and I don't care either.  No matter how you slice it, this lifestyle is doing amazing things for me.
So, this gal sat at 205lbs somewhere in mid January.  Yesterday, I broke through 180 to land at 178.6.  I credit reading the great advice and motivational stories on this sub with my success. I was stuck around 184 for a couple of weeks until I read here that I should recalculate my macros every 10lbs down, and that really the only macro I needed to hit or exceed was protein and to eat fat to satiety rather than trying to hit the macro.  These 2 things together made the scale move down again.  I started obese, and as of yesterday I'm down to the overweight category (though, I believe BMI is mostly bullshit, but I don't have body fat calipers or anything else to help me calculate where I'm at health wise) and have reduced some health risk factors!  
My first goal is to get to 170lbs: still overweight, but I feel it's a midway marker for me.  My ultimate goal is to get to about 140 lbs and feeling STRONG. I may go to maintenance sooner if I feel ""I've made it"", because I don't want to be skinny; I want to be strong, healthy and confident.

3)  Able to prescribe specific medical **tests**,  
Ex: resting metabolic rate,  continuous glucose monitoring to see what I respond to the most, that food inflammation marker test, etc

I'm meeting with a dietician but she can't prescribe anything, even just for FSA reimbursement.

I tried it a few years ago with little success after not doing much research and not being as strict. That lasted a month or so with little results. Went back to normal eating habits.

Cut to a month before the pandemic got serious. I started up keto with my gf at the time. Really serious with it, counting calories and meal prepping. Who would of thought it could be successful if you dedicate to it. A few months into the pandemic with Lockdown in full force. I'm down probably 40 or so lbs. Relationship ended and she moved out but that motivated me for some reason and about September or so I was at a huge milestone of almost being under 200lbs! I started at nearly 280.

I costed for another could months and got really close to getting into the 100s! I'm pretty sure there was a month where I was depressed and lost motivation so I got off of keto thinking I could control my calorie intake and start working out. This didn't work out, my urge to overeat came back and I fully fell off the wagon. So that was 4 or so months back. I'm back up to around 260. I'm living in a new apartment, got my first vaccine coming up finally. Things may go back to normal. I'm currently on a business trip which requires me to live from a hotel for a couple weeks at a time. I'm ready to go back to keto and finally get under 200. I know it's possible! I think I may just have to stay on keto forever otherwise I just eat eat eat. Keto kept my hunger in check. I was hoping that this summer I would be beach ready but I got knocked on my ass.

My father died at 57 from a heart attack, I have heart disease in my family. I need to become healthier otherwise I won't last longer.

As an aside though, I'm pretty okay with keto for the most part. I've had some sleeping problems ( **sparatic** napping during the day yesterday, couldn't sleep until 2 in the night.) but I've also read that reintroducing carbs too fast is bad and that it should be done over two weeks. There's a video game I'm looking forward to in early May, and while losing weight you sort of need to pick your battles, that release weekend I'm going to enjoy myself within reason. So I'm thinking of keeping my IF as is, and keeping calories under 2000 ibs throughout April, enjoy myself when my game is released, then try to reintroduce keto throughout May.

I won't be doing dirty keto when I return though. I don't have access to a kitchen with my current living situation, but I think I can make a lot of meals work by just buying some pre-cooked hardboiled eggs and pre-cooked bacon, getting a rotisserie chicken, some canned tuna, and some things like avocado and mayo on hand.

(FEEL FREE TO SKIP THIS PARAGRAPH AS IT IS BACKSTORY BUT IS NOT NEEDED):&gt;! I have always been thin. In fact, I often got complaints from family that I was TOO thin. That all changed when I moved to Japan for studies (and I'm still studying. Starting uni next week). I was staying at a homestay and they would cook for me every day. The meals were so big, I managed to gain a few kilos. Now, I went all my teens without knowing (or caring) about my weight, so I have no point of reference other than my pants started to break often. After that I started living alone and got thin again. Then the big scary hit us all and I started cooking more. I took a look in the mirror and noticed that I no longer had that V thing around the lower ab area so I decided to check my weight. It was around 92.3kg / 203.4lb. I didn't think much of it until one day I weighed myself for the hell of it and it legitimately said 99.9kg / 220lb. The idea of ever reaching 100kg just never crossed my mind and I needed to get rid of the weight QUICK. So I tried keto and effectively I lost 15kg / 33lb in a few months. Then I stopped for a few months and went up to 86kg / 190lb, so I decided to do keto again.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

In the past two months of restarting the diet:

I lost 5kg down to about 81kg / 178lb the first month. According to a fitness geek friend of mine, my IDEAL final weight would be around 77kg / 170lb so I made that my final goal. Here is where I need your help. I have been stuck going back and forth between 80kg and 81kg for a month now and it doesn't go lower than 80.6kg or higher than 81.2kg. I make sure to always wear similar clothes, and to always weigh myself in the morning right after waking up, after using the bathroom if I need to. I'm not overeating, in fact I'm only eating one small and one regular meal a day, and I'm definitely still in ketosis, rarely ever going past 10g of carbs a day. So, what am I doing wrong? I do have to say there is not much fat left in my body, but there definitely still is. Is it time to stop and switch to a normal low calorie diet? I did notice that it took longer to drop the initial 5kg than the first time I did the diet.

&amp;#x200B;

Now to problem number 2. I have severe ADHD and take medication (since recently). Quite strong one, at that. One of the side effects of the medication is dehydration. It's bad enough outside the diet, but on top on keto, it's a nightmare. I have a few concerns because I've never mixed the two before now. Could my medication be affecting my diet and vice-versa?  (Not medical advice, just asking if it's a reason to stop the diet.)

Been going great. Today i unfortunately cut myself washing dishes and got stitches. After 15 minutes since the injury, we were still cleaning the wound cause it kept bleeding everything was turning white and cloudy, hearing got muffled. I swear i thought i was going to die. I blacked out for a few seconds and was sweating like crazy. Once i came back, color wasn’t coming back yet so i had to scarf down some left over fries and tacos my sister fortunately had just got home with. Ate the food &amp; Drank Gatorade zero on the way to the ER and started to feel better.
I’m assuming it was cause of the low blood pressure that i fainted. Doctor said it was most likely vasovagal, regardless of being bother by blood or not, it still happens. But i don’t think it was that. I mean sort of but i really thought i was going to die. Like i said the colors started changing and looking out the window it was really white and cloudy, i could barely even see my neighbors window when usually i could their entire house, chimney, fence and even the apartment complex on the other side of them. my hearing was practically gone. I couldnt understand my family when they were trying to talk to me. It all sounded very quiet and it didn’t happen instantly. This all happened with in a few minutes. I’ve never heard of anyone taking their time to faint...

I don’t really know the point of this. Not trying to bash keto, it helped me a lot. I broke the diet today and ate whatever i wanted (without going overboard) cause it really scared me. I don’t have a reliable source or guidance so I’m just winging it over here. :/ 

I’m really concerned about this diet with all the diabetes stuff i can’t get answered to. I only use sources that support keto but all i get is people telling me “don’t listen to haters”, keto supporter isn’t a hater... or “read the FAQs”. Yeah i did and it’s says the FAQs is not a doctor so do it at my own risk. 

Again, I’m not trying to bash but I guess I’m just really sad now i might have to give up keto. I lost 14lbs so I’m proud of that. Doctor said it’s fine to keep going but didn’t really go into. All they were trying to do is get me in and out of there.

My question is regarding the amount of Kool-Aid I make sweetened with pure sucralose powder. The idea of using the powder because of the maltodextrin has been vilified a ton it seems when I talk to people so I'm just asking here for clarification :)  


 For the [Blue Raspberry Lemonade Kool-Aid](https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/2c726085-4fab-4745-88fe-0f8145f6c860.93bc05d0c57f82606b4315ee6dbe3e0f.jpeg) I noticed Maltodextrin is after Sodium, so each serving has 10mg minimum of Maltodextrin because there's 10mg of sodium in each serving. Preceding Maltodextrin is Calcium Phosphate, and if you look at the calcium at the bottom it says it provides 2% of the daily RDA. Under the RDA's guideline for Calcium, it says that 1300mg should be taken in daily. 2% of this 1300mg RDA 26mg.   


So if we assume there's 25mg of Maltodextrin in each serving, that would make 125mg per packet right? So a gallon=2packets = 250mg of maltodextrin. Even if I were to drink two gallons a day, that'd leave me at 500mg or half a gram of Maltodextrin (or half a carb) a day form kool-aid, right?   


Is the ill response to these powders accurate because I'm missing something? I feel like I'm not understanding a specific concept or guesstimating the right amounts of ingredients. I mean, the [Cherry Variety](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/919Gey0CqJL._SL1500_.jpg) doesn't even have Maltodextrin in it. I originally got into this because it was suggested insulin resistance (because of things like the koolaid I make) is the culprit of why the last of my lower stomach feels like its been in the ""pre-whoosh"" stage for 2 months now and has what feels like the consistency of a water bed and extremely squishy.

So.. I started keto last March. I lost 100 lbs in 6 months. I've been maintaining it and losing a lil more here and there. I want to lose about 50 more pounds.

My problem arises now because I've become stagnant. I've hit that pesky plateau. I was looking into calorie deficit but I'm scared because I have PCOS. Carbs/sugar don't do well in my system and I gain weight super fast. I just wanted to see, if I were to switch to a calorie deficit, would I gain weight back due to the PCOS? I know that calorie deficit works, I've seen it, but sugars/carbs don't agree with me.

I know factually, that quite a bit of the time on keto I was not in a calorie deficit - I lost a lot of weight really fast and I was eating whatever I wanted (That was keto, but portions and calories didn't matter. I was just dropping weight like crazy.) I also didn't exercise. 

Now I take walks etc and try to do what I can to help with weight loss but I've been the same weight for a few months. I'm still doing keto so it's frustrating because it's always worked for me. I wanted to see how calorie deficit would work for me (if it would) but I'm scared bc of the PCOS. It feeds and thrives with sugar in my body and I am so worried about gaining weight back. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think if I swap to CD I'll lose, regardless of PCOS?

Just wanted a place to put this out there. Long story short, been keto before and successfully lost 30 lbs. had a baby and gained it all back, and then some. I’ve been off and on since a couple months post-partum and have just been too stressed/overwhelmed/exhausted for it to stick. Little one is almost 10 months and although teething is *killing* us right now, we’re in a decent spot. Given this, I hopped back on this past Monday and have been successful again. Lost about 5 lbs, feeling in control with only a few hard moments that I ultimately defeated. 

However, in one night I gained 3 lbs and I believe this is due to lack of sleep. I fasted until lunch, was within macros, barely over calories, was done eating by 6:45 and had a good 40 minute walk. When all of those things line up, I can expect to lose *something* based on all of my experience. Even if it’s .5 lbs. it’s something. 

Well. I gained 3.2 lbs and I can guarantee you it’s because I slept on the couch last night and got just about zero sleep. My baby girl had a rough night and when that’s the case AND my husband is home (he works nights) I will go to the couch. This is because he’s up most of the night because his own sleep is completely jacked due to work and he can’t stand to hear her cry. To honestly make it easier for everyone, I go to the living room and close the door so he can’t hear her and I don’t feel pressure to go against the sleep training I’ve successfully done with her. 

Most of the time, I don’t have that much trouble getting some sleep but last night I just couldn’t get right.

In the past decade, weight loss formulas have come to dominate the supplement market, which is worth billions of dollars globally. The United States is generally considered the biggest consumer of weight loss supplements, but much of the world harbors love for supplementation. At its core, the appeal of a weight loss pill is easy to understand. Taking a supplement can help to maximize the effectiveness of your existing weight loss routine.

Regardless of how much (or how little) you exercise, it’s always possible to improve the efficiency of your workouts and fat-burning routine. The basic outline for any weight loss process should be the creation of a caloric deficit. People who burn more calories throughout the day than they consume are bound to lose weight; this is a guarantee. However, metabolism varies from person to person. Some people seem like they can just eat all day long and never gain weight. Others just look at a piece of cake and seem to gain five pounds.

While popular media outlets may brand all weight loss supplements as scams. While we do realize that many consumers have had bad experiences in this explosive contemporary sector, some weight loss formulas are packed with efficient ingredients capable of supercharging your weight loss work. The Okinawa Flat Belly Tonic is part of this tradition; the supplement claims that it can help people of all ages and weights regain control of their diets.

The formula’s powerful ingredients have been scientifically shown to help people lose more weight. Utilizing GMP, or Good Manufacturing Practices, the company behind the Okinawa Flat Belly Tonic claims that they specially craft each bottle of their supplement for maximum effectiveness. As always, it isn’t easy to find out the truth about a given supplement. The internet is full of sites trying to hype up supplements and wehttps://linktr.ee/Mayank21

Figured my weight had some role in that so I started looking into keto after a niece had some success with it. I have a job that keeps me in the car most of the day and was eating fast food almost every day.  I had no idea my current weight because my wife's bathroom scale wouldn't go that high. Was guessing I was around 325-330. Started researching the diet, read the FAQ, tried a few recipes, and ordered a new scale. It arrived on the evening of 12/28. I weighed myself after dinner (I know) and was surprised to see I was 350.6 lbs! Yes, I needed to lose weight. 

I officially started keto on 1/1/21 at 343.4lbs. I initially bought way too much food because I wasn't yet sure how much I'd eat on a given day. I know the recommendation is to do a 20% deficit, but I went with 35% and have maintained that throughout. That gives me a low fat macro and about 1500 calories per day (now). That's a big step down from before when I'd sometimes have 4000 calories in one meal (I'm not kidding).  I started with simple meals. Eventually tried a few recipes - some I liked and some I didn't. I've now gotten into a pretty good routine and vary my dinners through different meats and veggies while keeping brunch about the same each day. 

I've had a few week-long stalls along the way. I don't eat out hardly at all anymore and when I do it usually leads to a slight weight gain despite reading menu nutrition charts and keeping my numbers down. After one fairly long stall I decided to try a fast (only water) - 11pm Sunday to 2pm Tuesday - and that helped a lot to get it started again. 

On 4/1 I weighed 291 lbs! No April Fools there! If I can keep up the 15-lb/mo loss rate, then I'll be at my initial goal of 210 by Halloween. According to the height/weight charts, my ideal weight is about 180 lbs. Not sure if that's doable or desired, but I'll decide when I get close to the first goal. 

For a long time I made excuses that dieting cost too much because healthy food costs more than unhealthy food and I'm not wealthy. It's cheaper to buy a pack of hot dogs and a box of mac n cheese than broccoli and chicken. Well, that's true, but I've found I have more money in the bank now than I did then. I might go spend $150 at the grocery store (usually less) but then I feed myself two meals per day for two weeks or more. Compare that to a $15 (or more) every day in the drive thru (for one meal) in the same timeframe at $210+.

I've finally convinced my wife to try it as she's been wanting to lose some weight (5'0"" at 127 lbs) and she started on 4/1 at a 20% deficit. She committed to 30 under 20 for now, then she'll decide if she wants to continue. She's a big bread, chocolate, and milk fan so I'm finding some subs for her.

Anyhoo... I'm pleased with the progress so far. I've gone down 2 pants sizes and am close to going down another. Had to buy a new belt. My seatbelt isn't as tight as it used to be.

I started at 265 pounds, eating probably close to 3000 calories a day, if not more. Even back in my college athletics days (I was a rower for a D1 club team) my relationship with food, to put it lightly, was a coping mechanism.

Feeling sad? Eat.

Feeling depressed? Eat.

Bored? Eat.

It wasn't healthy, and I knew I needed to change something.

So after doing a lot of research, I determined keto was the best fit for me, and even though it's recommended to ""slowly transition"" in, I just went full-in. I count my macros and weigh food out, and at the beginning, it was hard fighting the urges to cheat. But I didn't give in, and as time went on, the cravings went away. I started walking more, and just getting outside in general. 

And after over a month, I realized something: I don't need to eat to feel better, or just because I'm bored. I need to eat when I'm hungry to live, and yea I can snack from time to time, but food is for sustenance, not something to pass the time. And in that epiphany, I realized why keto works for me: it cut out my cravings and made me feel fuller, longer. It made me genuinely take stock of what I eat, and get smarter about what I'm putting in my body. 

My goal is 200, and as of today I'm down to 238, but what impresses me the most is not that weight loss, it's that keto has made my relationship with food into a healthy one!

I have been on Keto for almost four years now.  I can talk about all the benefits I've had if someone wants to hear, but I'm really here to ask for some advice regarding micro-nutrients.

I'm prone to having anxiety attacks, unfortunately.  I've read a lot about them and Keto has helped me quite a bit.  But, I still feel that I'm not getting all of the micro-nutrients that I need.  I currently take a Kirkland brand multi-vitamin daily, I take some magnesium supplements, vit-D, and B12.  I also use Ultima electrolytes on most days.

Some days I get this amazing sleep and that is the main problem.  I don't get good sleep, generally.  I have an Apple watch so I track the sleep, hours, deep sleep, etc.  I got 10 hours of sleep and almost 2 hours of deep sleep.  When I get good sleep like this, I feel so much better.

Yesterday, I had a carb day.  We had sushi so I ate two rolls, and a few potstickers (gyoza).  I use soy sauce on sushi and such.  

I'm wondering if I'm missing something in my supplements that I need for good sleep and overall well-being.  I've had high sugar days too and that doesn't work well for ""carbs"" but I'm thinking that the high carbs like the rice were a good thing?  Maybe there is something in it that I'm not getting enough of?

I tried keto first time in august 2020. It lasted 2 weeks because I went to an event where I had some high carb meal and yeah... Btw, I had no flu during those 2 weeks, only some insomnia the first 3 days then I slept like a baby.

Yesterday I tried again: I had some chicken breast, avocado and eggs at lunch and then, 8 hours later at night I was sick af. Terrible headache (nape included) and this urge to vomit. I was full of sweating and in the same time I was cold.

In the end I vomited 3 times a yellow liquid and after every vomit I had this bitter flavor in my mouth. I guess it was all from my gall (first time for me btw).

Idk if the amount was a problem and that's why I was sick: I ate at a deficit caloric and I had 500g chicken breast, 300g avocado (6 mini avocados) and 4 eggs. I'd go for more vegetables but I'm scared of carbs.

Now I'm laying in my bed with a headache (but without an urge to vomit or some cold sweating) thinking about what should I do. What do you think? Should I just continue with the same meal or should I eat something ""lighter"" like chicken breast + vegetables only?

First time posting, long time lurker. 
I am very embarrassed to be here asking what appears to be the most common question. 
But here I am...

I have been doing Keto since Dec 1, 2020 and have lost 18 pounds. I am very happy with my progress so far, but after 7 weeks I am completely stuck. My weight has not fluctuated more than two pounds during what I believe to be a plateau. 

My stats are 30(F) 5’10” 159lbs. 
I would like to get down to around 140lbs. 

My macros are 118g fats, 15g net carbs, and 62g protein. 
My TDEE is 1837 approx. 

Prior to these stagnant 7 weeks, I was consuming no more than 1200 calories. 

This is what I have tried:
For two weeks I increased my calorie limit to 1600, and my weight did not change. (This was the last time I saw a difference in my physical measurements) 

The past two weeks, I have been consuming no more than 1000 calories and my weight has not changed. 

I am always around half (or less) for fat consumption, never above my carb limit, but average around 80/90g protein daily. 

I have yet to eat one bite off program. I weigh everything with a scale. 

I do not exercise, but I am a horse trainer and am riding for about 5 hours a day/5 days a week, absolute minimum. I have no idea how to calculate what my expenditure would be so I don’t factor that info in. 
Side note: I have been having a hard time working during these past two weeks with my lowered calorie limit. I am frequently dizzy, even with adding additional sodium and electrolytes. Hoping that will go away soon...

I am very embarrassed to be asking this question, but please help. This is my first attempt at Keto and I intend to give it my all. Am I being overzealous? Any advice is very much appreciated.

Some of my favorites and their net carbs per serving in parentheses:

Pasta Sauce: Rao's Homemade Marinara Sauce (5g, better than most sugary sauces IMO)

Milk: Kroger® CARBmaster® Ultra Filtered Non-Fat Original Milk (3g, I don't like the taste of nut milks and so drink this instead every so often)

Chocolate: Lily's Milk Chocolate Style Salted Caramel Bar (2g, I recommend this whole brand but I enjoy this product specifically)

Sandwich Bread: Outer Aisle Cauliflower Sandwich Thins (2g, this is not ""bread"" but its great for when you want to make a sandwich, can be used for mini pizzas as well)

Ice Cream: (net carbs vary by flavor) I've tried Halo Top, Enlightened, Rebel, and other less known brands. I'd say Rebel is the best, followed by Enlightened, followed by Halo Top. Halo Top to me is more *creamed ice* than ice cream. This is somewhat of a problem with all these brands, but I'd say Halo Top has the worst texture overall.  Enlightened and Rebel are both pretty good, I gave the edge to Rebel due to flavor choices being more to my liking. I am actually going to try making my own ice cream soon which I'm sure will be better than all of these options. Still, these are good to know for when you're lazy.

Frozen Products:

In the support groups I'm in (outside Reddit) it feels like I have more to lose than anyone else. Everyone else seems to have so much less to lose (most want to lose up to 30-45kg (66-100lbs)) and their advice/experience is often so different to mine and doesn't help me as much as I'd like because someone of my size has different issues (physically/mentally/emotionally) to face. It's extremely difficult to explain the differences to them because they just aren't this big and it's usually very small differences so they brush it off as insignificant (it's not to me) and that makes me feel very alienated.

&amp;#x200B;

1. How much did you lose and how long did it take you? What type of keto (dirty/strict/lazy/clean) and was it only keto or did you do other things to help along the way?
2. How has maintenance been if you're there? Did you transition to another way of eating? Did things get harder as you approached your goal weight?
3. Do you work out? When did you decide to start working out and for what reasons?
4. When did you start noticing you were actually getting smaller? Specifically in the belly region which is so far the least changed part of me measurement wise.
5. Is there anything you wished you knew when you started that would have made things easier for you to lose weight or keep it off? 
6. What was your biggest struggle? How did you face plateaus and days where you just felt like it was impossible to get to/be your goal? I don't often struggle with this but when I do it's very hard because I don't know many people who have this much to loose, so I can't look to them and say they did it I can too.
7. Did you have insulin resistance and if so did it clear up or are you still watchful? Is there anything health wise I should be watchful for while losing weight?

I have always weighed a lot, when I am stick thin I weigh 165 pounds, I mean I am happy to lose another 10 pounds give or take but I am not fussed about it.  I am happy with my body where I am at.  I had sort of hoped that losing so slowly and using ample cream (and I mean seriously, I could not be more effing hydrated), would aid in not having so much loose skin, and maybe it did, but not enough... My loose skin is an actual problem.

This is going to be so much TMI, but we're all in the same boat here right?  My loose skin is a hygiene problem.  As we're getting into the warmer months here, I am struggling to keep under the flaps of skin dry, like we’re one hot month away from there being a smell situation.  My belly button is already questionable.  I don’t know how to talk about this with people I know, so I turned to the internet like everyone else does.  I'd like to think that if it were just an aesthetics thing, I would be happier with the situation, but I am honestly not sure how long I would be willing to play Tetris with skin to put on clothes before I considered surgery even without the present hygiene issue.  I know many people who lost more weight than I did and didn’t end up with as much, I suppose everyone is different.  I'm not unhappy with my body per se...  But it's hard to be super excited about losing 100 pounds and buying your first bikini when you have to do a puzzle of how to place your skin inside it every time.

But I want to know, has anyone here considered surgery?  Have you gotten it?  What should I expect?  What are some things you’re curious about if you haven’t had it?

SO, today I saw my Dr. and we're starting to reduce the meds *(the good NSV)* with the goal of eliminating them in the near future, because I keep getting readings of 100/60 the last few weeks.

While I was there, we discussed that I'm on Keto - she was fine with it, but not a huge fan, but didn't cast any shade on it.

Mental energy is at the top, physical energy varies depending on factors. Since I started OMAD at the same time as keto, I rarely ever have any energy when trying to work out. But I realize that my body just needs to adapt. Overall I feel great.

But a few things worry me. First of all, I experience muscle cramps and somewhat of a headache unless I drink salt water every two hours. I bought some electrolyte powder as well with sodium, magnesium, potassium and sodium. I feel really great after taking that stuff, and I feel like I need to take it probably 3 times per day, and I wouldn't say that I'm really that active right now. I know that you urinate a lot on keto and electrolyte imbalances are a pretty common thing, but my question is; 

**1) Do I need to replenish these amounts of electrolytes all the time when I'm on keto, or does my body kind of adapt to it after a few weeks?** I know it doesn't really work that way, but I figure the body must find a system to kind of keep things in needs, and not flush it, right? I mean I must take a lot of electrolytes just to try to prevent my muscles from twitching. And my joints from hurting and getting stiff.

**2) Does the diarrhoea subside when my body gets fat adapted?** At least yesterday, I had to shit water at least 3 times after my meal. I realize that it's a common side effect during the initial stages of ketosis (or during ""keto flu""), but the body adapts to it, right? I've got some probiotic pills at home, which only usually makes me need to shit more and not necessarily make it better, but I can try those. I ate some saurkraut today with my meal and I hope that it makes some difference. I think there were some undigested pieces today too, yellow/dark yellow pieces, circa 0,5 cm/0,2"".

**3) What are the general symptoms of being dehydrated, except for being thirsty?** Can dehydration cause muscle twitches too etc?

**4) How long time does it take before I can get a little bit of physical energy to work out?** I must be very careful right now, a little too much and I just get generally drained. I don't think working out really is a good idea right now, since I might have muscle catabolism if I do so.

**5) Is a high conjugated bilirubin level bad in combination with keto?** I saw on my recent blood test that I had a pretty high conjugated bilirubin level. All the other liver enzyme levels etc were all fine. But is this worries me slightly, since the liver is part of what metabolizes fat, or the primary part  in the process.

All that changed when a suspected heart attack (I was only 27) turned out to be severe heart inflammation, caused by the mature cheeses and cured meats I was using as snacks. 

After that I've been eating clean meats, dairy, fats, leafy greens etc, but constantly been in and out of illnesses, fevers, etc. 

Long story short, I've found the root of the problem years late, coffee! It has seriously been messing me up to the point where I developed a fistula, the dreaded beginning of Crohn's. It still hasn't been fixed after 2 years, although the pandemic didn't help. 

My question is, am I able to live healthily on keto if my diet consists of meat, leafy greens like broccoli, butter, and peppers/onions/asparagus for flavouring? I can add macadamia nuts in too for a snack, as they are well tolerated. 

I have ketoaide supplemented to make up the minor shortcomings when it comes to electrolytes too, and the food itself is well salted. 

Each day has around 100g of butter total added to meals, in addition to using fatty meats such as chicken thigh and beef shin. It's also the only way I can add variety by switching meats. 

Sorry for the long post, but if I eat this way in addition to keeping on top of electrolytes and supplements, I should be fine right?

Symptoms of my illnesses have reduced significantly since switching to clean fresh foods and avoiding fermented products such as coffee and cured meat. I just want to make sure I won't be killing myself by eating like this!

Journey so far. I started keto on 12-2019, I was 326 lbs and noticed my quality of life was poor. I went to a Dr who does medically supervised weight loss and I knew if I followed his instructions I would have success. I already knew lots about it, but he taught me all about the keto diet and told me to follow the carb/protein/fat numbers he set for me, and gave me basically a large FAQ folder to take with me. For the first couple months I saw him every two weeks, with weigh ins that provided a printout of my progress with nifty little graphs and all. We would talk about what kinds of things I was eating, how I was feeling, etc. and would be a coach/counselor/cheerleader. Once I was adapted to the lifestyle we moved to 3 weeks between appointments. I looked forward to my time with him and tried to avoid weighing myself outside of his office so it felt like a treat to see my new number. Once I had lost a good amount of weight, and my energy was high, he got me to start working out. I got a gym membership and was going 3-4 days a week!  I loved my gym days and was shocked that it had taken me so long to go. Everything was going perfect, then, Covid. I was actually at the gym when I got the text that they would be closing indefinitely in a few hours. No biggie, I went to the store on my way home to buy resistance bands medicine balls among other things to work out in my garage. I got everything set up, and never used it once. Going to my garage to work out didn’t have the same feel of going to the gym, and I just couldn’t do it. It’s ok though, I’ll just stick to the diet. By this time, no in person Dr appointments allowed. So I could no longer weigh in and get my cool graphs. I tried zoom style appointments but it wasn’t the same. I kept eating keto and on April 30, 2020 I was 262 lbs. 64 pounds lost in less than 5 months!!!! Incredible!!!  Well that was the lowest number I would see on the scale. I slowly started cheating here and there, mostly for comfort in this crazy new world we were in. Before long I was 100% off keto. For a long time I stayed pretty close to my lowest weight, I had learned about portion control, only eating when I needed to and stopping when my body told me to. Eventually I fell back into over eating, eating for fun, and comfort, and to satiate boredom. Pounds started rising and me new clothes got tight. I didn’t step on a scale for a long time. 1-1-2021, I stepped on a scale...312.  I was so upset and disappointed, I promised myself I would never go back to where I started. The next morning, I was 100% keto! I dropped down to 295 quick, and stayed there, for about 3 weeks. What was I doing wrong?  I soon realized I was using all the “keto” “low carb” products from the grocery store. I cut those all out and went back to basics. Meat, cheese, eggs, avocado, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts. That’s it, only thing I will put in my body. Today I am 272 and 10 lbs away from my first goal of getting back to where I was a year ago. I am hoping to hit my goal of 262 by April 30, the date I hit 262 last year.  I just want to end by saying thank you to everyone who shares their stories here. I read them often and you all give me tons of motivation. Sorry for the long post, but it’s been a long journey so far.

I’m bigger so weighing myself has never been high on my to do list. The last time I knew my weight was when I went to the doctor for a checkup about 6 months ago. 

I started Keto 6 weeks ago and I’m loving it so far. When I started I did not intend on using my scale since I figured my goal would be “drop a shirt/pant size” rather than numbers. But I’ve been feeling so good that I decided to break out the scale about a month in. I was down 30 pounds from my last known weight. And I’ve been weighing every week and now I’m down 44 pounds according to my scale but my clothes still basically fit the same. The pants are a little looser but that’s it. 

Is this normal? Should I try a different scale?

The last 10 days have been especially amazing for me.

I am so excited to see strong progress lately. [As I mentioned in my 3-months-in (well, just short of 3 months) first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/mce27a/my_keto_journey_thus_far_3_months_in_long/) in /r/keto, I had experienced. pretty strong progress though with some periods of frustrating (though expected, per the FAQ) slow loss. I recently realized, however, that I was probably sabotaging my progress somewhat; despite being fairly strict and tracking my intake somewhat regularly, I was eating unaccounted-for nuts and breaking my intermittent-fasting with late-night Scotch (double-whammy, calories + the interrupted IF). Needless to say I wasn't adding those nuts or drinks to my log in MFP.

Starting on 3/21 I started tracking every nut (in addition to everything else I'm eating) and stopped drinking as much, and definitely no more IF-busting drinks. The nut-tracking isn't as bad as it sounds - using my scale I know that 2 toasted pecans is about 5g, and 2 almonds is about 2g, so it's fairly easy to track that in MFP in my head now without the scale.

Coincidence or not, you can see a marked improvement in the rate of loss since 3/21, really kicking in on 3/26 where the weight started falling off. The only thing I really changed was what I mentioned above. **That's almost 5lbs in the 10 days since 3/25!** 

My caloric intake is lower since 3/21 overall, but I'm still hitting my protein macro of about 120g/day

Thanks to /r/keto! It's great to see everyone else's  struggles and triumphs, and posting helps me stay accountable to myself.

Could it be that I'd need bile supplements? My naturopath prescribed me digestive enzymes and I also need to take a few natural treatments for my leaky gut.   
Recap of supplements: zinc, digestive enzymes, magnesium and probiotics for the intestines. 

I know I should be seeing this with a doctor, but I just find it weird my naturopath not suggesting something to support the liver/pancreas. :D

Like many others I've been doing pretty much zero exercise throughout the lockdowns and currently sticking to the below macros:

**FAT &amp; PROTEIN** \- 115-125g (usually around 63% FAT and 28% PROTEIN)  
**CARBS** \- 15g-20g  
**KCAL -** 1600

My BMR is 1727, I'm 187lb, 36 years old, 182cm. I'm now looking at introducing quite heavy exercise three times a week - likely burning between 800 and 1200 calories each time. The obvious principle would be to eat more calories on my exercise days but is this necessary? It would be difficult to take onboard those additional calories whilst staying in my MACROS and not completely changing my meal plans. As my calorie deficit is relatively small as it is, should I just continue as is?

Okay, quickest backstory: obese my whole adult life. In 2014-2016, I had lost 60lbs/27kg with Keto. (You can see in my post history how well I had done once). Moved to Korea in 2016, gained everything back plus a little more (and hypothyroidismㅠㅠ)

Anyway!

Since March 2020, I started fixing my habits again. I’ve been Keto since November 2020!

As of today, I’ve lost 63lbs/28.5kg! I’m 7lbs away from getting back to my low weight a few years ago, but still have much more to lose from there.

BUT THE NSV is something I could only feel in Korea...!!

Koreans are quite... truthful lol when it comes to weight. Sometimes brutally honest ㅋㅋ They are also just generally thinner, and there’s a high expectation for appearances here. So being obese in a country like Korea has been extra rough on my self-esteem (but I’m working through that, don’t worry!). I’m still AT LEAST 54lbs/24.4kg away from a “healthy” weight. So I didn’t expect comments for a while, but good lord at least I’m feeling amazing again, finally. 


I catch the bus to work in the morning and always wait with a middle-aged woman who lives near me. I’m talking over 4 years of us waiting together. She doesn’t speak English, and I speak kindergarten Korean at best. I understand more than I can say, but we always manage to have little “chats”. She takes care of me like picking cat hairs off my shirts, holding an umbrella over me, etc. It’s a cute relationship we have!

This week, she asks me (always in Korean) if I’ve lost weight!! I was SHOCKED she noticed AND said something! I told her how much, explained “no carbs” and “no exercise yet” haha. She was amazed. Today (a few days later), she said again how pretty I look and then tells me she didn’t eat carbs for dinner this week and she is happy she’s no longer bloated! I INSPIRED MY MIDDLE-AGED KOREAN BUS AUNTIE!

THEN. Tonight, I pop into my local convenience store. The woman who works there has witnessed first hand my absolutely horrendously trash diet for years. Carbs, microwave meals, crisps, bottles of wine... I don’t go in as often anymore because I cook at home and don’t drink right now. But I needed paper towels. 

Again, she does not speak English and I do not speak nearly enough Korean. But she asks me if I’ve lost weight!! And again, I tell her how much and that I eat Keto and she’s amazed and so kind and complimentary. 

I know I’m still obese. I stand out as a foreigner anyway, never mind being overweight. But like... my Korean neighbours are noticing and are proud of me. Despite the language barrier, they are making effort to comment! None of my Korean co-workers have commented yet. I’m curious when or if... haha. 

Also, bonus NSV: I just want to give myself props for finally taking the time to commit to learning how to do Keto long-term in Korea. I did it! I get it now! It’s actually become intuitive for me and that feels great.

I was diagnosed with PCOS when I was 14 (I guess?) and hypothyroidism around at age 12. Thanks to these 2 conditions and gorgeous genes (/s)I gained weight rapidly through the years, to the point where I ended up obese by age 16/17. I have seen numerous endocrinologists and all they have to offer is birth control pills and metformin for PCOS and meds for thyroid. While thyroid pills never seemed to bug me, BCs basically took a toll on my mental health and I guess led to me gain more weight. And another excellent advice all of them gave was to reduce weight, which by the way didn’t happen even on a 1100 cal diet with 1 hour at the gym in the evenings and 3-4 km runs in the morning. Whatever little I lost, I always gained double that in less than half the duration. With all of this, I lost confidence in myself and developed tonnes of insecurities. My mom constantly reminding me that I’m fat, lazy, slow, hairy, useless etc doesn’t help either. 

In the beginning of 2020, I tried keto as it looked like the only way I could control my PCOS symptoms. It worked decently and I lost close to 13 kgs (~ 28 lbs) in 2-2.5 months. For me, that was a lot since I never lost that much weight before. Due to the pandemic and not having enough supplies, I had to stop keto and get back to a “regular” diet. A year went by and thanks to my chronic illnesses, I gained back all 13 and 3 kgs more.

On 2nd of March, I was determined and started the keto again. So far, I just lost 6 kgs (~ 13 lbs) most of which must be water weight. I don’t know what’s going wrong but I can’t seem to lose weight. I also have a lot of physical fatigue. As my mom says something that triggers me, I end up not eating as much as I probably should. I consumed a total of ~850 calories yesterday. For someone my size, that’s really less. This leaves me with practically no energy to workout. I’m trying to eat more often but I just can’t seem to get hungry. I believe I’m not on ketosis. Could you suggest ways consume more fat in smaller meals or any other advice? Not being able to lose weight through the only way that works for me is so painful. I want to at least get to 70kgs (~155 lbs) by this August. Any advice would be highly appreciated!

I supplement with minerals as I feel my body needs them.  With Pink salt and bone broth probably at least once every other day.

I do a 24 hour fast once a week, mainly because I end up just not being hungry (I don't count my keto coffees during the fast.)

I have (2) 16 ounce homemade keto coffees a day, 3 tbsp spoons of heavy cream, a tbsp of organic cacao powder, 2 scoops of HMVN collagen w/ MCT's and a good few shakes of organic Cinnamon.

I'm no stranger to working out, it was my life 20 years ago.  My ankles and calves would swell to the point my socks would put a 2 inch indent.  Now my ankles look boney....

My electrolytes per day are: 

5000mg sodium
2500mg potassium
800mg magnesium

Water is about 8 cups day (sometimes more if I'm thirsty, but felt I was drinking too much before and losing electrolytes.)

My macros are 10-15 carbs, 75-85mg protein, and 100mg+ fat. 

My keto is for medical purposes (migraine) and not weightloss, so I try to do a 1:1 fats to carb/protein ratio, so I can be 1.5+ ketones.

My weight is 120lbs, I'm 5'3"", and calories around 1500.

Anyway, since starting, I've been extreamely fatigued and sleepy. And it hasn't let up. I have not cheated, even once.

My feeling is maybe eventually when I'm ""fat adapted,"" this will change, but it's been a struggle.

I also wanted to mention that I have Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (autoimmune thyroid disease).
I took my TSH and t4 yesterday and they have indeed went up from last month (but are still in range.)

All my electrolytes and triglycerides look good.

I was thinking about asking for a t3 reading from my endocrinologist (since keto is known to lower that--though I'm not sure of the significance since I'm not using carbs.)

Anyway, do you think it's just that I'm not fat adapted yet?

Or maybe a thyroid issue? Does anyone else have thyroid issues who does this diet?

The last few days were the first days since keto that I actually stopped feeling ridiculously hungry.
So I take that as maybe a sign I'm starting to get fat adapted. Idk.

After a couple week self imposed plateau, I've wandered into One-derland!

I discovered the fasting subreddit.  My first 42 hour fast broke my plateau and helped teach me to eat slowly and smaller.  I also incorporated \~ 9000 steps per day at this time.  This pushed my weight from 210 - 205.  Recently, I started a journey based entirely in lunacy - I was inspired by the folks at /r/fasting to begin a 7 day fast.  I'm on day 4, although it has been a bit dirty, I've had 3 drinks over those 90 hours, but otherwise very successful!  I've ramped my walking effort up from 9000 steps to the 10k - 15k range, but I won't be sustaining that over a longer period of time.  I dropped from 205.6 at the start of the fast to 198.8 this morning.  I know much of that is water weight (which is puzzling, since I've been pretty good about being keto for 2 months), but it felt amazing to step on the scale and see a 1 in the hundreds digit!  I'm hoping that in the following 3.5 days, I can lose enough mass to stay in the 190s after breaking fast.

I'm posting this here because... frankly, I couldn't dream of getting nearly 4 days into a fast without keto.  Given the voracious hunger, I would have broke on day 1, day 2 at best.  Overall, I've lost about 25 pounds in 2 and a half months.  My prediction for onderland was the first week of April and I seem to have beaten that mark by one day.

I hope everyone is doing well thus far. 

I apologize in advance if this has been previously inquired upon. 

I have been fasting regularly and I have a regimented schedule consistently for roughly 2 years now. 

I get up at 3:30am everyday and in the home gym by 4:00am. My workouts consists of light cardio (bike,rower,jump rope rope) for about 30minutes and another 30minutes doing mobility/flexibility work. Then about an hour of weight lifting(not bodybuilding) and some CrossFit’esq type workout. 

During this activity, I am in a fasted state which I will break around 11:00am-12:00pm. Which translates to about 18 hours of fasting. 

My question, during this ketosis state my body is in, if I get a cholesterol check will it register an elevated result?

I am 45 years old and I consider my diet low to mid in saturated fat. 

I eat red meat once a month and do not regularly consume processed food.

I decided to do something differently with my tracking this around. I was using Fitness Tracker, which was fine, but the problem I had was that I would eat something that “seemed” keto and then track it, sometimes not until the end of the day or even the following morning. Even when I thought I was in good shape for the day, I often found myself in the 30-40 gm territory from sneaky carb content. 

Meal planning would help address this; but I am someone who really has a hard time eating things I’m not on the mood for. And I tend to graze out of the fridge for most of my meals; I only really cook proper meals on the weekend. Otherwise it’s just throwing together a plate of meat, cheese, and whatever else looks good. 

My solution is to compile a spreadsheet of the keto foods I like best and eat most. I captured their net carbs per my typical serving. I categorized them by general type and in order of what I should be eating (protein, veg, seed/nut, fat, condiment, fruit). Then I sorted the contents with in each category from most to least net carbs per my typical serving. 

Because it’s on my computer screen, it’s easy to track throughout the day, and then I can easily see what my balance of net carbs is and then look at my options by scanning the top and middle of each category when I’m running low on carbs. By keeping protein at the top, I’m channeling my snacking on that direction since I can scan the list until something looks good, starting with proteins (versus scanning my fridge and starting with cheese or hot dogs).

A ketogenic lifestyle consists of eating the ketogenic way: low carb, high healthy fat, and moderate protein 99 percent of the time - even if it’s your birthday. What does it mean to eat ketogenic, though? Well, basically you eat in such a way that your body produces ketones. Don’t worry, this is not scary; in fact, ketones can protect your brain from Alzheimer’s and other problems, such as brain fog and memory. What if you started eating the way your ancestors used to eat? What would that look like? When you consider what your ancestors did not have, namely processed food, you can see what that might look like. The food around was that which was easily available such as berries, wild animals, and vegetables that are easy to grow like spinach, cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower. Because it was hard to catch food, they also had to ensure everything they ate was as high in fat as possible so that they could keep on enough weight to be healthy. But not fake fat, of course - healthy fat from fruit like coconut oil and olive oil. Some people also enjoy ghee, which is clarified butter, in this plan. That’s the other thing that is awesome about the ketogenic lifestyle; you do have lots of leeway in what you eat if it follows the main goals, which are to eat low carb, high fat, and moderate protein most of the time. Processed food is full of refined sugars, unhealthy fats, and chemicals that no one can pronounce and will leave you unsatisfied, always craving more. And guess what; it’s not your fault if you’re always craving more. They made the food that way. The food you’re eating is designed to cause cravings. Processed food is made to hook you on it, just like opiates. The food scientists know the exact combinations of fat, salt, and sugar to hook you. They’ve found the formula to make every meal into a drug. What’s worse is that this drug will make you fat, unhealthy, prone to diabetes and you’ll likely die earlier than you otherwise would. Even when you think you’re eating small amounts of food called ""diet"" food, you can be fat and very unhealthy. In fact, thin people whoare eating a fully processed diet are also very unhealthy and prone to illness. Disease manifests differently in everyone. Thankfully, the ketogenic diet has become more mainstream. People are taking to it and getting healthier. They’re getting healthier because it’s simple. They don’t have to think too hard to know whether they can have that food or not. Due to this fact, it makes it easy for the ketogenic way of eating to become a full-on lifestyle. That’s good, because one thing that can ensure that people really change for life, and make eating keto a habit, is to turn it into a lifestyle. When you know you’re going to live this way forever, that you’re not taking breaks, and that you’re not doing it for just the next few weeks until the big party, then you tend to stick to a healthier way of eating because it’s just normal and natural.

Been on keto two weeks, still overeating on keto. Got metallic taste in mouth and realizing that’s a sign I’m in ketosis. Wondering if my appetite will decrease with time considering I am doing keto correctly this time.

Hey! From my other posts, I described my struggle with binge eating.. The reason why I am posting it here is because I noticed my binge eating got worse when I started “keto” months ago, and I am assuming because I kept going on and off+added many sweeteners to my diet which I cut all out. Anyways I am now doing stricter keto and am trusting the process. I want to say that these cravings are carb cravings, because I will eat and wait it out and still want to eat. But I am not certain, it could just be psychological.

I am two weeks in. I started the first week eating 3500-5500 keto. I know it’s crazy, I don’t know how or why I have such a big appetite. It’s NOT hunger, they are cravings. My appetite has reduced a little, I have few days I eat under 1500, but it fluctuates from 2000-3500 if I’m being honest. I am drinking water, but it’s seriously getting insane. I am 170ish 5’8bfemale. 

Anyways, you know that feeling when you are hungry, but you genuinely don’t mind eating? Like you feel satisfied with very little food. I’m trying to get that. I know some people will say “maybe keto is not for you” but then again, carbs will make me go even crazier, ESPECIALLY sugar, lol. So there is no point in me not doing this, especially since I am counting carbs far more strictly. Plus carbs make me tired. At least I can over eat and not want to fall asleep after a meal hahaha. I do exersice enough to maintain my muscle but that’s about it

So what I wanted to ask, was should I just trust the process? These cravings are insane and I’m trying to find out if they are carb cravings or if I just need to find some help with my history of binging / starving. I used to be able to lose weight easily, but that is not the case anymore, and I’m not sure why. Because I don’t simply lose all control around food, I eat and I wait it out , and when I realize I still have cravings, that’s what adds up the calories and causes me to overeat. It’s not like I come home and just eat everything in sight. 

But I wanted to share, today for the first time, I tasted that “metallic” taste and my pee smells weird, even water tasted weird. This didn’t stop me from overeating a lot, but it was a sign that I am in ketosis. 

So what do you guys think? Do you think that if I wait it out these cravings will go away? Idk if 2 weeks is long enough for not.I think I kind of got excited to realize that taste in my mouth. I thought “hey, maybe this keto thing is just in the process and your insane appetite will eventually adapt” and I am eating less than the first few days, but still a lot. I can’t control these cravings lol I just need to eat.

Around 6 years ago when I was probably around 17, I lost 40 pounds after discovering keto and it's always held a special place in my heart.  


So I've been hardcore dieting for the last 5 months and because of the strict level of the calories I'm at, I basically have no choice but to do Keto to hit my dietary fat needs and protein goals. My first question is regarding how long I've been holding onto what feels like basically a waterbed like consistency of fat around my mid section/love handles. I'm 23, 6'4 at 180\~lbs so I'm nearing the end here of my cut, but at the same time I just can't seem to drop this portion. I feel like I've had it for the last 2 months at least, but my upper abs have became more visible as well different portions of my body such as much more quad definition/minor striations. So I doubt it's the pre-whoosh effect/squishy fat. It feels nothing like the rest of the fat on my body which is why it's odd to me. In fact, it's EXTREMELY pliable. Almost reminds me of PlayDough or that magic-mud cornstarch mixture that got pretty popular for awhile. Very lost at why my body may be holding it like this.  


On a pretty unrelated note (I think? :\^D) do you guys have any idea about how much maltodextrin is actually in one of [these Kool-Aid packets?](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0055/0984/0947/products/KOOL-AID-UNSWEET-STRAWBERRY-KIWI-Packets-0.17oz-043000955277_16330-_B_grande.jpg?v=1576856176) I drink between a gallon or two a day of kool-aid (so 2-4 packets) mixed with my magnesium and pure, raw sucralose powder.

My husband and I have been off and on Keto for the better part of the last two years. Every time that we've been going strong something happens and we end up going off. The first time was financial reasons, and the past year I've lost my grandmother and my uncle.  It seems like every time something emotional hits it triggers my anxiety and depression disorders and I end up getting some kind of fast food that's unhealthy. We quit this time because I was having near constant panic attacks about family drama and buying our first home. The stress that came along with moving and having t handle family made my husband suggest we use food for comfort while getting through this time. It did help with the panic attacks but now I'm feeling depressed, lethargic and I just need some support. 

The worst part is that I'm fairly certain I'm allergic to nightshades, (Things like Potatoes, Tomatoes, Bell Peppers) because I cut them out completely when on Keto, and whenever we go off Keto I get back my acid reflux, and migraines as well as acne flare-ups. 

I know that it's a mindset issue. Keto helps with my anxiety and depression disorders once I've been into ketosis for about two weeks and I'm feeling rather worthless and awful about myself. If I were good enough, we would have just stayed keto and I'd be on my weight loss journey. Instead, I'm the heaviest I've ever been, my stomach hurts all the time and I'm struggling with my daily life. My parents and siblings have never been supportive emotionally and it's hard to feel alone a lot. My husband is very supportive but whenever he's at work these lonely feelings just creep in. 

I'm not asking for any help in regards to my mindset, I really need to hear some supportive words from a community that understands my daily struggles with self-image and weight loss. We're planning on restarting Keto in a few weeks once we move into our home. 

Thanks for letting me vent a little, even just typing this has helped.

My doctor suggested giving Keto a try because even after adding 5 days of HIIT to my 20 miles a week, and religiously counting calories, I still wasn't making any progress with my weight loss. 

I've been doing keto for about a month (keeping under 20g of carbs a day, but I won't throw a fit if I squeak in 30g), and the first two weeks were definitely rough, but I was happy I was seeing the scale go down for the first time in forever. My concern is that I'm not really getting hungry now. Like, I spent my entire day only being fueled by a 10 calorie electrolyte supplement and here I am at 8:30 at night trying to make myself eat and I'm STRUGGLING to want to eat. I'm not sure if it's adapting to keto that's making me lose my hunger and appetite, or if it's my former eating disorder brain taking control again. I don't see my doctor for another month, but I'd be interested to know if anyone else has dealt with a loft of appetite and if it eventually gets better?

I went on it strictly for weight loss, but along the way, I found myself really enjoying the ""side effects."" I felt more energized, more alert, had a decrease in appetite, and felt more empowered/determined. 

&amp;#x200B;

I stopped doing keto due to a surgery I had to get and my doctor recommended that I return to a ""regular"" diet while I recover. Truly, I miss doing keto. For most people, it can be a challenging regime to follow; there's definitely a lot of willpower, determination, and self control that goes into it, but it definitely made me proud of myself that I was following through. 

&amp;#x200B;

Many people know that keto is under a lot of scrutiny by the media a majority of the time. I saw this with my friends as well. When I started getting into keto and had to be more conscious of what I ate, I felt judged and unsupported. The common things they would say is what a lot of people hear: ""This doesn't seem sustainable at all."" ""You're not going to die if you have carbs."" ""This isn't healthy at all."" ""You're just going to end up gaining all the weight back once you finish anyway."" I would explain the positive changes I was seeing, but it would go in one ear and out the other. Sometimes, a part of me felt like it came from jealousy. My roommates, on the other hand, had no problem with my keto diet, and frankly didn't even care that I was on it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know people will say that they're not my real friends if they don't support me, but I don't like to fall under this line of thinking. They're great friends but I feel that people are more ""supportive"" of keto after they've done it. My parents were both keto for a year and my aunt has been keto for 4 years and they were super supportive of me. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is... What have been your experiences with judgment towards your regime, and how did you ignore/overcome it? What kept you motivated throughout, etc?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm about three weeks into keto and I'm just really grateful for not only the diet itself, but also the great information I've gleaned by lurking around this sub. 

&amp;#x200B;

Utilizing essentially a form of ""dirty"" keto and 16:8 IF, I've been able to break down my (almost nightly) acid reflux to 0 (one occurrence in the last three weeks), tone down my junk food cravings, and get to a point where I almost forget to eat during the day! And while I don't personally look all that much different, the scale informs me that I've dropped 16# since starting. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few observations:   
\-I don't know if it's the keto or the IF (or both) but they do something magical to my cravings. Very little (if any) junk/carb cravings 

\-I haven't broken my occasional need for an energy drink in the morning, but it's definitely lessened. And when I need one, I reach for a Red Bull Zero or a Rockstar Total Zero. 

\-Fallen in love with chicken thighs! Batch-cook them in the Instant Pot, shred them, and store them in the fridge for a cheese wrap, salad, or just heated in a bowl with Franks Red Hot! 

\-There's still an occasional sweet tooth calling me, and I've discovered the absolute best alternative: Atkins Peanut Butter cups. 3g net carbs and they're as delicious as Reeses! 

\-Cheese. Cheese, cheese, cheese.

In the last 2 years i've been eating a lot of junk food and got around \~118kg (195cm height - 22 yrs old) and now i want to go back to keto to regulate my weight and fix my lifestyle.

I did a blood test today to have a reference point before starting but the results are pushing me back a bit. I was reading  about cholesterol stuff but i didn't really found a clear answer for my situation.

So, my lipidic profile is the following:

**Lipids** 681 mg/dL  - optimal level between 400 - 700   
**VLDL** 35 mg/dL  - optimal level &lt; 30   
**TG** 176  mg/dL - optimal level &lt; 150, borderline 150-199, high &gt; 200  
**LDL** 124,7  mg/dL - optimal level &lt; 100, near normal limit 100-129, borderline 130-150, high &gt; 160  
**HDL-C** 36.2 mg/dL - low &lt; 40,ideal &gt;= 60  
**CHOL** 184.5 mg/dL - optimal &lt;200, borderline : 200-240, high &gt; 240  

This leads to a TG:HDL ratio of **almost 5** which is close to very bad from what i know. How close is this linked to junk food and how fast can you decrease it?  
Should I lower TG/increase HDL before starting keto? is this high because i'm kinda fat right now (**31 BMI**) and it will level down with time?  
Should i start keto at all at this point?

I would also consult a medic for bloodwork interpretation.

I had a very successful first 'attempt' at a Keto diet last Summer which I thoroughly enjoyed - losing almost 9.5 KG and 3.5% body fat in 3/4 months. Whilst the diet was sustainable, I felt great, healthy, energetic etc. I did quit for 3-4 months and following the birth of my daughter and an over-indulgent Christmas break I had put pretty much all of it back on, which I thought was fair enough.

I've tried again this year, with some success - 6.5KG and 3.2% body fat loss in the same period, but finding it harder work and less rewarding this time around - I think as the gains are slower than the previous period?

I'm copying below the 'data points' from both periods and I'd really greatly appreciate your feedback to help me get answers to my two main questions:

1. I've used so many different calculators it's difficult to know what kind of weight and body fat % loss I should be targeting (per week) and if my Macros are (or were) optimised. I got the feeling with attempt #1 I was potentially losing weight a little 'too quickly', but that also gave me the flexibility to have cheat days knowing it would not derail me for too long.
2. Should I be taking the logical approach and reverting to my previous Macros where I was getting results I was happy with? I am currently 85KG which is by no means heavy, but my body-fat is around 25% fat which I am desperate to reduce. I do very little exercise currently, due to a combination of COVID and new family life - if that makes any difference.

**Attempt #1 (Averages)**

FAT - 120G / 65%  
PROTEIN - 105G / 25%  
CARBS - 17G / 4%  
CAL - 1600

**Attempt #2 (Averages)**

FAT - 110G / 55%  
PROTEIN - 135G / 35%  
CARBS - 17G / 4%

I was around 193 then. I’ve started Keto twice before but gave up, both times I dropped 10 pounds in the first week. This time I was keeping up with my water WAY better however. This time I only dropped 4.4 pounds in the first week. Yesterday I woke up to discover I weighed a pound more than I did the morning before. I still weigh exactly that this morning. 185.8. So in these weeks I’ve essentially only dropped 2 pounds at most, since I will regain at least 5 pounds of water weight as soon as I go back to eating carbs. This diet is not going to be a lifetime change for me. I was just trying to drop some quick pounds before trying for another baby with the hubby.

I’ve been logging my daily food intake and have stayed well within my carb goals of less than 18g a day. Often I’m ending the day with 8 or more carbs remaining. I’ve also not gone over my other macros either. And have stayed within range of all of them. I’m definitely not eating too much and I don’t snack much as I hate virtually all sugar alternative snacks. My ketones tests all come back positive everyday.

Is this normal weight loss? Or should I just give up? Maybe Keto just cannot work for me. This is a very hard diet to stick to. I’ve no problems giving up snacks, as I’d already limited myself before I started keto, but no pasta or rice or bread is very hard. Still I could easily stick with it if it were actually doing any good but at this point I feel it’s not doing much of anything at all. Two pounds (maybe) in the first week is not worth it. I could eat healthier and force myself to actually excessive for that measly amount. Any thoughts, advice, especially from those keto veterans out there, would be great!

I was hoping to get some help about why I can't get my body to enter Ketosis.. .

For the last 4-5 weeks I've been attempting Keto, but can't get my weight to move (even a single KG). 

Biggest problem I've got, is I can't accurately macro track my meals, because I work remotely and eat at a cafateria (buffet) for all my meals. 

I've been using myfitnesspal to track my macros as best I can, this weeks macros (65% fat, 28% prot, 8% carbs) should be working for me. 

I ordered a few little additions to help, like ketofatbomb coffee creamer and keto cheesecake smoothies to help boost the fat, because I just can't get easy access to avacodos and coconut oil.

Look forward to ideas and thoughts on what's causing this, or what worked for you to kick start keto. 

Attached is the last 7 days of macros/calories.

When first start I was totally lost. I didn’t know what most of the letters and numbers above meant. After a while it became apparent. I made an account specifically for this subreddit. I had stalked it for about a month before giving it a try. The current goal weight is only my first goal. I will be setting new goals after reaching those. Making realistic goals for myself first. 

The first month I lost 16 pounds. I started at the beginning of February. I was absolutely shocked by how much better I felt within that first month. No more bloating, more mental clarity, overall I became less socially anxious and never as tired as I used to be! Not to mention the reduced appetite and overall confidence boost that it gave me determination. No more of my reckless binge eating. 

During March I hit a miniature stall. I lost another pound or so in the beginning of March. The scale wasn’t budging at all after that. It went on for about 3 weeks. Not enough to be called an official stall. It wasn’t until this last week that the scale started to budge again. Even though it only budged a pound it felt like a huge victory after it refusing not to budge for almost an entire month. I know, I know, the inches matter too. Although I don’t really have anything to measure inches. But during March I also noticed my endurance had increase as some of you might have seen from my recent NVS evil hill post. Even though I have only lost 4 pounds this month even the small victories add up. Who knows there is still 2 more days to go in March. But I am 4 pounds away from onederland! Been almost 2 years since I had last been in onederland.

If anyone needs a push to start or get back on well here it is. Small victories count and they sure do add up over time. Also on a little side note, has anyone else like when they look at high carb foods they used to love, they just don’t look as appetizing anymore?

I have been trying to lose weight for 2 decades and have never been successful despite my efforts, I have always exercised moderately. I have never been an over eater, dont even like fast food or junk but will over snack here and there but its never been a real problem as I never keep snacks in the house. I have always felt that I eat less than most people yet have always been heavier than most. Every attempt to lose weight has resulted in a measly 5lbs loss in 3 months or so then I lose heart and give up because the process is always painful for me, so then just go back to my old way of eating, even though my old way of eating ain't bad at all.

Anyway I started my keto journey mid Feb, weighed myself after 3 weeks of carefully logging my food intake with 20 grams of carbs. Miserable most if the time and wondering if I am just wasting my time like before and . Then I stepped on the scale and had barely lost anything, maybe 1lb, despite all the science saying its in those first few weeks that you lose rapidly, never seems to happen for me on any diet. I cried to realize I hadn't lost anything despite eating keto for 3 weeks. And I am eating the right way I know, I eat enough fat and protein to not be hungry but I miss regular good so much. 

So I will not weigh myself for a couple more months. I dont feel or look like I have lost any weight and its been 1.5 months, even fasted two whole days. Cheat days = 3.

But I feel so hopeless
1. Anyone out there who felt like their initial weight loss didn't even really happen like it does for everyone else?
2. How do you stay the course when you feel so discouraged,  when you think despite your efforts nothing will ever work for you and you see no light at the end of the tunnel.
3. I have heard a lot of people say there have been on keto for years. Wondering at what point you were fully happy with the keto lifestyle, no longer miserable with what you had to eat and did not even miss carbs anymore? When will I get to this point too?

I feel so hopeless, and kind of miserable because I miss the carbs. Everyday is a struggle even though I have kept at it for 1.5 months.

\-Most days, I do about an hour to an hour 15 min of cardio on an empty stomach. It's not super strenuous, but I've mixed up doing walking and HIIT some days, and just walking and elliptical on others. I don't believe i'm over exercising. 

\-I ordered a Keto Mojo about 3 weeks ago and my fasting glucose is in the 70-80 range. My ketone level is consistently under 1. One or two days it went up to 1.5 but I mostly stay at 0.5 to 0.8. 

\-I did one meal a day for about 2 weeks, making sure my one meal was rich in good fats. I'd drink coffee, eat 3 farm fresh eggs, keto toast with 4 net grams carbs, and i would make an avocado spread. And of course, MCT oil. I reduced my cheese intake and nut intake. I do not eat keto snacks. 

\-Since I haven't been losing, I've looked into whether a few of the foods (like for example, the keto bread) are causing my blood sugar to rise. I've tested this using my KetoMojo to test my BG and ketones 30 min, 1 hour, and 3 hours after I eat. No problem with the foods! None of the ones I suspected increased my blood sugar more than 25 units at 30 min, and I returned to baseline by 3 hours. 

\-Yes, I get good sleep.

\-No, I don't think i'm that stressed out at all. 

Any help would be very much appreciated. Why am I not losing like before? Should I do fasting? One meal a day? I do that then read that the reason I'm not losing is because my calorie count is too low!

Depois de dar à luz nosso filho em julho passado, eu sabia que precisava perder peso. Mas eu estava com medo. Eu havia tentado e falhado tantas vezes que simplesmente não conseguia passar pela ansiedade, impaciência, autocrítica, desespero e derrota mais uma vez. Portanto, decidi esperar até que estivesse emocionalmente pronto para perder peso. (Graças a esta submissão, eu já estava mentalmente preparado e sabia o que precisava fazer quando estivesse pronto para me comprometer.)

Para mim, prontidão emocional significava aprender a ser grato pelo meu corpo. Tinha carregado dois bebês lindos (um que pesava 4,5 kg ao nascer) e era forte apesar de anos de estresse e alimentação estressante. Também tive que parar de ver minha dieta como um castigo por engordar e, em vez disso, começar a ver a perda de peso como um presente que eu queria dar ao meu corpo por tudo que ele fez por mim. E, finalmente, eu tive que deixar de acreditar que eu tinha que fazer Keto perfeitamente, e se eu não o fizesse, eu estava condenado ao fracasso e acabaria desistindo. De novo.

Quando reiniciei o Keto em 9 de fevereiro, me pesei, mas não tirei nenhuma foto. Eu não rastreei minhas macros ou registrei minha comida porque rastrear essas coisas sempre me fez questionar se eu estava “otimizando” meus esforços. Eu simplesmente comia alimentos com pouco ou nenhum carboidrato (principalmente carne, queijo, ovos, manteiga) e vegetais. Tirei uma foto “antes” alguns dias depois, mas apenas de frente e de trás. E então, algumas semanas depois disso, tirei algumas fotos depois de ver alguém neste grupo dizer como isso foi útil para ela.

I'm fairly new to this sub and I have a couple of questions that you all lovely people might be able to help with. 

&amp;#x200B;

My husband and I started our keto journey in February. Since then I've lost a total of 14 lbs (Started at 289 lbs sitting at 275 lbs) which is an ACHIEVEMENT all in itself since I'm on a corticosteroid called prednisone for my asthma. Before keto, the hubs and I used to enjoy making yogurt in our instant pot because it was cheaper for us to make our morning breakfasts than buy premade. Since we've started we've been having a hard time finding a good yogurt that is 1. tasty and 2. still keto-friendly. We found some Kroger carb master ones that are pretty good and seem to fall within the carb intake we want but I want to attempt making it ourselves again but I'm at a loss at how to make yogurt at home that's still ok! Does anyone have any experience with this? 

&amp;#x200B;

Second question: Every year we get a ham for Easter and usually after stuffing our faces with delicious delicious ham, we save the ham hock so my hubby can make his fantastic ham hock soup. However this year since we're on the keto train, we're not sure how to make a tasty ham hock soup with no beans in it (his recipe calls for navy beans). Anyone have any good recipes they're willing to share with some newbies?

So a few weeks back I posted here, I was getting anxious about cholesterol and a family history of heart disease. I just kept going, mostly because it just made sense for my body (never - ever have I felt this happy before while doing a major change on my diet, and I followed most of the advice people gave me here). I am a 37 (F), mother of 2, and I still have some weight to lose. These last few weeks I switched yoga for belly dance, 3-4 days a week, kept eating fat, proteins, some vegetables (a bit of zucchini here and there, and cauliflower) and green leaves (spinach, lettuce, etc). 

So everything's going great, but I wanted to ask some of the women here, I've read many posts about Keto worsening your PMS, but my experience was the absolute opposite. I've been eating Keto for almost a month now, and I've always suffered before my period, really bad PMS, horrible migraines, a cyst in my right ovary that sometimes caused excruciating pain (having to go to the ER on some occasions), cramps, loose stools, vomiting, joint pain and binge eating. This month was nothing like that, smooth as silk. I didn't have any cravings (though I ate cocoa nibs before and dark chocolate with no sugar), I did indulge in hot cocoa with a bit of cream and some drops of stevia (don't really use sweeteners at all, but this time I did), and on my first day I'm feeling surprisingly better than I have felt in years. A side effect though, is that a week after I started eating Keto my libido went up, high as hell, like a teenager. I've been looking for an explanation but I still can't quite get it. Is it the estrogens because of the meat I'm eating? Have I always been healthier and hornier and I just got stuck on an awful lifestyle for most of my life? 

It feels crazy, I'm not even counting calories, I just stay Keto as naturally as I can, keeping it very simple, and I know I've lost weight (my balance is broken so idk how much I've lost), but I don't think just losing weight can make me this horny, or feeling so good about myself. Or work on my cyst and my ovaries, and PMS... It feels so amazing. 6 months ago my then boyfriend told me he didn't love me anymore, I don't even know what I was thinking being with him, it was the worse relationship of my life, and as I look back now I feel so different from that overweight, overtired and turned off woman that I was then... 

I'm just so amazed by this return to health, so to speak... I've been approached by other men, I feel is something that it is also starting to show in the outside, so it's not just a feeling apparently. I had sex with a guy I used to date, but my libido still can't get enough (what's wrong with me? 🤣). I can't say that I'm feeling like running a marathon now that I'm on my period, it still hurts a bit, and I still use a warm bottle, but I'm not crying in pain or feeling indisposed. Still feel horny though, that makes me really curious. 

So, have any of you girls / women have noticed this kind of hormonal changes?

Later that day, as I was munching on the pork rinds and nearing the end of the bag, I noticed the crumbs at the bottom had a distinctly sweet taste. Hm. Weird. The bag said ""zero carb"", but I know the taste of sugar when it hits my taste buds. 

So I flip the bag over and check the nutritional info: it indeed lists the carb count as ""0"". 

*Okay... Let's take a look at the ingredients then*... And there we have it: listed as the second ingredient is ""coconut palm sugar""... 😕

Is this a huge deal? Well, it could be for some people, depending on their daily allotment of total carb intake. But it might be just fine for others. 

My whole point is just to be mindful of what's really in those products we consider ""safe"" or keto-friendly. Be aware that even though the front of a package claims the item is ""zero carb"", there still might be undesirable ingredients in the product.

But I was afraid to. I had tried and failed so many times, I simply did not have it in me to go through the anxiety, impatience, self-criticism, hopelessness, and defeat once again. So I decided I would wait until I was emotionally ready to lose weight. (Thanks to this sub, I was already mentally prepared and knew what I needed to do once I was ready to commit.)

For me, emotional readiness meant learning to be grateful for my body. It had carried two beautiful babies (one who weighed 10.13 lbs at birth), and was strong despite years of stress and stress eating. I also had to stop seeing my diet as a punishment for getting fat and instead start seeing weight loss as a gift that I wanted to give my body for everything it has done for me. And finally, I had to let go of the belief that I had to do Keto perfectly, and that if I didn’t, I was doomed to failure and would just wind up quitting. Again. 

When I restarted Keto on February 9, I weighed myself but I did not take any pictures. I did not track my macros or log my food because tracking these things has always caused me to question whether I was “optimizing” my efforts. I simply ate low carb to no carb food (mostly meat, cheese, eggs, butter) and veggies. I took a “before” picture a few days later, but only from the front and back. And then a few weeks after that, I took some side pictures after seeing someone in this group say how helpful it was to her. 

I am now 7 weeks in. I still don’t track anything, although I weigh myself every few days because the numbers no longer cause analysis paralysis. I’ve lost 20 pounds and still have another 40 pounds to go before I will be at a comfortable, healthy BMI. I would like to try IF at some point, but I’m letting myself settle into this new normal for a little while longer. 

And even though the judgmental voice inside my head is telling me not to post this, I let fear and shame tell me how to feel about my body for decades. Also, I have learned so much from this sub and have been inspired by so many people here, I thought I would share my story for anyone else who may be afraid to try again.

A couple weeks ago I posted asking for help because I cook for my family and I wasn’t sure if keto would be feasible cooking for both myself and my family. You can see my last post here: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/m0enfy/how_the_hell_am_i_supposed_to_eat_keto_with_a_non/

I knew I desperately needed to lost weight, but didn’t realize how much until I took progress pics and saw the amount of back fat I have. 

I decided to do keto the week my siblings would not be with me to have a head start. It was difficult at first, but I eventually got the hang of things. I should add that this is not my first round of keto. I tried it a couple years ago and I did lose weight but I didn’t stick with it.

A true test of this diet would come this past Monday when my siblings came to stay with me for the week. The food that we usually eat is filled with carbs from rice sugar, bread, etc. we mainly eat Caribbean foods which are filled with carbs.

I am writing this to encourage anyone in A situation like mine. IT IS POSSIBLE TO EAT KETO AND COOK FOR YOUR FAMILY AT THE SAME TIME. Yeah, it takes more work, but it’s worth it. You also have to be creative. 

Here’s what a couple meals this week looked like: 

Monday: Jerk Salmon, Asparagus, and baked potato (ditch the potato) 

Wednesday: Chicken Kabobs, yogurt sauce, broccoli, and yellow rice (replace yellow rice with yellow califlower rice) 

Friday: Chipotle 

Saturday: Homemade Burgers, fries, ice cream, chips (no bun burger, ditch the fries, rebel ice cream, and Quest chips) 

Sunday: Red beans and rice, stew chicken, baked Mac and cheese, carrot cake (okay so I didn’t have ANY of this. Can’t even have stew chicken because the base of it is caramelized sugar. I had a protein shake instead. I was planning to have a Cobb salad but got too sidetracked to prepare it. ) 

On Sunday for breakfast I had bacon and eggs in a low carb tortilla and coffee which kept me full the WHOLE day and I only had a protein shake at 1 am before I went to sleep because I was feeling peckish. It’s unbelievable how full this diet keeps you. 

Side note: does anyone know of a sugar alcohol that caramelizes the same as sugar?? 

GUYS!!!!! I didn’t not cheat. NOT ONCE. Not with the rice, bread, carrot cake, ice cream, Doritos, aloo (potato) pie, pancakes, English muffins, Mac and cheese. And this is coming from someone with binge eating disorder. 

I wanted piece of carrot cake so bad (I like to bake) but I stayed strong. I saw some carrot cake fat bombs I’d like to try, tho.

I've heard friends and people on here say that the reason that they think they start to stall on keto is because of them eating keto deserts. I thought the same too. We were keeping it under 20 carbs everyday, so what was wrong? Then I tried something that I was avoiding. I started loosing weight immediately.

Were you still eating your greens? 

I found out that for me personally, it wasn't so much of the ""rebel ice-cream and general keto stuff everyday"" that was messing up my progress, I learned that as soon as I added green veggies into my diet everyday, I started losing weight again. Immediately. But I still eat the ice-cream, atkins, and everything keto related like that. I do this pretty much everyday. Like, now I eat 2-3 small bags of those quest chips (4 net carbs each (I know, but they are SO good)), two peanut butter cups (2 net carbs), two cheesy hot dogs wrapped in keto bread or one split keto tortilla (2 for bread or 5 carbs for tortilla), and a full can of green beans with butter and salt and pepper (I dont generally count these carbs, especially if I'm under 20 by that point). I lose a .8 to a pound every 2 days. I'll also switch the deserts out with whatever I have at the time, like pecan ice-cream (ugh, yes)

I now keep my carbs pretty loose. If I go over 20, its usually just 23, and the rest is filled with the green beans (7).

Idk if this will work for everyone (because you might already be incorporating greens everyday, and there might be another seemingly inexplicable reason why your stalling)- but I do hope that this will reach another me out there who thinks that eating meat and cheese and everything else just to avoid greens is the move- because it isn't.

I use olive oil/coconut oil to cook everything so I know I'm getting more with that but don't know how much to calculate I'm actually eating, some gets burnt off while cooking and when I portion out my food and refrigerate then eat the meals it's not like the oils are always distributed well or even all eaten. I would just add stuff like cheese and Greek yogurt etc to finish off my macros but I want to figure out the oils number first to try and make sure I'm still at my defecit.

I'm M46, having struggled for the vast majority of my life with my weight, going up to 330lbs at my peak in my late 20s, yo yo-ing up and down, stabilizing at about \~275 for a few years until I decided about 15 years ago to go through bariatric surgery and get a lap band. That helped me out for a while, bringing my weight down to about 225, but I was building a ton of muscle at that point, going to the gym 5 days a week for a mix of light cardio and strength. And then, of course, ""life got in the way"". I work in tech, which meant long hours, grabbing whatever I could eat, and things crept up.

Over the last 20 years, I've also been suffering from mild clinical depression. Nothing crazy, but enough to add to the ""uggggggghh"" aspect of life and exercise, and coming up with excuses not to do X, Y, or Z. Unsurprisingly, things were a lot better during my ""healthy"" period, and my psychiatrist has often recommended focusing on my weight loss to get better. Easier said than done, especially when living in my head!

The challenge for me has been trust, and accountability. I'm married, with 2 kids, and am the cook of the house. My wife has known me forever (40+ years), and has seen me through all of my phases. I love her to death, and I know she means well, but she can be very judgmental, and over the years, I've lost my ability to have a proper discussion around anything regarding my health, or weight. I just get incredibly defensive, and change the subject.

I've also tried, and somewhat successfully lost a decent chunk of weight. A few years back, I got into golfing (after years of making fun of my parents), and started WW at the time and dropped a good 25lbs in a few weeks. But I would do all of this avoiding conversations with the family, or even mentioning I was doing it. Given I'm the cook in the house, it didn't lead to good, sustaining results. This accountability problem didn't just lie with how I interacted with my family, heck, my feeling of repeated failure kept pushing me to delay visits to doctors for checkups, and given my family has a long history of diabetes, and some heart disease, it was incredibly irresponsible. I'm a walking heart attack waiting to happen. I'd always push my reminders out a few months until ""I'd lose enough weight to have some good news to give my dr as she gave me the look of disappointment."".

A few months back, I realized that a year of quarantine killed what little exercise I was getting at work, and my days consisted of 10 hours on my desk chair, a few hours with the family, and then a few hours watching TV or back to work. My sleeping patterns were messed up because I'd choose to fall asleep on the couch, setting my alarm for \~5am to then go up to bed, so my wife could get a really good night sleep without me snoring next to her (no sleep apnea, but boy, I can be a trumpet). My back is shot, I can barely walk straight, and am in constant pain. I'm an 80 year old man in a 40something body. The thought of the pandemic being over and the world going back to ""normal"" is both exciting, but also agonizing. No more excuses to do absolutely nothing.

While my depression has always been fairly mild, I've lost family members to suicide, and would never ever every think of inflicting something like that on my own family and friends. But hey, if I died from a heart attack, would that be so bad? I felt like I hit rock bottom. 

I know it sounds dumb, but it took all my courage to sit down with my wife and tell her that it was time, I was seeking help, and that while I knew she meant well, I needed her to give me some room here. I'd tried keto a few times for short periods of time, and it suits me well in general as I'm not really a carbs person anyhow (but doing it in hiding is incredibly difficult...). I decided to bite the bullet, and sign up to Virta Health, buy a peloton, and say screw it - I'll be the guy who comes in 100 thousandth on leaderboards for a while, but I know I'll be better. Two things that work with me: accountability and gamification. Virta holds me accountable. No hiding, the coach is on you daily, everything's measured. It forced me to go to the dr and get results (and I'm just incredibly lucky that despite all the abuse my body has taken, my blood sugars and cholesterol numbers are high, but below any problematic numbers... Peloton, once I get started, gamifies things. I started on Duolingo learning Japanese a couple of years back for the fun of it, and not only kept going regardless of what was going on, but made me decide to take formal lessons and go to Japan. All that because of that damn streak :)

I know all of this is irrelevant to all of you, but honestly, /r/keto has been an inspiration for the last few years, and seeing all of your stories was really the inspiration to get started. This is just the beginning, but I wanted to say thank you for nudging me to get on the bandwagon that I'm sure I'll fall off of, but get back on again. I owe it to myself, and my amazing family.

I had had problems having healthcare prior to now, and was able to get it in January, after not having it for a long time, but I suspected that was the case for some time now.

After 5 weeks, I went back for a follow-up.  My A1C1 is down 2 entire points in only 5 weeks, with keto (15 lbs weight loss) and metformin.  It's almost at normal range, and is *currently* normal, based on my blood glucose tests.  The A1C1 will assuredly go down some more in a couple months after the metformin and keto have been doing their stuff in synergy.  My doctor was impressed.  I have never seen a doctor be so perky and delighted!  He told me to keep up the good work, and complimented me three or four times.  I wasn't even sure how to take that much praise lol.  He also said he thought I could reverse my diabetes, get off of the metformin, and should strive for that.  Lucky break there, getting the doctor who knows this is possible, and doesn't just treat it like it's a done deal!

After I had my daughter in August 2019 I thought the baby weight would fall off as soon as I went back to work (Registered Nurse, on feet all day). Boy, was I better.

I spent the first few months battling PPD and post partum hypertension.

I went back to work carry most of my pregnancy weight. Cue the start of the pandemic last May. I sent my daughter to live with my dad who has multiple ailments because my husband and I are both nurses- him in a hospital and I in long term care. My father normally babysits my daughter a few days a week for us and getting her every day would put him at risk.

I was the most depressed I had ever been at that point. I missed my 6 month old more than anything but the pandemic was new and we were all afraid. I missed her first Easter and nearly milestones for the month she was with my dad. I couldn't take it. I gorged.

Taking her back a month later was terrifying but thankfully we all stayed healthy at the time (I recently had covid- mild for me at least. Other family members did not fair as well). It was then I realized I needed to do better for myself and for her.

I stayed the same weight the past couple weeks without any significant change to exercise or diet.  They say weightloss is nonlinear.  It becomes amplified as you get closer to goal.

I am even excited... EXCITED, for my annual physical checkup next week.  I never thought I would say that.  Before I put off annual checkups because I loathed the inevitable lecture about how I should try to lose some weight.  Almost ashamed at what I had done to my body...Not anymore!!

My runners knee pain has been on and off but the weather finally broke and I have been biking a few times a week.  I also picked up some resistance bands to work on building up muscles that don't get used very much running.  My knee has already started feeling better by focusing on low impact exercise.

I bumped up my macros closer to maintenance last week and wow. It's a ton of food.  I'll be bumping all the way up to maintenance tomorrow.  Then somehow figure out an accurate way to account for exercise calories.  I rarely ate into them during my initial weight loss period.  I will probably just eat half of what fitbit says the exercise was and adjust as required.  Seems to be a popular method.

Thank you again to everyone that takes the time to share their knowledge, trials, and inspiration on this sub.  It helped me (and my wife) a lot!

After an emotionally draining week of family drama and funeral events...its hitting me hard. I haven’t fell off my diet or really felt like cheating...but mentally I’m running low. Self-esteem and motivation are in the gutter and I’m feeling super self-critical. Hormones are a trip. I decided to make a list of NSV’s to stay positive and keep this this keto train going. 

1. Out of all the causes of stress earlier this week, getting dressed was NOT one of them! Getting dressed up fancier than normal is usually dreadful and just uncomfortable, especially if I’m wearing a dress. This time...it wasn’t even a thought. Everything just fit and fit well. Brought the stress level down a ton. 

2. M/L size stockings no longer make me feel like suffocating. They don’t make me look like a stuffed sausage or leave a horrible red itchy mark on my stomach for hours after taking them off. Tbh, this may have been because I could never admit my size😅. They seem to be not catching runs either because of the lesser amount of stretch. Woo! 

3. Regular width flats no longer give me sharp pains on my feet. I never wear certain shoes because I have bad feet/bunions. Particular styles (like flats) I have to go for the wide choice and even then I never buy them. Holy moly! I’m still the same size 8 but now I can wear this regular width shoe with little problem?? I bought these sleek, kind of narrow looking flats. Who am I? My feet shrank! 

4. I’m no longer sweating (even with a mask) when I do a simple task like going to take the dogs out and chatting with neighbors. This one really bothered me before and it was soo awkward. Something about the mix of being overweight, overheating, and being self conscious would make me sweat (my face in particular) as soon as I leave my home or have to converse with someone. I would literally cut conversation short to run off. If it’s a makeup day, double whammy. I used to chalk this up to anxiety. Welp, no. I was just fat. Now I’m easy breezy lemon squeezey! Hell, I even get cold sometimes. 

5. I’m finding it much easier to track my monthly cycle and symptoms on keto. When I ate all the carbs and whatever I wanted, it was always so difficult to know where pain, inflammation, stomach aches, etc was coming from. Bloated and feel like shit, well is it the whole pizza I ate last night or is ovulation early? Short tempered with a headache, is it the crash from the sugary danishes or is shark week coming? These questions are so simplified for me now because my diet is on point and I know how keto makes me feel, so it’s easier to track outside symptoms. As a woman, this makes me feel really good knowing my body. 

When you’re feeling low and life is kicking you in the behind...remember you’re making changes and doing the damn thing. 5 pounds or 50. It doesn’t matter. Every small victory counts. Please comment if you can think of any or just want to get something off your chest 😊🙏🏼. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk, girls and boys. 21 lbs down and 19 lbs to go. KCKO!

I'm starting to realize that isn't the case. If I'm trying to lose weight, I need to also limit my fat intake and do workouts. I appreciate this, and I'll try to adjust myself accordingly. Which means I can't just eat a pound of bacon with my eggs every morning, I suppose.

My problem is really that I'm used to just eating whenever I want and I'm trying to limit myself, but is there any thing out there I can just eat to satisfy the desire to eat?

I started Keto on 26th of February and it’s been a really learning process for me. I was quite happy because I lost 7 kg (15.43 lbs) in such a short time. But recently I notice that my weight is always the same bouncing between 100g less or more and I’m feeling really unmotivated. I am tracking my macros with Carb Manager and I’m eating 20 carbs, 100 fats and 80 protein and I always manage to hit my goals. I also walk everyday between (4-5km) plus I work as a shop assistant and I’m all around always walking everywhere. 

You probably see so many posts about stalling but this is something new for me and when I feel unmotivated and sad I always feel like I’m stuck in a situation that I want to fix but I don’t know how. Maybe I just need some words of encouragement or maybe you guys know some way I can improve.

I am really struggling with the NHS half of the nursing staff I came in to contact with does not believe in bmi nor do my gp and most of the medical staff at my local practice despite being 140lbs at 5'1.





My symptoms are always worse when I am overweight, i was told to never ever again attempt a low carb diet.




I was never told why this happened to me despite even one of the nurses on the ward being on keto at the time I was staying there.





It was literally put down to a mystery and I was blamed, they say I was crash dieting and that I had anorexic tendencies.
I have always struggled with eating too much not too little.





I wondered it anyone else has suffered a near death experience with keto? 
I was supplementing with no salt, magnesium and potassium, yet it still led to a slow decline :/

A few years back, my fiancé and I decided to diet and start going hard at the gym. We went for an hour a day, 5 days a week as well as limited calories.

I was cautious about stating keto, but felt like I may as well try. I have now officially passed that weight block from a few years back and made it to 142lbs.

(I added the kids and husband to give you an idea of my daily life...not a single mom but it can feel like I am) Successfully did keto almost 2 years ago, lost 30 lbs, felt amazing. Got pregnant with the 3rd (yay!) but gained it all back and then some. I now work from home which has its pros and cons. I am having a *really* hard time going back to keto and sticking with it. A few reasons: 1) I’m so damn tired most of the time, struggling with off and on sleep issues with the baby 2) in a food rut? Nothing sounds good, ever so I tend to just eat easy crap 3) my husband’s off days are triggers cause he will go to the store and buy food that’s tempting/we finally all get to be together and relax which also leads to more relaxed eating 4) I’m an emotional eater so if I get an emotional trigger, it’s SO hard to fight 5) meal planning for my family and then myself separately is exhausting, I despise it, so I usually count myself out and just get what the rest of the family needs (I’m aware that I need to take care of myself but it doubles my “work” in preparing for the week so I just short change my own stuff)

We just invested in a home gym setup so I now get to do strength training when I can fit it in which is usually my lunch breaks. Having the flexibility to work it into my schedule is amazing. I know keto is the best option for my way of eating. I honestly think I have a carb intolerance, even incorporating a little here and there works against me. I have literally been fighting between 203-200 lbs for months and months. The lowest I’ve gotten is 197 and that lasted a day. Vacillating between these 3 lbs is making me inSANE and just want to sCrEaM. I already have my food logged for tomorrow, ready to start and having a plan helps, of course. 

And if I’m being honest, this not being *new* is working against me. The first time I did keto it was NEW and exciting and it was awesome. Now it’s like, oh ok, I know what I need to do but it’s not *exciting*. Does that make sense at all?? I would love to hear from anyone and everyone.

This is a very low carb wrap made from eggs and cauliflower. It is very thin and tears easily. You will probably want to use two at a time. It's spongy and has almost no taste. According to the package it has 0 TOTAL carbs.

These are large oversized pieces of Mozarella Cheese. They also claim to have 0 TOTAL carbs.

These are oversized pieces of cheddar cheese.  Taste is mild, and they have a tendency to rip if you overstuff them. 1 g of TOTAL carbs.

I have Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. For over 20 years now. It’s been very stable for the last 10. I’ve lost 30+ pounds on keto. Lately tho, I was getting really hungry, and losing my control. Also struggling with horrible insomnia, which made me of course, completely exhausted during the day. I was thinking it was perimenopause symptoms. 

Then my hands started shaking. I knew right away. Went and got lab work done, and sure enough I’m hyper. That means I’m getting too much thyroid hormone. This can cause insomnia, heart racing, hand shaking, increased appetite....lots of fun things...sometimes it takes me a hot minute to figure out that it is a thyroid hormone fluctuation. Especially now, because it’s been so stable for so long. 

Once before I lost weight, 100 pounds, on WW, and my levels went up. A lot! Which seems counter intuitive. You would think, lost weight, lower blood volume, you would need LESS hormone. Nope, needed more. 🤷‍♀️ but sometimes this stupid disease is annoying like that. But this time I wonder about the GF aspect of this diet. I had a friend who was diagnosed, went GF, and never had to go on meds. Citing the inflammatory nature of gluten.

Hi everyone, I'm just 5 weeks into my keto journey, and swapped to my new macros just a few days ago so hopefully the weightloss improves - I'm still very happy with 14lbs though! I'm taking that as 10lbs water weight for the first week, and then about 1lb per week thereafter which is right on target. 

But weightloss aside, I wanted to share how keto has positively affected me, to try and encourage others to stick it out, even if their weightloss journey has been a bit of a bumpy ride. 

Joint pain - As a young person, experiencing chronic severe joint pain in my fingers and moderate pain in one of my knees for the past few years was painful and frustrating. Before lockdown I went to trapeze and pole fitness classes twice a week, but falls on any of these areas would result in pain that would take weeks to subside. I was told my symptoms were typical of rheumatoid arthritis, but I'd have to go in for further tests to confirm this. Since swapping to keto, my finger pain has disappeared entirely, and my knee pain is barely there. I really believe in this diet for reducing inflammation.

Spots / acne - In that same vein, the skin on my face has never been better. Whilst I only had mild acne on my cheeks, the overall quality of my skin was poor with it being bumpy, uneven, and red in places. The redness and spots have gone, and I cannot believe that the uneven texture I had, especially in places like my forehead where it's impossible to miss, has disappeared. 

Fat and water deposits - The first major change I experienced when I lost the initial water weight was the change in skin quality of my thighs. I use to sit on the toilet and look down at my thighs and hate their appearance; not quite cellulite, but lumpy all the same. The skin there has now evened out and the lumps are gone. I wonder if this is where water was being retained unevenly in places between the skin and fat?  

Bloating - Before keto I was frequently bloated and had stomach pains due to 1) the food I was eating, and 2) a bad habit I had of swallowing air when I was hungry. Despite still drinking the likes of Coke Zero, I haven't experience any bloating or pain whilst on keto, and my better, more fulfilling meals are helping with my air swallowing habit. 

Energy levels - I use to suffer from the post lunch slump and, as I'm currently working from home, would have to take a 2hr nap in the afternoon before returning to work. When I was working in the office, this would of course be impossible so my productivity would just cease to exist and I'd be sat at my desk managing to do next to no work. Happy to say that I've shockingly not had a single nap since starting keto. I'm able to go the entire day with my levels of productivity being pretty consistent throughout. 

Brain fog - Likewise, my brain fog has gone. I struggled focussing on tasks, and was frequently overwhelmed by large amounts of data (I create simulations for the oil and gas industry, so handle a lot of numbers). I feel like my mind is sharper now and I'm less likely to have my eyes ""glaze"" over. 

Mood - I suffer from stress and anxiety. Whether it's just down to making a positive impact in my life, or whether it's the diet itself, I can't remember the last time I felt this good. I feel happy, optimistic and like a metaphorical weight has been lifted from me, even before the phsyical weight has gone. For the first time in 7 years, I'm starting to feel like I'm getting myself back. 

Sleep - No more struggling to sleep. I'm getting a good, undisturbed night of sleep each night, and have gone from being that person who hits the snooze button on their alarm clock a million times, to waking up before my alarm. 

Relationship with food - I hated food. I was a high carb snack eater because I hated preparing meals. Now I actually enjoy the process of researching what I'm going to make, getting creative with recipes, and then getting hands on with making it. Keto's restrictions remove some of the overwhelming choice there is with food, and working within those confines actually makes it easier to come up with interesting dishes. 

Hopefully some of my experience can act as motivation for others, so thanks for letting me share ☺️",True,False,False,keto,t5_2rske,2348160,public,self,My Keto Journey | How my quality of life has improved after just 5 weeks,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/mf0p5j/my_keto_journey_how_my_quality_of_life_has/,all_ads,6,success,a8bb6b80-abe7-11e8-8696-0ed9e0d77ef8,Success Story,,,,,,,,,,,

I hope you are all doing great in these crazy times. 

I’m relatively new to the keto experience. I started on the 15th March and have been relatively consistent in maintaining 2000 cals, 150p 170f &lt;20n.c. across 4 meals a day.

So far I have lost 4.6kg (10lbs). I have had a few off-days where a pizza and cookie dough attacked me and I had to eat them. But 6/7 I’m keto and really enjoying it. Any tips to beat the darn sweet tooth?

I’m trying the 90% dark chocolate but it just makes me want to go smash a family of 8 size baked cookie dough or whole Colin the Caterpillar birthday cake. No Jokes 😭😭😭

I know this question is asked a fair amount. But is 10lbs a lot to loose in 3 weeks? Mainly because I’m not trying to massively undercut my cals because I want to loose it slowly with training and toning (usually burn 300-400 cals W/ exercise, 4 days a week). Plus I’m 89kg at 6ft and pretty broad anyway. 

Lastly... on the topic of protein, I have been aiming for 140g of protein but I do tend to overshoot that as I love the meat. Will an extra  40-50g throughout the day push me out of ketosis?

I love Keto.  But doing it well took a chunk of time that simply is not available to me at this point.

I take 2 classes in the Spring, Summer and Fall terms and 1 class in the winter term (it is only 4 weeks long - talk about intense!!!!).

I have a great arrangement with my boss where I am allowed to use company resourses for studying.  I work six days a week.  I do my work and when I punch out, I can just pick right up with doing homework and any online stuff that needs to occur.  On work days, I get there around 8 a.m., work, punch out, study and then go home.  The drawback...getting home is usually about 10 p.m.  Sundays, while a day off, I usually go into the office again and spend about 10-12 hours studying and doing homework. 

Time is at a premium for me.  I used to do meal preps in the evenings and on Sundays (I make an awesome homemade beef jerky - do I ever miss that...), but right now that just does not occur consistantly.  I am hoping to receive ideas and suggestions about meals that people have found that can be made quickly.  Or ideas you have seen that work in busy scenarios.  

I am sure someone will suggest doing my studying at home to accomplish both.  I tried that my first semester.  Home offers too many distractions and ways to NOT spend the time I need to studying.  I should also note that I was diagnosed with ADHD about half way through my first semester after I started school again.  Even with medication, those distractions available at home grab my attention way too easily. 

The arrangement with my boss to study and do homework at work has been a god send for being able to focus on school.  Work is literally for WORK.  Paid WORK and then home-WORK. It just does not lend itself to spending any significant time on doing Keto as well as I used to.  

I would love to hear success others have had in busy situations.  Quick recipes appreciated!!!

Long time listener, first time caller, here.  

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm a semi-nocturnal kind of character (down at 4am, up at 11am), and it's common due to my schedule (and the fact that we all live in a diurnal world) that occasionally, and for a number of reasons, my schedule will ""flip"" or be irregular for several days or I'll fall into a 36-hour schedule. It happens, it's totally a part of both my schedule and my profession. My real question is this:

&amp;#x200B;

So let's just say for whatever reason, I'm awake for 24 hours. When counting calories and macros for keto, do I count my waking time, or the actual time?

&amp;#x200B;

Meaning, is sleep kind of a ""reset"" that restarts when I should start tracking for the next day? Or should I be treating each day as a separate day for tracking calories and macros regardless of whether I've slept or not? Both seem like they'd make sense: being awake longer probably means you need more calories, right?

&amp;#x200B;

For example:

&amp;#x200B;

I eat 2,056 calories a day and I'm awake for 36 hours, then sleep for 12. Should I only be eating my 2,056 calories, or should I be eating two days worth of calories? Or even 1.5x my normal caloric intake?

Then I just swallow some butter or olive oil or whatever healthy fats, correct? 

1 tablespoon = 12.7817005 grams.

Hence, 49/12.8 = approximately 4 tablespoons.

Correct?

Also another question, since the entire chicken yields 326g of protein and my macro allows me daily of 104g, is there any/too much negatives from eating too much protein?

I managed to steady my weight loss by eating more on days when I was most active (I have an active job which burns a lot of calories, I ended up having to snack on foods to try and keep my calories up). 

It's been just over a week and I feel so much better. No chocolate, crisps, burgers, chips, cheesy mash, pizza, ice cream, sugary, energy or alcohilic drinks- the things I eat/drink most. I've been having so much salad and veg and meat, always meal prepping, I even started to cook! Before I would just grab what was there because it was convenient whilst I was hungry. I'm even starting to get hungry less, and just snack on seeds and nuts and these low carb cracker type things with peanut butter or cheesy spread. This, I know, will do me a world of good, health-wise.

My only issue is I don't think I'm meeting my calorie goals for the amount I burn when working, and I work a lot. A lot of it is probably water weight, but I've lost 6.5 pounds in a week.

I have been on keto for around 3-4 years and haven't had a blood test in around 4 years. I am 24 years old, lightly active, and have been eating a standard keto diet (meat, greens, dairy, some fruit, some keto sweetners, some nuts, etc.) up until Feb, 1st, where I tried a more keto-carnivoreish style diet (more red meat, eggs, sardines,fish, some greens, etc.) more specifically, in the past 45 days and lost around 5 more pounds (170 to 165). FYI I do not drink coffee, and I eat during a 4 hour window every day with 1 large meal around 6:00 (example: 3 1 pound grass-fed burgers with 2 eggs over easy, 2 bacon slices, and a side of olives/cucumbers or wild planet sardines) and a small meal around 8:30 (example: a little zucchini pasta with parm cheese on top) See my blood work results below. I am not concerned much for LDL, as we know that this is not inherently bad and has to do with particle size, high testosterone, etc. but as far as HDL and Trigs, I wish the ratio was better. let me know our guys' thoughts...Maybe exercising more would help with trigs? Not sure... I would also appreciate any other comments anyone has on the rest of the blood results, if any. Thanks!

So, I thought it would be interesting to start a post where everyone can discuss how they are meeting their fat requirements while also staying away from milk. As someone who is lactose intolerant, I find it hard to meet fat requirements for keto as most keto recipes call for some kind of milky product to boost the fat content. I typically stay away from alternative milks and yogurts as well, so it really puts me in a bind of not using any “milk” based product. I understand the concept of healthy fats like avocados and nuts, but you literally have to eat so much of those to get to the fat requirements in a ketosis diet that it is ridiculous. Thus, why I thought it would be neat if everyone can discuss how they go about achieving their fat requirement while also maintaining their lactose intolerance condition. It help me get ideas of how to reach my own ketosis goals but possibly help other people out as well. 

Anyway, I guess I'll start with my own suggestion. Coconut oil based fat bombs. They are versatile and can take on any flavor combo. I typically make a chocolate flavored one with some cocoa powder or chocolate protein powder.

Hello! :) I'm currently 129lbs and looking to go down to 120 or 115. I've been keto for a month, low carb for two months. 

I've been eating exactly 25g net carbs daily (or often less) for a month now. I've restricted my calories to about 1,250 per day and have followed through the whole time; I track everything I eat with an app. I've also started drinking more water. 

I've done the strip test- my ketones are usually 4.0 to 8.0 and have been for a while. 
I also take extra ketone supplements in the morning and evening. 
Plus, to get over this plateau, I've started fasting too. I've been doing 14/10 for about 5 days now and still, the scale stays the same. 
I do light exercise- 20 mins cardio/ 30 mins weights three times a week. 

I've barely lost any weight... So far the loss total is about 1.5 lbs. 
The only significant change is that I get full a lot faster with less food, which is nice I guess.

Hi 

Little over a month ago i transitioned from a keto diet to a ”regular” diet because i wanted to enjoy myself with some candy and i didn’t feel like restricting anything anymore , it was fun at first and i was eating a bunch of chocolate and icecream almost every day , untill about a week ago. 

One day i waked up feeling very nauseus in the morning and i though it might have been food posioning from some really old garlic ive had the day before but the nausea didn’t go away. Almost every morning i wake up i feel very nauseus and unable to eat , it has been going on for weeks now 🥲.

This is very unusual for me since i use to like food and always think about tasty chocolate and stuff in the morning , but now i start getting slightly hungry around 7 - 9 hours after i wake up and when i do eat i am barley able to enjoy the food and i get filled up after a few bites and feel like i am gonna be sick😥...


What could be causing this? Diabetes/ketoacidosis? Food intolerance because i added a bunch of stuff i am not used to?

August 2018 we went on vacation, decided we weren’t gonna NOT eat carbs on vacation, we fell off the wagon.

Nothing Major tho, didn’t really lose any weight. Once the world shuts down, I get a treadmill and i start to run every morning, still eating carbs, snacking on candy and cake at night, but I lose about 25 pounds, I quit smoking. Most importantly, I’ve developed the habit of working out and running 5-6 times a week. 

I catch Covid in January, that took me down for 2 weeks, and I gained that weight back (25 I had lost). I still run and do sets of push ups 3-5 times a week, but I believe my poor diet is why I can’t lose any weight.

he’s open to all this. though he seems to be a bit shocked at how prevalent carbs are.

also, some foods aren’t good for diabetics (like coconut, right? that one always surprises me). but coconut is praised in keto diets (it seems). is there any risk for him, as a diabetic, in eating coconut? or the risk is for diabetics on regular (carb) diets?

I am female age 37,  5'6"" (167.6 cm), 269 lbs (122.4 kg) and my TDEE is 2300.

I started with the Noom app at the beginning of last October, which uses CICO and low fat and psychology to help people lose weight. I did lose a few pound the first few weeks and stayed between 1300-1500 calories through the end of January, except one day a week when I would eat around 2200 calories to stay sane. My weight was fluctuating crazy amounts from day to day, and ultimately I kept gaining and losing the same five to eight pounds for four months. I felt starving and miserable.

I switched to Keto at the beginning of February, and have been following macros (30 net carbs, 113g protein, 1600-1700 calories, no more than 115g fat) for the past four weeks. The first two weeks, I tried to keep the calories under 2000 while hitting 100+g protein and 30 net carbs, to give some allowance while I became fat adapted.  The first two weeks I ate anytime between 8am-8pm, and I have been gradually closing the window as my hunger goes down over the past four weeks. I currently keep no more than a six hour feeding window, and I don't go over my fat or calories. I'm down to a small meal around 1pm, and dinner around 6pm. If I get hungry before or after then, I'm using green tea and broth with cream added (and I add those calories to my log for the day). I'm staying away from nuts and cheese, unless they are a portioned amount in a salad or recipe. Meals are mostly eggs from my chickens, beef, chicken, salads, broccoli, cauliflower stir fry ""rice"", and green beans. I stopped any alcohol a month ago. I drink electrolytes daily and didn't have too much of an issue with keto flu. 

I was definitely sedentary last October, but started walking, and I walk about four miles a day now between work and an evening walk. I don't really exercise other than walks, but I wasn't capable of even what I'm doing now as of a few months ago, and I'm happy with my physical progress.

My issue is that I'm not losing any weight at all. The interesting thing is that the day-to-day fluctuations have diminished, and I am spot on 269 every morning. I've noticed less swelling in my feet and fingers, and my belly is maybe not so distended. I have not taken measurements, but I could. I just thought \*something\* would have happened by now on the scale, and it's really getting me down. My fasting glucose numbers have come down (\~145 in December to \~115 now), and my (male, 49) partner has lost 11 lbs eating the lazy version of what I am, so I feel like I'm so close yet so far. 

Has anyone ever experienced this not leading to weight loss? Should I try cutting calories more? Should I increase calories? Is my body healing and not capable of current weight loss? Could there be something else at play I'm unaware of? I did have blood work done within the last year which is what led to knowing I need to lower blood sugar and weight, but I have no other issues that came up in general blood work. I do have PCOS and have been heavy all my life. 

Sorry for the novel, and thank you so much for any input, musings, suggestions, resources, or commiserations!

After a rather embarrassing incident, I stopped eating as much as I used to and I avoided sugar and other processed foods as much as I could. After a few months of this, I reached 160 pounds. I stayed there for a while, after which I gained 11 pounds when lockdown started. So, I went on Keto. I did Keto for 3 months and went from 171 to 136 pounds. I did Keto+ 16/8 IF and no exercise. After I got off keto, I quickly reintroduced carbs and I regained the water weight and got up to 147 pounds. After which I started eating healthily, in a caloric deficit, but I wasn't losing weight (probably improper tracking of food intake), but I didn't gain any weight. So I got back on keto a week back and I've lost the water weight(143 pounds now) and I'm doing IF(16/18) as well. I started working out about 3 months ago and I've made huge improvements, with my chest looking amazing, arms looking big etc. I work out my abs religiously and my top 2 abs are fully developed and are also visible, even when I'm bloated, but I'm yet to lose my lower belly fat and my love handles. 

The whole reason I started this journey (has been 2 years) I only had one goal and that was to go back to having a flat stomach so that I could wear whatever I wanted to and to feel good about myself. When I lose the fat in my stomach, I will definitely have more abs, as I have put in the hardwood to work on my abs.

1- I know there is no such thing as spot reduction 

2- I know abs are made in the kitchen

3- I am doing IF 

4- I know belly fat is first in last out

I just wanted to update my situation and I know if I keep at it, I will eventually lose it. My freshman year starts in 3 months and I hope I can lose most of it by then, as I want to focus on gaining muscle in college.

I’m just over 1 month into keto and am down 30 pounds. I’m 6’3’’, 400lbs. 

I’ve found that I have little to no hunger after eating between 900-1400 calories, which is significantly lower than the 30% deficit I calculated of about 2,300 calories. When I eat over 2000 calories I feel weighed down and sluggish. However, I have read this can be detrimental to my health. 

If I meet my lean body fat protein goal of 150 grams, would that reduce any dangers?

so, being two weeks in, i know that i've dropped my water weight, but i'm unsure if any of the weight loss so far is actual fat. i know that once you've dropped your water weight, your body's ""weight loss"" slows (the number on the scale decreases less dramatically between weigh-ins just cause water weight drops instantly while fat takes more time). i know that this is going to discourage me when i weigh in at the end of next week and dont see another 5lb at the least shedded off. should i start walking or jogging, doing a 16/8 IF, or something else? 

i'm not capable of HIIT, I hate intense workouts like that, i'd much rather just jog or something, and i'm on contrave so i can do IF no problem. but are there any other ways to combat plateaus aside from what ive listed? i'm the type of the person that is discouraged very easily and i want to avoid this seemingly inevitable thing as much as possible.

I didn't weigh myself until I was 2 weeks into keto - at which point I got on a scale and saw 200 lbs. So my starting weight is something over 200 lbs. 

In 4 months I've lost more than 32 lbs (current weight 167.5, the least I've weighed in 4 years). I also stopped biting my nails (on accident -- the urge to bite disappeared about a week into changing my eating) and started exercising ever day. I didn't set out to become a person who works out -- but I changed my eating and after a month I thought, ""Maybe I could be a person who exercises,"" so I tried a little bit, and I love it more every day. All of this surprises and delights me. 

The foundation has been getting sugar and grains out of my life entirely -- leave those things out and suddenly I have room and energy for so much more. Very grateful to this community for the inspiration and wisdom you provide.

A little back ground on me Im a 37 male and have always been a heavy set guy but never had any health issues or performance issues and have maintained weight for the last 10 years between 305 and 315 lbs. During the pandemic i shot up to 352 my heaviest I have ever been and I really started to feel horrible. My knees hurt, my back hurt and I couldn't bend over to tie my shoes! But the worst part was that I could no longer enjoy sex like I used to. Not to mention that I could no longer see my own penis (I was horrified) lol. So that's when I decide it was time for a change.... Since then I have been doing a form of extreme keto were I only eat protein and limit carbs to only leafy greens (no starchy veggies like carrots or potatoes and only eat snacks with less than 1g of carbs like pork rinds. I combined that with a 48hour water fast every other day and eat Keto when I do eat. So far I feel great! I have more energy, better concentration and i can finally see my penis again LOL!

Before I get started, apologies for the format of this. I'm not super good at organizing my thoughts but I wanted to share my journey and the insights that have come to me along the way. Hopefully this is all decipherable. 

To begin with - I started my keto journey in late 2018 at a starting weight of 155 lbs and a goal weight of 110 lbs. I am 32F, 5'1"". See pictures in the imgur link at the bottom. NOTE: from the pictures 110 might be a little thin for me, but my rationale was that I might gain a lot of water weight and bounce back to 115 which I think is a maintainable weight that I would be really happy with. So that's how I came to my goal. 

Over the course of the next year and change, I lost a total of 39 pounds getting to a low weight of 116 pounds. Around January 2020, I took a 1 month keto break and went back up to 120. Staying on the horse after this break was difficult, and ultimately I fell off entirely when the pandemic hit. I ended up gaining 20 pounds back to 140.

Well New Year's came around, and I resolved to get back to my original goal weight of 110 lbs. 

I was pretty mad at myself that I let myself slip so much and let all that hard work go to waste, so I set a really aggressive goal of 2 lbs per week. Barring 1 or 2 bad weeks, I have kept up with this so far! It is now the end of Week 11 and I have lost 17 lbs. I definitely noticed I have lost weight a lot faster this time around. I don't believe it is because ""it's my second time"", but rather some key differences in the way I decided to approach Keto the second time and I'd like to share these with you.

Pre-Keto habits:

* **I was a fairly gluttonous person** with poor meal portion awareness/control. I just wanted to stuff my face all day everyday with my favorite foods, it was the most amazing and soothing feeling in the world.
* I lived for carbs. Pasta, pizza and potato chips specifically
* I loathed exercise

Keto first round (2018-2019) philosophy (**AKA THINGS NOT TO DO, even though I lost 39 lbs on it**):

* Diets had always failed for me, because I just wanted to always shove food in my mouth. I think the reason Keto initially worked for me was because, I figured out that as long as something had next to 0 carbs in it, I could basically eat as much as I wanted and still lose weight. This was basically a miracle diet for me. I made a list of foods that I didn't want to go without, found the ones that had very, very few carbs, and just shoveled those things into my face 24/7. In hindsight, this was really unhealthy but ultimately it got the ball rolling. But the takeaway is, **Keto initially worked for me because I was able to continue feeding my glutton habit.** 
* Toward the end of 2019, I was really beginning to crave carbs and would get sloppier and sloppier with takeout meals and cheat snacks. My rationale was ""the more fat I eat, the more carbs I can eat since really carb quota is based on percentage of total macros"". This led to **more snowballing with the gluttony**, and I found myself eating massive amounts of fat everyday to justify going up to 30 or 40 grams of carbs. I'm not sure if this logic actually holds true for Keto. I didn't gain weight, but I didn't lose weight either - probably due to the sheer calories in to calories out ratio.
* In the second half of 2019 I began to rely heavily on highly processed keto substitutes, what I call fake foods: products with wheat or milk protein isolate that mimicked puffy grains and cereals, baked goods such as cookies, brownies and cakes with fake sugar and almond/coconut flours, and substitute breads, such as almond meal bread, cloud bread, and whatever voodoo magic ThinSlim's breads are made of. At some point, my diet consisted of 80% or more of these packaged keto substitute fake foods, and I was barely even eating any veggies or meat. Once again, **my gluttonous tendencies had taken over** but this time I was trying to just eat as much comforting processed, easy-to-binge foods as possible. 
* I didn't have an exit strategy. My exit during January 2020 was basically, ""I miss carbs and I'm going to try to binge on them like crazy for a month to get the urge out of the way."" Yeah, right cadonana. This was dangerous, self-enabling, excuse-riddled talk. I never thought ahead to what my regular diet might look like after I hit my goal weight or came off keto. Heavens knows that the way I was eating was absolutely not healthy or sustainable, despite the fact that I was losing weight.

Queue the pandemic. Welllllll, old and constant friend Gluttony, let's see how we did:

* Absolutely just started eating my feelings and bingeing every processed comfort food in sight, in mass quantities. I'd run to the drug store in my PPE and clean out the kettle chips shelf once a week. Sometimes I'd sit in front of the TV and eat 2 bags of chips in one sitting. Rice, ramen, mac and cheese, pizza, oh my gosh. I'm surprised I didn't get diabetes during the pandemic. 
* I was also ""gluttonous"" in other ways. My retail therapy spending got out of control, and I found my front door being piled with packages of useless crap over the past year.

Hello 2021! Time for fresh starts and healthier perspectives. Well obviously, something had had to change. I had ballooned out to 140 lbs again. I was no longer fitting the new wardrobe I had bought myself in 2019. My bank account was drained. I was sleeping whenever possible, just barely doing the things I needed to. It was a pretty dark time for me. I felt like crap, physically and mentally. 

January 1st came around, and I resolved the next day I would stop shoveling mac and cheese into my piehole and start taking care of myself more. 

Here are the things I did differently the second time around:

* As mentioned before, I was pretty mad at myself and set an aggressive goal of 2 lbs per week. What really surprised me, 3 months in, is that I was able to more or less stick to this so far.
* I made a nifty chart (see link below) to track my progress and came up with some rewards for myself. I think this tracking chart actually helped my motivation immensely. It's so satisfying when I hit a day where I can color in another block! Note that I also laminated the chart, so I can erase progress in case I'm bad and gain weight again, haha. 
* Ironically, my severe spending habit in 2020 helped me in a way: In addition to starting up Keto again, I had put myself on a rather strict budget and savings goal for 2021. This helped me so much because I simply couldn't afford all those expensive, pre-packaged Keto fake foods that I had binged on so much in the year before. **I think the presence of really comforting, ""yummy"" foods in my cabinet really contributed to a binge addiction in 2019 for me**. 
* I'm focusing now on SIMPLE meals, 1) because I can't afford anything fancy or takeout right now, and b) I don't enjoy cooking and am too depressed/don't otherwise have energy to sink into preparing a nice meal. I think this, in combination with the lack of packaged fake foods, has really calmed down my so-called ""glutton response"". 
* Every now and then I do some meal prep and create some very tasty, complex keto dishes. Some examples are shirataki alfredo, or paneer tikka masala. However, I found that eating these foods completely triggered my glutton response. On the days I made these meals for myself, I would portion out enough for a whole work week but then eat it all in two days. **I just could not help myself with these more complex, savory meals. I would crave the flavor and the mouth feel so much that I literally could not stop myself from going back to the fridge for more**. In contrast, if I eat a simple meal of lightly seasoned roasted or steamed veggies with some simply cooked chicken for example, **I would always be satisfied with the portion I originally set for myself**. 
* The above 3 bullet points led me to realize that after all this time, after the 17 lbs I lost in 2021 and extreme self control I have exercised so far, **I still have an enormous psychological issue with food**. Okay, I know this was pretty obvious in hindsight, but I just couldn't define it well in my head. Maybe it's an addition to certain flavors or textures, maybe it's trying to fill the emotional void I feel with delicious foods. But now that I realized that, I'm going to avoid what I call ""complex meals"" (highly seasoned and well textured) until I can work with to figure out how to break the addiction. I will begin to work with a therapist soon on these issues!
* That being said, I do treat myself with a small packaged keto brownie every day or other day if I can afford to get some that week. But I make sure to get a bunch of one type at a time. This way I get sick of having the same treat every single day and it reduces my urge to binge, lol
* The last and (what I think is) most important point that I want to make is, that it is so, so, so much easier to restrict calories to a normal amount (as opposed to bingeing thousands of calories of fat) when you are not tempting yourself with your addictions all the time. Cramming your face with fat all the time for sustained period is not the way to go, like I did the first time. Sure, the benefit of losing weight more quickly right now is great because I am eating balanced (well, keto-balanced - still eating that scoop of cream cheese at the end of everyday to get my fat macros in), whole/real-food meals. But I'm realizing this is just so much healthier. I feel great, I have energy, I am happy with my weight loss. But most importantly, **I believe now that I can transition from this to a sustainable, permanent, healthy lifestyle after I come off keto**. I have identified a major psychological issue that I am going to address which will help me sustain a new lifestyle after I hit my goal weight. Because let's be real, life is better with carbs - but I only deserve them if I can stop myself from out of control shoving them in my face. And I believe I can achieve this.  

Next steps, and I think this is SO IMPORTANT!!!: **come up with an exit plan and permanent, healthy, maintainable lifestyle change for after I hit my weight goal.** Let's be honest. I love carbs. This second round of Keto has made me realize that I can have a healthy lifestyle of enjoying carbs for the rest of my life AND maintain the weight I want, if I only address my binge eating issues. I haven't come up with this plan yet, but on my list is:

* Experimenting in the weeks and months after I exit keto to find out what my ideal ""maintain weight"" calories/macros are, and factoring ""feeling good"" and ""having energy"" heavily into this. 
* Aggressively working on my bingeing issues in talk therapy. 
* Figuring out how to eat delicious foods that I'm likely to binge, without getting to that point
* Fun and maintainable exercise: A strength building routine, and finding a type of cardio that I don't hate. 

If you read all this, thank you! Again, sorry about the length and formatting/organization. I hope this helps people regardless!!

[See pictures of my progress and keto tracker here!](https://imgur.com/a/K1mex0m)

**tl;dr** 

* Eat real, whole foods during keto. Don't cheat with fake sugars, isolates. Rewarding occasionally is okay but be strict about how much you eat!
* This will help you with portion control and listen to your body to actually know when to stop eating. 
* Progress tracking charts are fun, helpful, and very motivational.
* Do some introspection and try to figure out your issues with food. This helped me discover a huge psychological issue I have with bingeing food and I'm going to get help in therapy for it now. 
* Now that I have discovered these things, I have so much hope that I can sustain a healthy diet  after I hit my goal weight and enjoy carbs/life in a healthy way!",True,False,False,keto,t5_2rske,2335323,public,self,Not my first rodeo - advanced lessons learned on Keto Round 2,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/m53kl2/not_my_first_rodeo_advanced_lessons_learned_on/,all_ads,6,TNT ,2c0c329e-abe8-11e8-a749-0ea6409e913c,Tips and Tricks,,,,,,,,,,,

I could really use some of your experiences here. Firs of all, sorry in advance for any mistakes, English isn't my native language. 


So it's my first time doing Keto, and I've been doing it for the last 10 days, and I really love it. It's the first time I actually feel happy while drastically changing my diet... so I really really don't want to quit. My clothes already feel a bit loose, I feel my arms thinner and I'm much less bloated in general. One thing I've noticed is that finally after months, my workouts are showing visible results. So I want to stick with it, as a lifestyle and not just as means to an end. The thing is, I'm starting to worry because I have a history of hereditary heart diseases, heart attacks, strokes, high cholesterol and hyperlipidemia... my logic was, ok If a stick with Keto, I will be able to burn more fast than I did before, so it's gonna be fine, but that traditional approach of ""too much fat is bad for your heart"" it's starting to get to me because I definitely have been feeling my heart racing a lot, while resting, feeling kind of dizzy at times, and also really hot, sweating a lot, and a bit shaky sometimes. The doctors here follows in general this traditional approach, so going to them with a family history of heart disease, and doing keto seems like a no no (that means I'm pretty sure they are going to tell me to quit). One uncle actually did it and the doctor said he was ""destroying his liver and heart"". So I wanted to know if any of you have a similar experience while doing Keto, and if so, what are some of the things you can naturally expect. Also, if some of you know of more updated studies about fat and heart diseases, I've been searching but all I can find are those whose conclusions are ""too much fat is bad for the heart"".

At the time I was really afraid, so I began researching the internet for the best diet to treat this disease which is when I first learned about keto. I was so impressed with the science behind it that I decided to give it a try. And it worked.

It only took a day or two before I saw my glucose numbers drop to a normal range. The combination of LCHF along with intermittent fasting and regular exercise worked like a charm. Until I entered a long-term depressive episode (unrelated to keto) and I stopped for about a year.

The second time on keto was even better. I managed to bring my A1C down from 12 to 5.6. Then, you guessed it, I fell into another year long depression and stopped again. I began a year long food indulgence spree and ate whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. And now I fear the damage is too great to reverse.

Last week, I started to feel extremely weak. It was so concerning that I decided to check my blood sugar for the first time in over a year. The number I saw on the glucometer shocked me: 423. I knew it would be high, but not THAT high. It was something I could no longer willfully ignore, and decided immediately to stop this vicious cycle I was putting myself through and return to keto.

At first everything seemed to be going in the right direction. My blood sugar was still high, but in the 200s now instead of the 400s. I began OMAD IF (my usual) and moderate exercise. Basically, the same routine I had done twice before that seemed to work well for me. 

But after a full week of returning to a healthier lifestyle, I'm starting to feel defeated. I feel like the damage I've done to my body is too much and now it can't be fixed. I just CANNOT get my blood sugar below 200 anymore. Before it was so easy to do. Yesterday morning my glucose was at 234, and after drinking coffee with a tablespoon of heavy cream, it shot up to 320. This didn't make any sense to me. How can zero carbs cause such a dramatic insulin spike?

This post is already way longer than I intended it to be, so I'll just end it here. I didn't really know where else to turn. I feel like giving up, because I feel like it's too late for me. But at the same time I know keto is the best thing for me. And I'm too scared to go to the doctor because I don't want to start taking insulin.

However, I’m concerned a little bit about oxylates and their ability to chelate other minerals and remove them from your body. I know that you can greatly diminish the oxylates by steaming or cooking – but that diminishes the ease of use, and I frankly don’t like cooked spinach as much as raw.

But, here’s my question, given the fact that spinach is so naturally high in minerals – like iron, magnesium, etc. – I’m wondering if the oxylates could be pretty much already be bound to plenty of minerals already?

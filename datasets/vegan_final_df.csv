At the same time, I am fairly uneducated when it comes to nutrition. I’ve always been basically an accidental intuitive eater, which worked when it was just me, but I’m worried about maintaining my milk supply and ensuring that my baby gets everything he needs.

To this end, I want to go to a dietician for some advice. But I live in the Midwest and am nervous that I will not find one who is supportive. For example my therapist is actively against this decision (I don’t totally understand why; I think she’s worried it’s too big a lifestyle change to take on while I’m also dealing with a newborn). 

I’ve reached out to two dieticians I found online who had veganism listed as a speciality and not heard back. Wanted to ask this forum for some advice:

1. Any other EBF parents who have some advice that worked for them? (Not medical advice for me obvi)

2. What are watch outs when I do meet with a dietician? For example from reading this sub I know that not getting enough protein is a myth and if they bring that up they probably aren’t the right fit. Other topics I should make sure they do or don’t bring up? Common myths, etc to be aware of here? 

3. General advice on the switch appreciated!! 

For context on what I’m doing currently (started around a week ago): all meals are vegan (cooking everything at home), taking b12, but haven’t cut out dairy everywhere because I haven’t started reading labels closely for hidden things (for example ate some tortilla chips yesterday that it turns out had dairy in them.

She still views cows, pigs, and chickens as ""food"". So materials that challenge that view may be the most effective.   


Hard part: Send me all the arguments people have said at you for why you shouldn't be vegan. I'm really struggling with this. I just can't fathom not being vegan, so arguing this side is going to be a huge challenge. But the better I argue, the better she has to (and the better she'll engage with the material.).

I've been taking a multivitamin since then, I tried to stop taking it a few months ago but experienced a lot of dizziness.

I've been eating healthier now the past few months and want to try to stop taking my multivitamin again as I really don't want to have to take one. But when I look up how to get every nutrient/vitamin naturally it seems a bit pricey for certain things.

For example, to get omega 3 I need to buy like flax seeds or chia seeds or seaweed which is really not within my budget?

I apologize, but I'm going to rant for a minute. I had someone tell me recently ""If you were a ***real*** environmentalist, you wouldn't invest in crypto"". I mean, yes, crypto definitely has an environmental impact. But so does posting on Reddit, using Facebook, streaming videos and/or music on Netflix/Spotify. If our society ran on renewables, this wouldn't even be an argument. I hope that one day our society will diverge fully from fossil fuels onto renewables, and I am trying to make that happen as best I can but I'm only one person with limited capital and influence doing what I believe is possible to make a difference. But getting back to the main reason for this post.

That statement. It felt like it negated all of the changes that my wife and I have made in the last four years trying to be more environmentally-conscious and pro-animal safety and health. We use as little plastic as we can. We recycle as much as we can. We share a vehicle and only use it when absolutely necessary. We rarely travel. We compost. We eat a vegan diet, and avoid animal products as much as we can when it comes to other products.

I refuse to quit because of things like that. I believe in the beauty of this planet and the right to life of all the beings on it. I will do what I can to help protect it. I don't even have kids (nor do I want them) but I do want them to be able to look forward to the future like I did when I was younger. I feel sorry for the generations after me. I feel like they are definitely getting the short stick in terms of crumbs to live off of after my generation and those before me are gone.

Everyone seems to have this ""all or nothing"" mentality when it comes to making real change when in fact, this is often not feasible at all. When it comes to being a vegan, we went all in on that right off the hop, but I find most people like to break into it slowly. Maybe cut out meat gradually, then dairy, then eggs. Small changes lead to big things when done on a large scale. I saw a statement somewhere once that really resonated with me. It was something to the effect of ""We don't need a few people making major changes to get things on track, we need the majority of people making a few changes"".

This is a fact of life ... and the marvellous thing about a fact is that one can not argue with it. One can argue about a belief, an opinion, a theory, an ideal and so on ... but a fact: never. One can deny a fact – pretend that it is not there – but once seen, a fact brings freedom from choice and decision. Most people think and feel that choice implies freedom – having the freedom to choose – but this is not the case. Freedom lies in seeing the obvious, and in seeing the obvious there is no choice, no deliberation, no agonising over the ‘Right’ and ‘Wrong’ judgment. In the freedom of seeing the fact there is only action.

When it comes to the consumption of nutrients there are many and various beliefs one can hold dearly to. There are people who will not eat red meat at all ... only white meat and fish. Then there are people who will not eat any flesh of warm-blooded animals at all ... only fish and reptiles. Then there are people (**vegetarians**) who will not eat any meat at all, but will consume eggs and dairy products. Then there are people (**vegans**) who will eat only vegetables, grain and seed. Then there are people (**fruitarians**) who will only eat fruit. Then – as we go into myth and fantasy – there are those who live on water and air ... and finally those who live on air only!

Some vegetarians maintain that as a carrot (for example) does not scream audibly when it is pulled from the ground there is no distress caused by the consumption of vegetables. Yet the carrot indubitably dies slowly by being extracted from its life-support system – the ground is its home – and is this not distressing on some level of a living, growing organism? It all depends upon the level, or degree, of ‘aliveness’ that one ascribes to things. Vegans, for instance, will not consume eggs as this prevents an incipient life from being born. Fruitarians go one step further and say that, as the consumption of carrots prevents them from going to seed and sprouting new life, vegetables are to be eschewed entirely. Then, as the eating of grain and seeds also prevent potential life-forms from growing, they will eat only the flesh of the fruit that surrounds the kernel and plant out the embryo plant-form (I have been a fruitarian so I know full well what I am speaking of).

The obvious fact is clearly demonstrated by taking all this to its ultimate consideration. What will one do – as a fruitarian causing no pain or the taking of life of anyone or anything – about those pesky things like mosquitoes, sand-flies, cockroaches, rats, mice and other ‘vermin’ that invade my house? Put up screens? What about outside? Will I slap them dead ... or just shoo them away? What will one do if attacked by a snake, a crocodile, a shark, a lion and so on? Do as the Revered Scriptures say and turn the other cheek? Will I humbly submit to my fate and be mauled severely myself – or even killed – simply because of a religious injunction, a moral scruple, a noble ideal, a virtuous belief, a passionate opinion, a deeply held ethical theory? In other words, have animals and insects been given the right, by some inscrutable god, to do with me whatsoever they wish? Is my survival dependent upon the non-existent benevolence of all those sentient beings that I am not going to cause distress to?

What then about germs, bacteria, bacillus, microbes, pathogens, phages, viruses and so on? Are they not entitled to remain alive and pain free? If one takes medication for disease, one is – possibly painfully – killing off the microscopic creatures that one’s body is the host too. Some religions – the Jain religion in India, for example – has its devout members wearing gauze over their nose and mouths to prevent insects from flying in and they even carry small brooms to sweep the path as they walk so that they will not accidentally step on some creature. It can really get out of hand. For instance, small-pox has been eradicated from the world by scientists as a means of saving countless human lives ... is this somehow ‘Wrong’? What is ‘Right’ in regards to what I do in order to stay alive? If I do none of these things then I will be causing pain and suffering to myself ... and I am a sentient being too. It is an impossible scenario, when pursued to its ultimate conclusion.

And then there is the matter of one’s fellow human beings. Some of them – in fact at times a lot of them – are desirous of invading the country that one is living peacefully in, with the avowed intent of killing, torturing, raping, pillaging and subjugating oneself and one’s fellow citizens. If one holds a strong and passionate belief in not causing any pain and suffering to other sentient beings then one must be more than a fruitarian ... one must be a pacifist as well. This amounts to hanging out a sign – if everybody else in the country one lives in adopts this specific belief – which says, in effect: ‘Please feel free to invade us, we will not fight back, for we hold firmly to the principle of not causing pain and suffering to any sentient being whatsoever’ (the Tibetan situation is a particular case in point). Thus anarchy would rule the world ... all because of a belief system handed down by the Saints and the Sages, the Messiahs and the Avatars, the Redeemers and the Saviours, the Prophets and the Priests, century after century.",True,False,False,vegan,t5_2qhpm,590394,public,self,The essay that convinced me to become a vegan,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/ms80pc/the_essay_that_convinced_me_to_become_a_vegan/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So basically to go vegan. 🌱

I'm female, 21, and a Vegetarian for a couple of years already, and actually a huge cheese fan. Yikes.

How I ended up in my situation:
After I turned Vegetarian, I regularly got a rash or something at the finger knuckles of my right hand  - It swells, turns red, tickles and when you touch it, it hurts. This would occur every few months from then, staying for two weeks and then disappear. I hoped it would go away at some point. (I can't tell if turning Vegetarian was the reason it appeared,  I just know it's been happening for couple of years now)

Then a few months ago I started to get a stomach ache consistently, nearly every day. It's not strong or anything, but just always there.
It also didn't get better when I switched to oat milk (which is so much better than normal milk, whowie!). 🥳

Now I've went to let someone check my hand, and she was asking me if it occurs when I'm on my period, which isn't the case. (It could be because of hormones).
 So next she asked me how my stomach is feeling and I admitted that it troubles me a lot (Funnily I had to think for a moment cause the tummy ache was so normal for me 😅). 
She said, my intestine, so my stomach isn't alright, it afflicts my skin. She recommended me to leave out any milk products for at least four weeks and watch it. 👍🏻

Soooo I'm excited to go vegan!
Problem: I'm still living with my parents who aren't tooooo happy about me being Vegetarian already.... but they get vegetarian options for me at least. 🙈
But I can't stay dependant on them forever! Especially if I happen to become Vegan. I cant expect them to cook for me anymore. I need to... grow up 😱

But.... I'm just a terrible cook, and to be completely I've never been interested in cooking. It seems like such a bothersome task.. coming up with an idea, getting ingredients, stand there for 2 hours... 🙄 I'm lazy, I recognised it myself, thank you.
 
So I'm asking you guys for ANY useful advise that you can give me. Whether it is about motivating myself to cook, or vegan recipes, or venting about me being lazy, anything!
Also, do you agree with her theory that the skin rash is directly connected to my stomach condition? 
I appreciate any message I get 🙏

The story is somewhat funny. I'm 17, come from a family living in a rural nowhere. Family's quite conservative and all. And basically, my mother started having troubles with her arm, which hurt a lot, two months ago. She can't do all the things she did before so my parents...Dumped it all on me. I'm the only girl and I have two brothers. Before that, it was my mother doing most of the chores and all, with me helping.

Ok.

Mind you my dad won't do shit either, of course.

So I decided to make it suck. As I said it's quite a conservative family and for some reason my little brother had something specifically against vegans. Literally would make up obviously fake stories about ""annoying vegan girls"" at school that he dissed (he is 15, also I'm literally in the same school). My whole family is the kind that'd say ""Bacon lol"" if someone says they are vegan.

I'm the one doing all the cooking now. So we went vegan. They hate it by principle. They hate it especially when I make something good and they ask what's in it and realize it's vegan. Now they aren't fooled anymore and just say everything tastes disgusting by default. Mind you none of them have taken up cooking lmao. They have taken up snacking madly on junk food though. 

Looking for vegan recipes made me read more and more into veganism. And definitely convinced me slowly but surely. And I discovered lots of vegan alternatives to foods I used to love (though there isn't much vegan meat and whatever where I live lmao).

I have friends in a discord server. One of them I've known for about a year. The others are newer friends. The friend I know has always been very serious about immediately stopping any sort of mockery or bashing towards another person, and they've always been open minded, which is a quality in them I've always admired.

Well today, they bring up a certain controversial vegan activist in the chat, which is fine. I was a bit nervous because I was scared the conversation would go wrong, but these people are aware that I am vegan, and there are other vegans in the server as well. I figured that they could have their conversation respectfully, and chose not to participate. 

Well, it got out of hand. All of a sudden there's these "" Lol I bet \[activist\] is one of those vegans who xx"", and ""lol vegans like that make me want to eat a ton of meat"", and just things that were extremely offensive to me, especially because these people were having a completely different conversation with me in another channel while saying all of this.

Anyway, I finally said something, because it was genuinely giving me anxiety, and they just seemed like...more interested in telling me that I'm wrong than actually listening to me when I say that xx or xx is wrong and is extremely offensive to say. They essentially asked me why it was offensive, and I told them, and they told me I was wrong, and then when I said otherwise they just shut the whole thing down.

I don't know. I just feel..judged? Secretly? And also it feels very backhanded that all other mockery towards any group or anything is banned, but this was okay? Like maybe that's how they really feel about me? And maybe I'm not really wanted in that space either way. Which frankly, I don't want to be in spaces that treat me like that.

I don't know. It just feels really shitty, because I feel backstabbed. Maybe I expected something in the friendship in regards to a level of respect for my ethics and beliefs, because if I said something really offensive about a friend of mine's beliefs, I'd want to know so that I can apologize and make sure they knew that I understood how offensive that could be, and that I'd do what I could to ensure that sort of conversation wouldn't happen again.

I suppose this seems like an unnecessary rant, we’ve probably all felt this way, but I cannot understand how this is happening. How can we do this? I care about the environmental aspect of all of this as well, but even if none of that was a factor, this pain and torture is abominable. If anyone has any belief that we should do good in the world and not cause harm, then you cannot support this industry. The disrespect we’re showing these creatures is like something out of Saw. It should not exist.

I know if any piglet of calf were rescued they could bond just as much with me. 

I just wish I could Thanos style snap them out of existence. Maybe that’s cruel too, but it seems better than what they have. Ideally I wish they could live free lives, but what would that mean to a genetically altered beast that no longer has any part in the natural ecosystems. We alter the world with no regard for what could happen. And we deserve whatever we get because of it. It’s breaking my heart that we’re taking everything else with us.

So for some context I'm a 14 year old girl still living with my parents (non-vegans) and I'm not completely committed yet I'm just trying my hardest.
About a month ago we were having brunch and the topic of veganism was brought up, my sister was talking about how it really saves the planet to be vegan, and my dad got super defensive and went on about how eating meat is necessary, beneficial and the normal thing to do, you know the usual excuse, and so i stepped in giving my opinion, and i said something along the line of ""animals shouldn't suffer for the sole purpose of our taste pleasure"" and my dad got SO mad, and went on an hour long rant about why we're basically entitled and are supposed to use animals for food and other things.
And ever since that conversation, every SINGLE day, and every fucking time he gets the chance to, he forces me to eat meet.
Literally whenever we go out to a restaurant or something he orders a very meat based meal for me, and  forces me to eat it??
I tried telling him that i was ""convinced"" of what he told me last time about this subject, and I've expressed to him multiple times how uncomfortable this makes me feel.
Idk if I'm over-reacting or anything, or if this seems stupid  in some way, but im getting to tired of this it's kinda getting depressing.

First time posting here.

I’m several months into the veggie lifestyle. I’m personally loving it. I love the food I make. I feel great physically and emotionally. I’m healthier than ever. I no longer feel guilty for contributing to the mistreatment of animals or damage done to the environment. 

But... I’m feeling defeated af. I just want to share all the stuff I’ve learned over my, albeit recent, journey with others because I’m excited about it. I’ve read so many science-based books and studies, as well as watched a lot of documentaries about the harms of eating animals and animal byproducts. 

Unfortunately, people are so biased to eating meat and just blatantly misinformed about the evidence behind the harm of it all. I find myself trying to be as objective and science-based as possible, but I wind up getting into debates I didn’t want to get in. I don’t want to be *that person* who comes across as the condescending vegan forcing their beliefs down someone else’s throats... because apparently that’s just automatically how you’re perceived as soon as someone learns you don’t eat meat and care about the planet. Insert eye roll here. I just want to be an advocate without being too much. 

I just want to help other people. I wish I had known about all the health benefits to eating plant-based much sooner. I wish I had known the full extent about how even just drinking milk and supporting the dairy industry results in cows suffering. I was just blissfully ignorant I guess. But I really wish I had made the switch years ago. 

Anyways, any advice on how to not feel so sad and defeated about people just not caring about going plant-based?

This stance has expanded over the years to include the obvious environmental argument for a reduced land-use impact on the world and reduction of the high greenhouse gas emissions that result from raising the billions of animals we slaughter every year. 

I haven't however yet went so far as to cut out animal products, such as eggs and dairy, especially as I can buy some of them from a farm near my house that has a  lovely sense of animal welfare. But after speaking with my roommates more about reducing our individual impacts, I decided to look closely at what the emissions are of the foods that I commonly eat, and, wow:

It turns out cheese, chocolate, and coffee account for the bulk of what's left of my food-related greenhouse emissions. The rough ball park is that my consumption of just those three products leads to about 500kg of CO2 equivalents being emitted per year. Equal to roughly what I emit from power consumption or traveling by bus/subway/rail. The rest of my food consumption combined probably only equals 200-300kg of CO2, with a lot of that being from olive oil. 

(Using the data found here:)
https://ourworldindata.org/food-choice-vs-eating-local

It's a tough sell for me, as I like practically every cheese and would put it on every meal in some way. Chocolate isn't a huge deal for me, and I've replaced coffee with some other coffee-like products made from wheat that don't have caffeine but do the trick for me. 

Probably I will take an approach to reduce my consumption, allowing the odd cheesy treat instead of having it be a very regular part of my purchases/diet.

Karpuraja, who initially spotted the sparrow and its eggs said,

&gt;""Nearly 100 families are there in this region and around 35 streetlights are used here. One day, when we were passing by the switch board, we noticed that a sparrow had laid three eggs. We immediately took pictures of them and posted it in our village WhatsApp group, and asked people to cooperate and not use electricity connected to the switch box so that the eggs hatch and the bird grows.""

35 streetlights were connected to this switchboard but still these villagers don't operate this switchboard to avoid accidentally damaging sparrow's eggs.Even women who are usually worried about going out in dark decided to keep their fear away to help the sparrow!

Nowadays, it's rare to see sparrows in cities.

When cellphone towers in cities are getting increased for our comfort without considering their effects on sparrows , these villagers kept themselves in darkness so that sparrow's offsprings can see the light.

***This Indian villagers love towards a single sparrow amazed me today.***

This was a question posed to sadguru jaggi vasudev on on the cruelty to bovines by consuming milk. Sadguru responded to the query saying that it is better if we consume milk because the alternative is worse for the cow and it would land up at the abattoir. Also if something is not useful to human society we do not let it survive. He provides the example of dogs being tied up or caged. If dogs are let loose, things could be worse for civilization, he argues. 
I see a point in what Sadguru says and am bit confused on the macro factors of going vegan. Wanted to know the community's thoughts.

Anyway, would anyone recommend any spreads and stuff to put on bread and rolls? My absolutely favourite food is bread with butter and tomato lol, but after I finish the butter I have, I want to still be good with eating that, without butter.

* Peel the onions, garlic and ginger, wash the chillies and remove the stems. Chop everything as finely as possible. Heat the oil in a large pan or in a wok and sauté the mixture over medium heat until the onions are lightly browned. Now add the minced meat and fry for about 5 minutes. Keep mixing the mince with the onion mixture and pounding it so that it is nice and crumbly.
* Dust with cumin, coriander, paprika and turmeric and fry for 1 minute. Stir in the tomato paste, season with salt and pepper and fry for 1 minute. Then mix in the yogurt with a little water, put the lid on and simmer on a low heat for about 15 minutes. Pour in some water every now and then (about 200-250 ml in total).

Vegan:  “oh thank you, they’re vegan leather because the factory farming industry is destroying the planet and I just can’t contribute to that.” 

No one enjoys mealtime with vegans. They are not fun to cook for because they ask too many questions about the food you had to go online to find a vegan recipe for; and they also manage to suck to go out to eat with as well. They either have to go to specific restaurants or they have to spend 10 minutes modifying something on the menu. The prospect of eating with them is a chore and it inconveniences everyone involved. 

Vegans use weird products and further vegan they go, the weirder the products they use. Some things used by vegans are okay such as essential oil diffusers, others aren’t. I’ve seen hard core vegans use natural deodorants, smelled them too, may as well have rubbed apricot and ass under their armpits. The worst I’ve seen was a coworker of mine with yellow teeth using fluoride free natural toothpaste.

Vegans act like their minute dietary change is ‘who they are as a person now’ and base their whole persona off of it; but that trait can primarily be attributed to one of the main causes of veganism, which is the lack of enough personality traits to make them interesting as normal people. This needs to stop. I like the idea of being vegan, I like vegan food, I see nothing wrong with veganism except for the people. It’s not a loud minority, it’s the lot.

I’m not saying veganism is politically related, but I’ve just noticed that most vegans are liberal. I’ve also seen lots of conservatives completely trash on vegans.

I believe that veganism doesn’t have a political affiliation just as like how being against slavery doesn’t have a political affiliation. I’m really big on free thought, valuing facts over emotion (which conservatives constantly promote), and I view this as being 100% in line with being vegan. Ignoring animal slaughter and torture is the OPPOSITE of “facts over feelings.” If you feel so strongly about your love of meat and are willing to ignore all the facts that meat/meat products do to the world and to animals - then that is the definition of being ~too sensitive~

On the other hand I do think that liberalism ideology *today* is not very rooted in facts at all. The social change that liberals tend to promote going on now (feminism, racial movements, etc), in my opinion, has taken a dark turn don’t make a whole lot of sense when you look at the facts. I obviously support equality for all races, genders, sexual orientations, everything! But the ideological underpinning of what the movements  have become today is something I don’t necessarily agree with. And I just think they are so dissimilar from being vegan but are branded the same way!

And if you don’t care, then just say you don’t care but don’t brand vegans as being “touchy feely” when its tangible, harmful effects are supported by so much evidence.

I suppose that most of the correlation of how vegans are usually left-leaning is because liberals are known for being big on social change and conservatives are more adamant on traditional values.

I love the food. I'm moving to Seattle soon, and the few times I've visited there, I was blown away by the all-vegan restaurants. In 21 years living on Earth, I'm not exaggerating when I say the best food I've ever eaten in my life was from an all-vegan restaurant in Seattle (if you live in Seattle, you might know the place I'm talking about; it's in Greenlake 😉). But it's not just restaurants. Vanilla Oat Yeah is, like, my favorite drink. It's so delicious and I'm not surprised big dairy is scared of veganism because cow's milk was never as good as oat milk. 

I love the people. Vegans are some of the coolest people I know. Vegans are brave. You have to be brave to stand up to a cultural institution that's as huge and oppressive as carnism, to stand up to friends and family who constantly ridicule and question us. Vegans are kind. It shouldn't take a lot of empathy to realize that animals' lives are more important than humans' taste buds, but it does, and you can see it in the way vegans talk to and support each other and interact with animals and the world around them. 

Finally, I love the animals. When you think about it, not harming animals is such a simple and obvious thing, which is why we say it's the moral baseline. It *is* the  moral baseline. But I still love it. I love knowing that when I say I care about animals, it's not hollow and ironic. I love petting my cat and knowing that farmed animals have just as much individuality and personality as she does, and that I'm no longer supporting their torture and murder.

This was one of the recipes that I got from here: [https://vegfaqs.com/vegan-seitan-recipes/](https://vegfaqs.com/vegan-seitan-recipes/)   


Instructions that I remember from the site:  
1. mix dry ingredients

2. mix in wet ingredients

3. knead by hand for 2 minutes

4. cut into small pieces and put in instant pot along with 1 cup of water

5. set instant pot to manual high and cook for 15 minutes

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever I make this, I always find that it's really chewy and rubbery. Is it an issue with the ingredients or do I just need to cook it less or something? I really like the convenience of the instant pot so I've stuck with this ever since I found it since most of the other recipes I've come across don't use the instant pot.

I live in a vegetarian home(religious reasons) they consider meat to be a bad karma, but then go on and eat milk, curd etc.

After learning about veganism, I immediately stopped eating eggs, my brother followed(only my dad eats eggs) This was easiest move to make.

I need to study 10-12 hours a day, so I am not in any position to make my own food, I stopped drinking milk, eating curd etc.

Half of food we eat is already vegan by default But still, my family has to put butter/ghee on other half, I have to eat what has been put on plate. I don't even enjoy the taste anymore, thinking about all the exploitation.

I even tried explaining my family, who consider cow to be so called 'sacred' about the horrors of dairy industry, on one hand, they generously donate to cow shelters, on other hand keep using milk.

I can't even argue with them, it's peak time of my eams, and the'll say focus on studies not on this. I know my parents really love me and all, but this is just torture. I hope I soon join college and finally adopt veganism in a few months.

I became vegan just 2 months ago, but I think this might help someone. 

I used to be a massive meat eater, just 2 months ago. Seriuously I couldn't rember going more than 1 day without some type of meat before going vegan (im serious). I used to proud myself in saying ""if it doesn't contain meat, its not a real meal."" Obviusly that was a joke, but there was truth to it for sure. 

The first week going vegan I felt absolutely miserable. I thought I would never enjoy food again. ALL of my favourite recepies not only included meat and dairy, but basically revolved around them. I was actually super depressed. I even made a post here lol. I remeber trying a beyond burger, and literally thinking ""yep, this doesn't taste anything like meat, I guess I am cursed to never enjoy food in my life."" Also cooking vegan bolognese fot the first time, and remeber trying it out and just throwing the whole pot away because it was gross.

Then for some reason, I swear to Zeus, after trying my second beyond burger (since the only way to get it was to buy the 10-pack) I was like ""what the hell, this isn't bad at all?"". Third time trying it, I was hooked. Its really bizzare, that it changed so quickly, but I remeber the first time the smell while it was raw (cat food, lets be honest) and grilling was foul to me. I still is, but when grilled, its godlike. Like serously, I make sure not to eat more than 1 or 2 every 2 weeks, since it isn't the healthiest food, but I would crush them and inject them in my bloodstream if I could now. Well made beyond burger with sexy lettuce, juciy tomatos, fried onions, spicy jalapeños, BBQ and chipotle sauce and baked potatos, oh lordy. Im a simple man, and thats a food orgasm to me. 

Also I tried to make a few adjustements to my vegan bolognese and it turned out extrenely delicious, literally the polar opposite of my first try.

What I wanted to say with this is don't get discouraged at the beggineng. Some things are different when it comes to recepies and it will take you some time to adjust. But I have to say, for me it changed super quickly. Way quicker than I would have thought. I haven't craved meat at all and I have never been a big cheese person anyway (I did buy vegan cheese for my bolognese and it was dope too!!). 

So if anyone is currently starting out, just because you currently feel like shit, doesn't not mean its your new ""normal"". Its NOT! Just experiment and check out youtube channels or articles. Trust me you are gonna find delicious food, and learn to make it.

It's very unlikely that we will be able to halt animal farming on the ethical arguments for reducing the suffering of sentient beings alone.  People want to eat meat regardless of the horrors necessary to produce it under current conditions.  

Aside from animal harm, we know that animal farming has led to zoonotic diseases that are responsible for virtually every pandemic in history, but that hasn't stopped us either.

If the biggest reason people don't care about the harms that animal farming has on people and other animals is that they just like the taste, then an actual cell-based meat would be the best alternative, right?

The problem is, this industry would have to compete with not only the meat industry, but also with plant-based industries.  I've seen the cost of lab meat go down drastically in 10 years, and really hope to see this alternative in the future, because it's probably our best shot at a healthier and more ethical future for people and other animals alike.

&amp;#x200B;

*'Some facts are inaccurate'* 

But the majority that are accurate are still painting a pretty horrific picture! 

&amp;#x200B;

*'Rural communities need fish to survive'*

Um yeah of course, they aren't the issue! You sitting at home eating fish three times a week are! As the director said  “The people that rely on those fish, the best thing we can do to ensure that they can survive – and that there’s enough fish for them to eat is – for us people who have the privilege to avoid eating it.” 

&amp;#x200B;

*'This documentary reeks of white saviour and of blaming minorities'*

The director is Iranian, and by far the worst images are from a bunch of white people using modern technology for their 'traditional' whale genocide day. I think its just blaming humans to be honest.

&amp;#x200B;

*'Sustainable fishing is the only way to save the ocean'*

What are you even on about. That's like trying to save someone's life by stabbing them with a knife made out of 100% recycled material.  

&amp;#x200B;

*'Vegan alternatives are just as bad, they do just as much damage and take up just as much land'*

First off, no they don't. You only have to look at the percentage of land used to feed animals to see where most of the land usage is going. Secondly, demand leads to innovation. With our population boom, we won't be able to sustain any diet, let alone one that requires the mass production of live animals to feed us. I definitely think a large percentage of our future food is going to be produced artificially, including meat and fish.

I think we all agree the reason that eating animals is wrong is because animals have the capacity to suffer. This means it's equally wrong to kill and eat a chip vs a fish, as intelligence is not directly linked to ability to suffer . What if, however , biologists developed a version of an animal that has guaranteed no ability to suffer? Either the part of their brain that registers pain and fear is turned off, or they actually enjoy being killed and eaten (like that one cow in HitchHikers guide to the galaxy's restaurant at the end of the universe).

the oil in it is sunflower seed oil, which is extremely high in omega 6, which can be a huge problem for dogs on a vegan diet, it causes a lot of inflammation and it severely limits their conversion of ala to dha and epa (omega 3)


and this is why after switching my dogs to vdog nuggets they have become really itchy and keep biting their bodies.

Since vegan dogs are not recieving dha and epa (which either comes from fish or algae), and they're recieving ala Instead, then they would have enough omega 3 to combat the inflammation from high Omega 6 intake, which makes high omega 6 intake a much bigger problem for vegan dogs than non vegan dogs.

You can give dogs algae oil, but it's not necessary, it's better to switch them to a good vegan dog food that doesn't use a high omega 6 oil, then they won't have high omega 6 levels and they would also be able to convert ala to dha and epa.

Sadly, i have a 15kg unopened bag of vdog nuggets that they have to go through, so i may order them algae oil while they go through it so that it helps with their skin problems from the high omega 6 content in their dog food

Not even to be a preachy vegan about it, this is just straight up incorrect usage of the word. People opt for euthanasia when they have painful terminal illnesses, I get my cat euthanised when she's old and suffering.

It's not possible to euthanise a healthy young bull, chick, or even an older layer hen (who is at least as healthy as she was when she was pushing out an egg a day), because by definition euthanasia is killing to end suffering.

I have been vegan for 3 or so years now and I never thought I'd have a problem with my partner eating meat but I'm finding myself feeling conflicted about this situation. 

Let me tell you about my partner. He is a young adult from East Malaysia and we have known one another for 3 years in a long distance relationship. One time early on in the relationship he sent me a very long list of reasons why veganism is not good, most of them were health reasons. He now has come to respect my diet and even supports my vegan page. He even sends me recipes now. I've never once said anything about his diet and simply stated that I'm fine with him just as long as he doesn't expect me to cook for him.

The problem I have with him is the insane variety of meats he eats. He consumes everything from pangolin, frogs, insects, jellyfish, crocodile, water monitors, frogs, pig insides... The list is endless, and of course he eats the standard pork, beef chicken and fish. He also slaughters animals when it comes to traditional native festivities. This as you might imagine is very hard for a vegan to tolerate, and I feel I am coming to a point where I might burst if he tries to describe to me what a squirrel tastes like again. 

I know it's not his fault I feel this way because I've never confronted him. And when I've shown discomfort he gently says he'll never let me see the slaughters and that I must understand it is just ""traditional"". And that this is how Malaysia is. It's the norm. I don't believe that it's difficult to go against the norm nor find vegan or vegetarian dishes there, having gone myself.

I want to know if anyone else has been in a similar situation and how I can change his ways of eating but I don't know how to begin. When I ask my parents they just say I must respect that or leave him. I love him incredibly and want to show him how amazing veganism or even just reducing meat intake can be.

When I was 13 I went from a 22 BMI to 18 BMI in a little over a month because I was starving myself. People started to notice and I was basically forced to eat more until I gained the weight back. Later that year I started throwing up my food to avoid gaining weight. I would regularly pass out. 

When I was 14 I came across a vegan YouTuber and my first reaction was “how fucking stupid” but then after listening and looking at more vegan youtubers and eventually watching ‘earthlings’ I knew I could no longer support the meat or dairy industry. 

I went whole-food vegan. And after a few months I noticed I was at my desired weight (about 135lbs and 19.5 BMI) it took no effort whatsoever either. Months go by and I wouldn’t lose or gain any weight despite not looking at my calorie consumption and eating plenty of food. I also felt happier and had more energy. 

Fast forward to today I’m 22 years old and have had no issues with my eating disorder. I’m still at around 135lbs average and I couldn’t be happier.

A few months ago I was watching a lot of vegan media on YouTube and I went vegan again (previously was vegan a few years ago) and it really helped me to stop binging!! It was such a great thing and I felt so good in so many ways. 

Then, after a while, I had one big binge and I ate animal products in it. It's been about 2 weeks of me not eating vegan again since then and it 100% just stems from me being unconscious to my truer wants and being out of control to the binging. 

My stomach has been in constant pain from the meat and dairy products honestly. I think it's incredible how once you stop something you realize what a strange ""normal"" you were accustomed too. 

I also quit coffee 2 months ago and I used to think I just naturally went to sleep at 11 pm-1 am but now I get proper tired between 9-10 pm. 
I feel like the same happened with animal products; I'm now really aware of how crazily they wreck up my digestion! 

Anyway, I need to get back on track so I'm buckling down today and going back to being vegan. I know it's an important thing to me for many reasons; the animals, health, human exploitation, and the environment.

The avocado industry has skyrocketed in the last 10 years, being marketed as a super food, trendy and a status symbol. 

With this boom, comes issues. Most of the US's avocados come from Mexico, where the industry has been contributing to habitat loss, climate change and loss of eco systems, as well as funding drug cartels. Who then, in turn, harass, kidnap and kill locals. 

Avocados are water hungry fruits, taking about 1000 litres of water to produce 1kg. In Chile, one of the main providers to Europe, local avocado farmers are being run out of business because they can't afford the water needed for their crops. Rivers have dried up, wells are drying up and the elite control the precious resource. I'm sure you can extrapolate what it means for the environment and human rights when the water drys up and is seen as a commodity, but those who have spoken up about it have received death threats. 

So what can you do? 

For Europe, buying the fruit from Spain ensures its traveled less, and ethically produced. 
For the US, its not that simple. Even home grown crop has its issues, because they need so much water, it contributes to the desertification of already arid states. 

Obviously, these options aren't perfect. The best you could do is decrease the amount you eat avocado, or stop altogether.

I could never feel good about being vegan if I'm going to continue using medicine, so do I stop using medicine as well? 

For stuff like the common cold and whatnot, it won't matter too much. But for serious illnesses which everyone has to face at some point in their lives, stopping medicine could mean prolonged suffering and death.

So based on that of course I don't want to stop, I don't think anyone does, but if I continued using medicine then I'd be contributing to animal exploitation which defeats the purpose of becoming vegan to begin with. 

Ultimately, human and animal life are equal, neither one is morally superior to the other. So if I get sick, then the ethical thing to do would be to let myself get sicker and die. Why should I sacrifice an animal's life to save my own? But I don't want to get sick and die, so I'm stuck.

There was a study where people bribed $1 or $20 lied to say a boring activity was interesting. The people paid $1 changed their attitude so that they actually believed the activity wasn't too boring. This study shows cognitive dissonance in action. However, the people bribed $20 didn't change their attitude. This was because they could say that it was the money that made them lie, not themselves.

We all know omnis experience cognitive dissonance which leads to my question:

i was a huge meat eater. i loved cheese and eggs. there wasnt a day, heck even a meal, without animal products. then one day, 4/8/2014, i watched earthlings and turned my nutrition upside down: fully plant based. i researched cruelty free products and avoided zoos etc. i have never felt as genuine and real and authentic.

i dont know what happened in 2018 but i completely lost myself. 

i started hurting myself again. i was completely burnt out. i started binge eating and purging. i ate until i was sick and then spent 3 to 4 hours at the gym. i compensated the pressure and anxiety with food and exercise. then i figured, i would feel sick faster if i ate the lifeless bodies of innocent animals and if i drank baby cow growth juice and if i scrambled some chicken period. so i started consuming animal products again...to hurt myself. every time i put something on my plate, i thought about the horrific process needed for this to land on my plate. it made me feel sick to my stomach. this was my new way of self harm. when my own blood wasnt enough, i needed my conscience to weigh heavily on me for having the blood of innocent animals on my hands.

after about two years of this mental torture to myself, i realized that i wasnt fine. i wasnt „just coping with thing differently“. i was hurting myself, either with the knife on my skin or with the fork on my plate. i mustered all my courage and finally admitted i needed help. i started therapy. 

a few therapists, and meds, and diagnoses, later, here i am. 

i found myself again.

the bag is almost over, in alittle over a month i think, usually the dog food lasts them a lot longer tho.

Anyway my dad already got another bag of it, i think i should probably have it returned, i wish i could find natural balance vegan dog food.

Hello to all you wonderful green people of [r/vegan](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan)

First of all I want to say three crucial things:

\#1 From the bottom of my heart, thank you for choosing compassion over fear and suffering. This is the most important thing we as vegans need to remember and remind ourselves each and every day if we are to live at peace with the fact that we are vegan in a non-vegan. 

\#2 I hope to make it as straightforward as possible that my intention of writing this post is not about an egotistical gathering of attention to and around me and my work. Let me be the first to say that the most critical voice that I will ever hear about what I do is my own voice. This post is because I'd like to stretch a hand of compassion and offer an opportunity to those who resonate with me. This project of mine has been a considerable source of personal growth, and I'd like to try at least to inspire someone to join me. I'm doing this because this is what I would have liked to see more of in my own ideal world.

\#3 I hope to clarify that I don't sell anything, nor that I am going to. This post is not about trying to get people to WATCH my content. It's about asking WHAT the vegan community would like to see and hear more of. 

For the animals, together we stand strong!

\---Abstract/TLDR---

What kind of content would you, yourself, have wanted to see produced on YouTube? 

Is there anything I can help you with to make you start producing your own videos on YouTube? 

Are there any specific topics, questions, or things I can make to help people be inspired to become vegan or make vegans be inspired to become active for the animals? 

Is there any suffering (vystopia) which people struggle with, and I can help alleviate through inspiring videos and content on YouTube or otherwise? 

Any other questions, information, contact info about me, or anything else, please leave a comment. It would mean the whole world to me to get feedback from you.

\---lengthy post with lots of details about who I am, where I'm from, what drives me and why I do what I do follows--- 

So basically what drives, and makes me want to innovate is largely fuelled by the profound amount of energy, and gratitude I get from just the simple fact of being vegan, from just having the flame and feeling within me of the knowledge that every day that I live life, I'm sparing animals from being killed. That is what I fundamentally want to pass on to the other people of the vegan community. I really want to help alleviate the suffering people feel about how humanity is treating animals. I want to help people see and realize that we do the things we do to animals because we are unconscious. 

This is what the brand I have created since November 2020 has turned into today. 

Metta Sutta Vegan Activism:

The name ""Metta Sutta"" is inspired by a Buddhist text about the cultivation of goodwill, and it's something I really found inspiring because it's what we as vegans do towards animals.

This is what I've been doing in the vegan community the last few weeks (I've only recently started being active)

\*I've been active in Facebook comments on agricultural/vegan groups for the last month 

\*Me and my girlfriend started a podcast (Norwegian podcast) this easter - it's gotten great responses from our closest vegan friends and the community!

\*I have invested around 2000 dollars in hardware for creating high-quality videos: mirrorless camera, professional recording software, microphones, website, ads, etc...

\*Recently, I started producing videos on YouTube. This will be my primary focus from now on. I'm working intensely on upgrading the quality of those videos by working on myself, which is a major reason as to why I'm asking the community for feedback and constructive criticism.

\*Recently started a Metta Sutta Instagram where me and my girlfriend will be collecting and posting inspirational videos, quotes and all things that makes the hearts of vegans melt in joy from the love of animals.

\*Recently became active in reddit (this account is 3 days old :) )

I know me posting this may be something that I regret doing ""too soon."" Still, I would rather get some genuine feedback about my work thus far, and hopefully some guidance on where to go from now on and, hopefully, find someone that would like to connect more with me. 

From the understanding that the reason we as a human race do these things to animals stems from an unconscious state of mind, we as vegans can ourselves become liberated from the constant judging, and maybe more fully start to communicate to the meat-eaters in more effective ways? That's my highest hope, and I wish someone has some thoughts about how we can do this. I've read the book ""A Plea for the Animals"" by a Buddhist monk called Matthieu Ricard and recently listened to ""The Joyful Vegan"" by Colleen Patrick-Goudreau. I find these books highly inspiring, and I want to pass along that inspiration in video and podcast format. And what I'm hoping is that if anyone resonates with anything written here, I would like you to get to know me a little better and work together to find out how to speak our truth to the world more effectively.

I'm trying to offer to create a place, a circle of innovation and inspiration that will hopefully blossom into a beautiful space of support and clarity, and my highest wish is that you would be a part of it!

\---

A little bit more about me: I'm 22 years old, I've been vegan for 1,5 years now, and l live in Norway. When I first went vegan, I was met with so much resistance from family, friends, and the society around me, and the path from the transition to veganism to the present day, has been a really hard, but rich learning experience. What I really want to do with my work is to inspire vegans to live happily with the knowing that they are doing the right thing, as well as (hopefully) helping meat-eaters realize that choosing compassion is the right choice.

How our truth needs to be spoken is in a way that connects with those people's minds, at their stage of development, through the heart, in a way that's relatable, in my opinion. 

If anyone is interested in checking me out, I do have a website: [www.mettasutta.net](https://www.mettasutta.net/) \- although I'd like to mention that the website is not fully finished yet, it's under construction. Alternatively check out my youtube channel. I recently deleted all my videos from other channels, and reuploaded the best I've made thus far on my main channel ""Metta Sutta"". Some are English, some are Norwegian.  
[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAkJcRMcWoY2fsJBF5uXCTQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAkJcRMcWoY2fsJBF5uXCTQ)  
If there is anything particularly good or bad about my videos thus far, feedback is highly appreciated.   


I will be actively responding to whatever does (or doesn't) come out of this post. I'm a little bit giddy, and nervous, but at the same time inspired and grateful for doing this.

 TLDR for below: I basically use some facts from cowspiracy plus other bits of information I've picked up. I explain regardless of legitimacy of activism, it is the message we need to get behind.

Thing is, the post isn't getting any views and I was wondering if that site is actively supressing it. I was wondering if people can go to the site to at least just view the post, which might help it appear in peoples feeds. Here is the link:

[https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Netflix-trying-to-encourage-vegetarianism-and-veganism-Is-it-performative-activism-or-legitimate-humanitarian-efforts](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Netflix-trying-to-encourage-vegetarianism-and-veganism-Is-it-performative-activism-or-legitimate-humanitarian-efforts) 

""For someone like me, this seems like a disingenuous question. Why does it matter if its false or legitimate encouragement? The message is definitely something to get behind, considering the large devastation caused by animal agriculture. The animals themselves suffer so much.

Don’t give me crap about plants are living beings too; that’s a double whammy considering, for example, that the USA has a population of 320 million and grows enough grain for 800 million people. Most of it goes to feed livestock. All that mindless consumption and cruelty just for our taste buds. The first sentence of your ‘plant lives matter’ manifesto should be “stop the animal agriculture industry”.

Incidentally, the implications for water consumption in the US are stark. The animal agriculture industry uses around 50 trillion gallons of water annually. To put this in some kind of perspective, 5% of water is consumed by homes compared to around 55% for animal agriculture. In fact, on a global scale, animal agriculture uses up to a third of the worlds fresh water. That’s woeful when literally thousands of kids die of waterborne illnesses everyday. Also, livestock covers 45% of the worlds land mass, having the biggest impact on species extinction and habitat destruction.

Not to mention animal agriculture being responsible for 18% of greenhouse gases, more than all of our planes, train and automobiles combined. Some estimates put this at 51%, when you combine all greenhouse gases of animal agriculture and its by-products. Additionally, compared to human waste, there is 130 times more animal waste produced in the USA.

We’re deforesting the amazon, the literal lungs of our planet, to make way for soy production and livestock. Before you even think about blaming vegans for eating butt-loads of tofu, most of that soy is used as feed for the livestock. Soy for human consumption from this area only accounts for about 6% directly. So much for soy boys, when you consider who is eating the most soy indirectly.

Then the health implications of meat and dairy. Heart disease, cancer, strokes, obesity etc. The Wests health care bills, especially the USAs, are spiralling out of control. And its not all to do with an aging population. Just take a look at blue zones where they consume much less meat per capita, they have more health in their long years.

Take this anecdote as you will but I know how real this is. One of my older cousins had a bypass operation two years ago at the age of 41. He took BP pills, had sky high cholesterol and ate meat all day everyday, 21 meals a week. His favourite was a nice fatty lamb curry with a few pints of lager down the pub. He wasn’t even that overweight.

Then the climate change impact of all this… if you don’t know about this, then where have you been? You can’t refute the claims of literally thousands of expert scientists on this matter (even if a literal handful of them claim climate change is bogus.)

Okay, I can concede that maybe Netflix has a target demographic which appeals to millenials and other youngsters. After all, millennials are probably the main drivers behind the veganism ‘epidemic’. But here’s the thing, millenial or boomer, Netflix or regular programming, legit humanity or narcissistic activism… people aren’t asking the right questions and we’re running out of time. A barren wasteland cannot support a single crop, let alone billions of humans and their monstrously expensive tastes.

Hang on, this is not only a disingenuous question, its quite frankly a callous question. I feel a little sorry for the person who asked it. I can at least be a voice for the massive, mindless cruelty inflicted by human society on the animals, the planet and most idiotically… **OURSELVES.""**

I had a friend who bashed me for having chickens and eating their eggs, saying it’s cruel.

Now I am not vegan, but I wouldn’t really have an issue becoming vegan, as in I don’t have some driven need to eat meat/animal products and more often than not I don’t eat any animal products just by chance.

Anyway, I have a Vegan friend, but I don’t know his motivations or anything about being a vegan. He was a lil mad at me for having chickens and eating their eggs.

The only reason I have chickens is because my parents rescued them. (We also have a turkey who was rejected from her flock, don’t plan on eating her and she has been accepted by our chickens)

Now I stopped buying eggs because I know how horrible egg chickens are treated and instead of buying cruelty free, I just treat my chickens humanly. They have a pretty big coop with room for everyone(Even the turkey) and a pretty big run that’s safe from the animals living around my house.

I make sure to feed them with good feed and any vegetables scraps I have, I sit with them basically everyday so they aren’t startles by me entering their coop, I did name them as chicks, but as they grew up they got less and less distinct. I make sure they’re comfortable and happy.

I do take the eggs they produce and eat them and give them out to family so they also don’t have to buy eggs from mistreated chickens.

Now, a lot of vegans hate this notion because it’s still an animal product, but isn’t being a vegan more about the cruelty and less about the actual by product? 

Like I am aware that chickens eat the shells of their eggs(I’ve read mixed things on the actually inside bits), so I usually crush up the eggs shells and mix it into their feed, but I also have a bag of crushed sea shells just incase

Basically my friend said I was still harming them by just owning them, but I really do treat them as good as my dogs and if I didn’t take care of em they would have either went to someone else who might not have.

Basically I’m wondering if veganism doesn’t include eggs because of cruelty or simply because they’re an animal product. Cuz my friend seemed pretty ticked, but I’m treating them well.

I want to add a disclaimer that I’ve been vegan since December 2019 and I feel amazing. I am also an avid runner, and my vegan diet plus my exercise routine has helped me lose nearly 130 lbs. 

Because I exercise so much, I try to eat at least 100 grams of protein a day. I have recently upped my calories to 1700 and I’m considering even moving it to 1800 as I start maintenance.

I haven’t had much trouble getting to 100 grams of protein a day, but I feel like I’ve been able to do it by focusing on a few staples (tofu/soy, peanut butter powder, protein shakes) and not really eating a varied mix of fruit and veg. Most days, a banana is the only fruit I eat. I have managed to sneak in more veggies to my meals, but I could definitely eat more of a rainbow.

I guess my question is, with all my activity, am I eating enough protein, too much, or too little? I would like to vary my meals a bit more. I want to start eating oatmeal with peanut butter and banana in the mornings and not worry if the meal has a certain amount of protein. I want to start adding roasted potatoes or veggies to my dinners and again, not stress so much on if I’m hitting that 100 g mark.

These toxins are primarily caused by making fertilizer, and while I enjoy veggies and grains myself, keep in mind:

1) In the United States, just 27 percent of crop calories are consumed directly — wheat, say, or fruits and vegetables grown in California. By contrast, more than 67 percent of crops — particularly all the soy grown in the Midwest — goes to animal feed.

2) Eliminating animal agriculture would result in a 75% reduction in overall farmland use and still feed the world.

In conclusion, feeding animals, to in turn eat them, is a woefully inefficient use of our limited resources. We could massively reduce farmland by eating the crops directly ... which would in turn massively reduce the need for fertilizer ... and then we might not have to worry that our houses might get crushed by tidal wave of toxic waste! Wouldn't that be nice!

I manage to tune it out pretty well, so the annoyance of the noise is not really a concern. What I'm much more concerned about is the wellbeing of the fuckin dog, for a few reasons:

1. Dogs don't just bark all day for no reason, right? Sure some are more rowdy and hyper than others, but it lives on the third floor of a building, what does it have to bark at that it can see out the windows?
2. The dog sounds choked. The barking doesn't sound playful; it sounds more like gasping and yelping, and sometimes it quiets down for a minute and instead I hear low, slight howling, before the barking picks up again.
3. The sound always comes from the same part of the apartment. I hear it much more clearly in one room than I do elsewhere in my apartment. 
4. The people have lived here for at least 5 months, and I have NEVER ONCE seen them walking a dog outside or even taking a dog out to go to the bathroom real quick. My roommate, who hasn't been working for the last couple months and has been here a lot, has also never seen or heard any sign of the dog going outside.

I wouldn't have thought much of it until I realized those last two points. Would it seriously be possible that they're keeping the dog in one of the rooms and not taking it outside? If so, how the fuck do they deal with the dog going to the bathroom? I have no sense of smell, but my roommate said she doesn't smell anything suspicious. I just don't wanna take any rash actions. I knocked on the door upstairs and the guy answered but he spoke almost no English, I think he thought I was just telling him to keep his dog down. I don't wanna call animal control because I'm worried they will just euthanize the dog or some shit, seems like most organizations are always so quick to do that. I think my best bet is to ask the property manager if they could just go in there and take a look at things, but that might also result in animal control coming. Are there types of animal control places that I could contact that would know how to better deal with this situation? Or should I just assume the dog is okay and just leave them be?

The app is still relatively new and we only launched Jan / Feb this year so we don't have many users right now, but are growing slowly each day.

Looking at peoples feedback regarding other vegan dating apps having bad interfaces, poor design and bugs we have tried to take this onboard when creating TofuTogether. 

The app is mostly free with a few limits on swiping (5 yes swipes a day, we also think this helps reduce spamming right/ yes swipes) and feed posts (3 a day). We wish it could be entirely free but then we would have to secretly sell your data 👀 or put adverts in to sustain the costs. People you have matched with are entirely free to message.

**If you have any feedback on the app, bugs or features you'd like to see added, please let us know as we'd really love to hear.**

I can understand the benefits of vegetarianism and could one day take that route, but currently believe veganism is actually ethically counterproductive. Thats a discussion we can save for another time.  

Anyway, I was having a debate with my significant other the other day about hunting. This isn't pertaining to illegal hunting, poaching or any form of hunting that actively kills an already diminishing species. This is more in regards to sport hunting and other legal forms of hunting. My significant other is vegan. 

So, anyway, I personally feel as though hunting isn't as bad as it is made out to be. My SO felt quite the opposite. She basically stated that killing any animal under any circumstance is one of the worst things you can do. Although I do agree to some extent, I do believe that there is a lot more to take into consideration than just the death of the animal. In particular, I made the argument that sport hunting and the industry actually does bring about a lot more good than people realize. A lot of hunters pay for permits, and in some cases of big game pay thousands of dollars to kill one animal. This money is often put back into the land used for preservation purposes as well as funding security for those animals which are often poached. The documentary Trophy discusses this particularly well in my opinion. If if were not for this money put back into preservation, I believe that a lot of forgotten land would be taken advantage of by big business for development purposes. Additionally, in the case of invasive species, it can actually be beneficial to hunt those animals as to preserve the indigenous populations. My SO, however, did not feel the same way at all. She said that no matter the circumstance hunting is ethically wrong and should be looked down upon.

At this point, I decided to bring up the famous ethical trolley problem. Instead of giving her the situation using people, I instead used deers. Would it be okay to kill 1 deer if you could save 100 deers from death. She was very turnt off by this question. She first tried to say that she would not make that decision but would rather die before making it at first, until I pressed her. She eventually landed on not killing the 1 deer because she could never be the person that determines the death of an animal. I thought this was a bit of a cop out and explained to her that one would then assume that she is basically letting the other 100 deer die. She argued that it was a ridiculous scenario and not one that can be related to ethics at all. That i should not have brought up that situation when discussing animal activism. Oh well.

Anyway, my point was to say that hunting, legally, may result in the death of a few animals but at the same time it could bring money to help preserve many more animals and environments. Ultimately then, if done correctly, hunting wouldn't be so bad and instead could have positive benefits. Especially since it is already so hard to fund land preservation and hire lawyers willing to fight against big businesses for this purpose. Anyway that was a brief rundown of the discussion at hand. I know she values the opinion of this community so I am posing the question to you guys. What are your takes on hunting?

I was wondering about something...
I have been vegan for about 3 years and vegetarian for about 10. I grew up in Blowmaha Nebraska and moved to PHX about 3 years ago,  right about the time I became vegan. It was difficult but not impossible to not eat meat in the middle of beef country, but I'd say pretty much impossible to avoid things like butter and eggs in sauces and such. Much easier here in the Land of Produce :D
Anyways, I'm 6'10"" 360 lbs and I've never really been into fitness or exercise. I hate to use a cliche, but I truly don't have the time for it. I recently went to a gym with a friend of mine and I figured what the hell, I'll give it a go. Im not really in the best of shape, especially as a vegan. I feel great and my bloodwork etc are all good, but I can't seem to lose any weight. Too many grains and beans, which my system doesn't do so hot with. 
At the gym my friend had me lift weights with him. He said we could do reps to figure out the max rather than overdoing it and likely causing an injury. I maxed benchpress at 375, curled 110, and legs 2000.
If I wanted to really get into this, is vegan food going to be enough calories? Like I said beans and grains don't do very well for my guts, and f&amp;v have hardly any calories. That leaves mushrooms and nuts and avocados...
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

My partner has reluctantly agreed to watch a vegan documentary with me this evening, but now I'm feeling the pressure to show the perfect film. What do you think will be the most effective? 

I think it would be best to focus on the ethical arguements before going onto environmental ones in another film another time. Earthlings is the only vegan documentary I've seen, or at least was able to watch up to a certain point. The problem that I have with Earthlings is that it opens with the pets segment, which I personally find one of the most distressing parts, but my partner already agrees in adopting animals, so I'm concerned we may not make it to the segment on animals used for food, which is the main bit I want us to see. There's also the issue with the footage being older and I believe mainly from the US, which opens up for false rationalisations that the scenes are irrelevant to our situation. The other documentaries I know of are Dominion and Land of Hope and Glory, which I think would be good since it's set in the UK where we are, but I'm not sure.

Let me give you an example: I consider ""Forrest Gump"" as one of the greatest movies ever made. The story, characters and music are just phenomenal. But since I stopped eating animals, I just hate the whole Shrimp Boat arc, especially the scene where they start catching them big time. I think it is safe to assume that those were real shrimps and not just props. Would it make a difference? I mean, I had no problems killing whales in AC: Black Flag as I had no problems with killing humans there, too.

Now of course I know that this world is not vegan, the people I interact with and I rely upon aren't vegan (well most of them aren't), and most (song)writers and movie makers aren't either, and I still like their products. And I'm not really someone who needs a ""safespace"" to escape from this (not judging if someone does!), but scenes like the one I mentioned are just reminders that most people who watch them don't even consider this wrong or something.

So with that, I was lucky enough to team up with a couple of vegan co-founders to work on a new brand, which we have launched today. Introducing **Nōskin**

Let's be honest - spending a year in design and manufacturing, selecting our suppliers, and finding fabrics such as recycled Japanese denim and hemp blends does not come easy, and does not come cheap - but I truly believe our community is ready to embrace, and demand, an improvement in our clothing options - the way we have with food.

They also list, separately, ""vegan natural flavors"".  So, I called them.  

The rep I spoke to told me he was a 40 year vegan, that they were vegan certified (after watching seaspiracy, I am even more skeptical of ""certifications""), and that it was probably a misprint, and also that he would send an email to someone to figure out the mistake and correct it. 

All great, until I asked him to contact me with the particulars of his findings.  As in, what is the difference between natural flavors (read: chicken) and vegan natural flavors; and why they listed both. I am no dummy, I have been doing this for 35+ years. It is well known in the vegan community that 'natural flavors' is a massive red flag. Labeling laws are there for a reason, and companies do their best to hide information that might appear off-putting to potential consumers. And packaging isn't cheap - companies need to buy a minimum of 80,000 lots to get a small break on the printing of plastic; to not proofread ahead of time with this large of scale seems a bit off. 

So, this is where the rep seemed to get defensive: ""can you email or call me when you find out what is going on with the labeling?"" response: "" I already cleared that up.""  I pressed him a little more, and realized that he was not being cooperative and that I was wasting my time.  he cleared up that I was confused, which is bs, because the confusing label is why I called in the first place. 

I have NEVER seen labeling like this ever. There is a reason they listed flavorings twice, with 2 different headings.  I am not sure why. What are 'natural vegan flavors', ground up vegans?  the packaging says vegan, but there is no sign anywhere of an oversight body, company, or whoever declared them to be vegan. certified by whom, exactly? 

I really want to believe the rep I spoke with, but the defensive posturing and refusal to clear up the confusion - or rather write it off as "" probably a packaging mistake"" and refusing to follow up smells like trouble.  If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, is labeled like a duck, and tastes like a duck...

The [Vegan Hacktivists](https://veganhacktivists.org) are working on a reddit bot using machine learning/AI which can be called to respond to debunk certain vegan myths. 

# Hasn't this been done before? 
It has indeed! [/u/YourVeganFallacyBot was created a couple years ago]( https://reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/igyqbq/two_years_ago_i_created_the_yourveganfallacybot/) 

Sadly, this bot has gone inactive as it required the creator to manually approve all posts.

/u/animalsupportbot will use MUCH more sophisticated methods of detecting vegan myths with the aim of running completely autonomously. This bot can be summoned to respond to any vegan myth you see on reddit, drastically reducing the time vegans take to respond to run of the mill arguments.

# We need your help! 
## Labelling 
Although the bot is in a semi-working state right now with no training data, we really want this bot to perform better, and to do that, we need some reddit comments to be labelled. We've scraped around 18k comments from /r/antivegan and /r/exvegans and put them in a [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NDue0zd00dYg0uaygXieDAJqFan4h1rSrNidQKQVz8A/edit#gid=0) for us to collaboratively label. For each comment in the spreadsheet, we'd like you to pick the myth that it belongs to, along with picking out the key sentence that the bot should be picking up on in response to that argument. 

[Please watch this short and simple instructional video before you begin!](https://streamable.com/qgjs59) 

In most cases, the comments will be ""N/A"", but for the ones which do fit into the categories listed, please select  the ENTIRE relevant sentence(s) to copy into the ""Key Sentence(s)"" column. For example, if the comment is:  `I'm not sure. The problem is, how do you know plants don't feel pain too?` the key sentence should be  `The problem is, how do you know plants don't feel pain too?`   (Note that this includes the pre-amble `The problem is`) 

## Arguments/Responses
If you think the bot should really be responding to a myth/argument which isn't present in the line-up we have currently, please post here for suggestions! If you're willing to write responses too, that would also be a great help. 

# Can I test it out now? 
Yes! You can check and test out how well it's working right now in the test subreddit [/r/testanimalsupportbot](https://reddit.com/r/testanimalsupportbot/).  It will respond to any comment in this subreddit when called, so feel free to play around with it! It's good to bear in mind that this is an extremely early prototype with essentially no training data, so expect some strange behaviour. (Note: Currently it only responds to comments, not top level text posts.) 

# How does animalsupportbot work? 
This is still an area which we have a good deal of flexibility in, but right now, it uses pretrained semantic embeddings generated from a neural network. If that term doesn't mean much to you, essentially a neural network calculates a vector which summarises any input text, such as a sentence from a comment.  We then compare this vector representation of the input text to every argument that we can respond to. If the input text and our argument are very similar, we pick out the counter argument and respond to the comment. TL;DR - Machine Learning Magic âœ¨ðŸ¤–âœ¨ 

# What arguments can it respond to? 
Currently it can respond to 30 vegan argument/myths outlined by everyone's favourite internet Vegan activist [Earthling Ed](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVRrGAcUc7cblUzOhI1KfFg) (and the responses are taken from his book/[vegancheatsheet.org](https://vegancheatsheet.org/)):

The [Vegan Hacktivists](https://veganhacktivists.org) are working on a reddit bot using machine learning/AI which can be called to respond to debunk certain vegan myths. 

# Hasn't this been done before? 
It has indeed! [/u/YourVeganFallacyBot was created a couple years ago]( https://reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/igyqbq/two_years_ago_i_created_the_yourveganfallacybot/) 

Sadly, this bot has gone inactive as it required the creator to manually approve all posts.

/u/animalsupportbot will use MUCH more sophisticated methods of detecting vegan myths with the aim of running completely autonomously. This bot can be summoned to respond to any vegan myth you see on reddit, drastically reducing the time vegans take to respond to run of the mill arguments.

# We need your help! 
## Labelling 
Although the bot is in a semi-working state right now with no training data, we really want this bot to perform better, and to do that, we need some reddit comments to be labelled. We've scraped around 18k comments from /r/antivegan and /r/exvegans and put them in a [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NDue0zd00dYg0uaygXieDAJqFan4h1rSrNidQKQVz8A/edit#gid=0) for us to collaboratively label. For each comment in the spreadsheet, we'd like you to pick the myth that it belongs to, along with picking out the key sentence that the bot should be picking up on in response to that argument. 

[Please watch this short and simple instructional video before you begin!](https://streamable.com/qgjs59) 

In most cases, the comments will be ""N/A"", but for the ones which do fit into the categories listed, please select  the ENTIRE relevant sentence(s) to copy into the ""Key Sentence(s)"" column. For example, if the comment is:  `I'm not sure. The problem is, how do you know plants don't feel pain too?` the key sentence should be  `The problem is, how do you know plants don't feel pain too?`   (Note that this includes the pre-amble `The problem is`) 

## Arguments/Responses
If you think the bot should really be responding to a myth/argument which isn't present in the line-up we have currently, please post here for suggestions! If you're willing to write responses too, that would also be a great help. 

# Can I test it out now? 
Yes! You can check and test out how well it's working right now in the test subreddit [/r/testanimalsupportbot](https://reddit.com/r/testanimalsupportbot/).  It will respond to any comment in this subreddit when called, so feel free to play around with it! It's good to bear in mind that this is an extremely early prototype with essentially no training data, so expect some strange behaviour. (Note: Currently it only responds to comments, not top level text posts.) 

# How does animalsupportbot work? 
This is still an area which we have a good deal of flexibility in, but right now, it uses pretrained semantic embeddings generated from a neural network. If that term doesn't mean much to you, essentially a neural network calculates a vector which summarises any input text, such as a sentence from a comment.  We then compare this vector representation of the input text to every argument that we can respond to. If the input text and our argument are very similar, we pick out the counter argument and respond to the comment. TL;DR - Machine Learning Magic âœ¨ðŸ¤–âœ¨ 

# What arguments can it respond to? 
Currently it can respond to 30 vegan argument/myths outlined by everyone's favourite internet Vegan activist [Earthling Ed](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVRrGAcUc7cblUzOhI1KfFg) (and the responses are taken from his book/[vegancheatsheet.org](https://vegancheatsheet.org/)):

People post pictures of graphic depictions of NH animal abuse without any sort of tag or filter.  These images are triggering in nature, and while they have a place to be shown, should be enforced as having to be tagged as NSFW.

I'd go so far as to say that it is actually speciesist for us to not treat the victims in these images with the same respect that we would a human. When the image of a human is graphic, we acknowledge the graphic, triggering, and disturbing nature of the image by tagging it as NSFW. When we post the same images towards NH animal abuse, however, we often leave

Now some may say that one could just look at another sub and leave this one, but its written well in the rules, under ""nonvegan posts"":

&gt; Do not under any circumstances post content, such as recipes, food pictures, news, cross-posts, and so forth, which include, glorify **or display the result of animal abuse, exploitation or cruelty**. This may result in an immediate ban and posts will be removed. 

I acknowledge fully that this rule exists, but I feel like it is being reinterpreted based off of the bias that if the image is technically ""pro vegan"", or if the images are somehow spun in a ""pro vegan"" way, then its seen as okay.  It really isn't, especially when you're dealing with such triggering content that often goes untagged and unflaired.

If I'm going to bring up a problem, I like to propose solutions to go along with it, so these are mine:

* Make the rule regarding this content its own rule, rather than falling under the category of ""no nonvegan posts"". This would allow us to report with the correct context, especially because a post can technically be pro vegan yet still break the rules.
* Specify in greater detail what is considered by the mods to be ""graphic images"", and under what context are they or are they not accepted, and how they are to be responsibly posted.

I'm not saying this is exactly what has to be done. I just want to start the conversation.

So I've been having moral conflicts and it's really bothering me. (Disclaimer: I became vegan for the animals, and I am, in no way, claiming to be a victim. They are the victims, only them. I am simply making my point and asking for help on the matter, because I am seriously at a loss.) I now look at meat completely different (it's just flesh from an animal that lived a very short and horrendous life). But when it comes to dairy and eggs, I cannot seem to look at them the same way. Now, before you scream at me, I am fully aware of the horrors behind the dairy and egg industry, and I am in no way justifying what happens to these animals who deserve a fulfilled life— eggs and milk are unethical period, no matter how it's done.) What I am saying is that, though I oppose animal use of any kind, especially dairy, egg, and flesh industries, I find myself still being inconsistent. I don't like it. I just never see the mother getting her baby taken away everytime I see there's milk in a product; maybe it is because I am a selfish human being. I do not drink milk nor eggs, but sometimes I get lazy and I don't bother to check ingredients, or I eat it anyway even when I KNOW it has these products. Please, as I said, I want to change and be more proactive for the animals, hate comments are not going to help. It would really help if someone could give me some insight before you start saying, ""Oh, well you're not a vegan then — you're plant-based."" I am not ""plant-based,"" and I want these animals free just as much as anyone else. But I find it hard to stay committed because I am just lazy and, as I said, I do not feel the remorse as I do with meat, and even real eggs, and real milk. It seems likes it's an effort and selfishness issue on my part. Please tell me SOMEONE has got to relate to this at least a little bit. I know I love these animals, so why am I doing this?

The same way some Muslims consider certain things halal and others arent.  


Many of us are required to do certain things that we would not be required to do if it was against our religious views. This is the simplest thing for many of us to do now. Its not lying if we become followers and simply dont do anything else the religion requires. Muslims consume alcohol but they are still Muslim, Catholics have relations despite not being married but they still Catholic, so if we become Jain, etc; and simply dont follow all the rules we can still identify as Jain.  


This would help people in prison, military, educational facilities where we are required to do experiments in order to pass classes, jobs that have us do unethical things etc;

For those unfamiliar, he discusses a variety of topics, notably theology and philosophy, but touches on veganism quite often as well. 

It’s fair to say that until recently, I never really gave the concept of veganism much thought, as most people do, or rather *don’t* do, I suppose. To get straight to the point, I’m experiencing some personal struggle in this regard. I’m sure many of you have experienced the same. I guess I’m seeking some guidance in my direction from here. 

I think there’s strong case to be made for veganism on moral grounds in regards to the suffering of animals; notably, I have a problem with the current state of the food industry. This is largely propagated by a life changing awakening I’ve had in recent months, that paints a much bigger picture. I won’t go into too much detail on that for now since it’s not 100% applicable, but briefly: I am experiencing a growing resentment for the total reliance on the modern system we’ve been set up to live by, and only by it (that being big industries and corporations). This includes, especially, the food industry.

So on the topic of the meat industry, our population numbers have increased so much in recent centuries that we no longer have a need to hunt for food. We breed and manufacture animals for the sole purpose of eating them, and often times these facilities lack proper oversight, you’ve seen the videos of the undercover investigations. It’s horrific. It’s unnatural. 

So where do I stand in all of this? I feel a growing guilt for consuming manufactured meat. I could simply stop eating it, but it’s difficult to do when I’m surrounded by people who do eat manufactured meat and have zero problem with it. As it stands, I recognize our omnivorous nature, and I recognize the natural state of the world. There’s always going to be an impersonal, uncaring, necessary balance between predator and prey. That said, I don’t think I would have a problem with consuming meat, so long as I am the one that hunts, and does so correctly so as to not cause any undue suffering to an animal. I also don’t see a problem in utilizing an animal’s resources as long as they don’t suffer in the process. 

This is a process, so please don’t bash me for holding these opinions. It’s why I’m here, to seek knowledge, understanding, to think things all the way through, free of fallacy, and most importantly, to be the best version of myself I can be.

We'll cut straight to the chase here. I recently accepted a new job (I am a bartender) at a bar which has been absolutely great, although the building is rather old. Why that's worth bringing up is because it allows the entry of at least several mice. You can probably imagine the attitude towards them harboured by the nonvegan management (who are honestly good people, just not ones who happen to be vegan).   


I am vegan myself and love animals. But, I am also aware of the sanitation issues they present in this case, which are made even more pressing in an environment such as a restaurant or bar, so I am really torn on this one. 

&amp;#x200B;

The management has set up traps around the place, which is painful enough for me to see, but my biggest point of contention is that they are using glue traps to get the poor little guys who just wanted to come in from the cold and eat some pub food (don't we all?). I am sure I don't need to tell you how horribly and gratuitously cruel those things are.   


I am just wondering, as a vegan, what is the course of action I should take that best balances practicality and compassion? I know welfarism is seen by many vegans as a tepid half measure against animal suffering, which I have nuanced feelings about, but maybe I could at least get them to use a quicker acting trap, or ideally something much much much more humane in place of that horrendous way to die. Only catch is, nobody else there is vegan, and we all know how much people traditionally sympathise with mice (or the idea of doing anything a vegan says), so I feel like this will be an uphill climb. Furthermore, I am, as I said, very new at my job, and I must admit I would ideally like to evade being labelled as 'that guy' who gets a new job and then feels entitled to tell the management how to run their business.

It's mind fucking blowing that these few types of meats are the center of all recipes when there are thousands of ingredients out there to take your food to the next level.

Honestly if everyone knew about plant based food around the world they wouldn't even touch meat anymore.

Even if I didn't care about the animals, the environment and I still consumed meat I would be lying and delusional to think that meat is just better/too good to give up.

As  you may know, Bill C-205, Canada's federal ag-gag law, has passed  second reading in the house of commons with the support of the Conservatives and the NDP. On its face, Bill C-205 looks like an   attempt to prevent disease on farms, but don't be fooled—this dangerous  bill targets animal advocates who go on farms without permission, but  lets farmers off the hook for creating disease risks. Steep penalties include massive fines and even jail time for animal advocates. This is a  tactic that conservatives use worldwide- make already illegal things  illegal-er, with a view to demonizing animal rights advocates, and  punishing and deterring animal rights activism.

However, it hasn't passed third reading yet, so it isn't law. There's still time to stop this nonsense.

Here's  how you can help if you are a Canadian: Animal Justice has made an  online tool that makes it easy to send an e-mail to your MP. Check it  out here: [https://action.animaljustice.ca/page/78832/action/1](https://action.animaljustice.ca/page/78832/action/1)

While  it is important to let your MP know that you don't want this bill  passed, this is particularly important if you live in an NDP riding.

But I worry about the ingredients in like the tortillas and the refried beans. How do y'all handle this?

I came to the US from Bangladesh as an international student. I am currently in my senior year and would be graduating in about a month. My university is in small town in the South where, being a predominantly conservative state, my only viable options to shop for grocery are Walmart and Kroger. There are no vegan restaurants around me either. I live with 3 roommates who are all meat eaters, and we often buy common food items together (like buying a 20 lbs bag of rice and sharing it between us). Also, although this may go without saying, I'm hella broke. 

Now, I have recently watched a couple documentaries on the ethical, health and environmental aspect of animal agriculture, and I am completely convinced that I want to go vegan. I am not overly health conscious. However, I think I would like to make nutritional completeness a goal in my transition to veganism. The purpose of this post is to get some help from any of you, if possible, with some roadblocks: 

1. I have a taste preference for my traditional foods. Think Indian veg food with the addition of small portions of fish (which is mostly added for flavor as well as protein) and other non-veg Indian items like chicken Tikka masala and such. I'm considering replacing the fish in the traditional vegetable dishes with some other kind of protein that's relatively cheap (maybe adds some flavor too?). What would be some of my options? 
2. I watched some videos suggesting that I buy legumes, nuts, beans and whole grain from whole food stores where I can get the exact amount I need. Having no whole food stores near me, what would be my option to include these ingredients in my food? 
3. What are some good vegan snacks that would be comparable to hot Cheetos, or Lay's kettle-cooked jalapeno chips? Are there any popular brand name chips that are vegan? 
4. Please also include any tips, if you have any, to save money on grocery trips.

For me, I haven't gotten the virus but I did get my gallbladder taken out; and since then, it's been hard to eat anything unhealthy; everytime I eat cheese, milk, more than a dash of oil or butter, etc. I feel pain or very uncomfortable. I decided to eat plant based/vegan (though I'm not putting a label on it yet) and reinvent foods I used to be able to eat, and find healthy alternatives as well as just eating fruits and vegetables and stuff. It's literally the only way I've been able to eat. And for some reason once I started eating a lot more vegan/whole foods, real meat has just...been unappealing to me. Though from my memory it hasn't caused pain. 

Now, I've done this before, just not at this scale. Before when I went whole plant based, I would literally just eat vegetables and fruit, just in...bowls. Stir fry. That's it, that was as far as the cooking or creativity went, which made it very boring. Back then I was also anemic so after a while I also got fatigued.

Who are you a vegan for? Other people or animals? I bet if animals could understand that, they would not mind you constantly talking about the abuse they have endure on a daily basis.
The only reason why an omni would say ""she's not like most vegans, she's not annoying af"" about you is if you DON'T TALK ABOUT VEGANISM.

In March I've decided to do 30 days of Plant Based diet. I cut out almost all meat and dairy products and embarked on a journey of tasty and colorful food. I'm continuing to stick to my diet as of today as I find benefits in PB diet.

Together with my journey, I've monitored my weight. On February 28th I was weighted 66.8kg, today me weight is 63.6kg. I've lost more than 3kg in a month+ and I'm starting to worry.

I wasn't a heavy meat eater before that and I rarely ate dairy products. On the other hand, before March, I can't remember when was the last time I've ate beans or peas. I tried to do calorie counting for some time and I'm not under eating. I can reach 2200+ calories a day and I rarely feel hungry, so I don't think that I'm under nourished.

However, this sudden weight drop bothers me from health perspective. I **suspect** it might be related to the fact that I did sort of drastic diet change and it takes the body some time to adjust, but I'm wondering if someone else experienced similar symptoms.

Thank you for your time.

I've been vegan for 6 years. I had always said the food is the easiest part, what's challenging of being vegan is other people. I've been mocked, insulted and judged, people had called me names, even friends and family. And mind you, I've never been agressive or ""pushy"" or anything, I believe ""forcing"" people doesn't work because people have to make the connection themselves in order to have a permanent and genuine change, but I speak about my convictions if asked. People always feel attacked so for a time I just smiled and keep my thoughts for myself (not anymore, but that's another topic).

Anyways. I've had a couple of boyfriends through that time. One was abusive and used to mock me, and the other one tried to ""comply"" with the ""issue"" and it felt it (I) was an inconvinience (we sometimes went to vegan restaurants but he still ate animals when we were together, he also said he could be vegan for me in the future if we lived together, but that didn't sit right with me because I didn't want to be the reason).

Anyways, I began a new relationship on May last year. He is amazing, honestly I didn't think I could be this happy. Guys, I found the one. He's the most intelligent, the sweetest, the kindest, the funniest, the sexiest. He isn't vegan, but he respects I am and from day one, he has cooked and eaten plant based whenever we are together. I had an amazing birthday, Christmas and new years eve feast. We share recipes and experiment with food. It is great. 

For the first time in my life, I feel that I can truly be myself with someone. He listens, we often debate and try to see things from the other one's prespective. So I just share my thoughts whever I see something that angers me or frustrates me, I vent to him. And he is always there for me. 

This week he told me he started reading some things about animal rights, so I decided to give him my copy of DeGrazia's introduction to the topic (amazing book, it changed my life, I strongly recommend it). I didn't think much about it. Then today we had a picnic (with safe precautions) and I shared my thoughts on the videos of a vegan youtuber that had made me question my approach to veganism. I think I have to change the ""pick me vegan"" behaviors I sometimes have. Anyways, he listened and then he told me he hasn't consumed animals since last Tuesday. He told me he has always thought there was something wrong about  animal product-food and now that he isn't eating it, he feels a weight has been lifted off his shoulders. Although he thanked me for speaking about the topic, he isn't doing it for me, but for the right reasons, the animals. His journey has started and I feel the luckiest woman in this planet.

I always thought I couldn't be with someone in the long run if they weren't vegan. Anti-speciesism is as important for me as anti-racism or anti-sexism or anti-homophobia. Discrimination is all the same for me and being against it is a fundamental part of my identity, so I always wished for someone who shared my same values. And I found him. I'm just so happy.

I'm currently living a sedentary lifestyle so have been eating 1400 calories max the past 2 weeks and have already lost 4-5lbs! 

About 8 months ago I was getting dizzy so I started taking a multi-vitamin and have been fine since then. I tried to stop taking the multi-vitamin once and the dizziness came back so that further confirmed that I was lacking something even when I was eating a lot of calories. However, since I've been eating 1400 calories I am still taking my multi-vitamin, but now my dizziness is back. It specifically happens whenever I stand up. 

I'm using myfitnesspal and I'm not sure if it's 100% accurate, but according to it I seem to not be getting enough of several nutrients, particularly protein and iron. Seems as though I get around 25-40g of protein a day. I'm not really sure what to do as I feel like my diet is pretty healthy, so I don't know how to add more nutrients without adding more calories.

To give insight into how I usually eat:

Breakfast - fruit and nut bar

Lunch - usually some variation of a salad. Ingredients I use often include avocado, falafel, chickpeas, beans, spinach, cucumber, etc. Sometimes I'll have a lentil and vegetable soup with bread instead.

Dinner - sometimes i'll have a bean and mince  chilli with avocado, sometimes cheesy pasta with spinach, sometimes tofu and chickpea curry, sometimes a lentil cottage pie w/ veg, etc.

Snacks - I usually have 1-2 snacks a day including stuff like choc rice cakes, quinoa chips, pretzels w/ peanut butter, popcorn, yoghurt, etc.

When I look up what vegan foods are high in protein or high in iron I see all the foods that I eat every day/week so I don't understand what to do. I eat 1400 calories as this is what is recommended to me, but could this recommendation only be good if it's a omni diet? Am I meant to eat more calories as a vegan?

Anyway, I'm not allowed to talk about it with my family because they'll say, ""You can't bring up dogs, it's not the same thing! You have your opinions and we have ours."" So while they're sitting eating lamb or veal and I just don't say a word, they still don't know why I'm upset? Then they'll keep asking, ""What's bothering you? I know you! I know you're upset about something!!!"" What do you want me to answer?

If I say, ""I'm upset because of the animal abuse,"" they'll say that's just an opinion. ""You can't let yourself get upset about that, you always ruin our fun, we're just trying to celebrate and have a good time!"" I'm not allowed to be sad that you celebrate life and special occasions by killing babies? 

They've many times told me I'm not allowed to talk about it and they get mad when I do, and their answer is always the same: ""That's just your opinion! Opinions are subjective, you can't tell us how to live our lives. Live and let live. I respect your choice to be vegan, you should respect our choice not to!""

And yet, the other day I decided (in the privacy of my own home while eating in front of the couch) to lick my plate. My sister looked at me and said ""That's disgusting!"" 

So to maybe give her an idea, I said ""Well that's just your opinion! You can't tell me how to live my life. I respect your choice not to lick plates, respect my choice to do it!"" She could not believe what she heard, like I was some kind of crazy person, and said to me, **""Well SOME things are OBJECTIVELY wrong!""** 

Hmm, so violently killing a baby animal is just a subjective opinion that doesn't concern anyone but you and me, but which utensil I decide to touch with my mouth based on arbitrary social mores is ""objective""? 

It bugs me because they always tell me what to do, and say something is ""rude,"" and constantly judge everything I do. But when I even get upset and don't say a word because of systematic mass slaughter, I'm out of line and no one should ever judge. Every single thing they think is worthy of judging people for seems like *nothing* compared to the seriousness of what the meat industry is doing to the world, and yet they *laugh* making fun of vegans in mocking voices going ""mEaT iS mUrDeR HAHAHAHAHAHAHA BUNCH OF CRAZIES 😂""

Another thing that happened is when I go grocery shopping to buy vegan stuff and my mom asks me to pick up some meat or dairy. I've told her many times why I'm not comfortable doing that, and even asked her what she would do if someone asked her to go kill a dog for her, saying ""You don't have to *eat* it, it's not for *you*, don't be selfish!"" And yet nope, she still thinks I'm selfish for ""literally forcing"" my views on her. Last time I said no, she says to me, **""I understand you have your opinions and you're very passionate, but sometimes you have to put your beliefs aside and do the right thing!""**

""The right thing"" is killing baby animals, and my ""belief"" is that I don't personally like it? She doesn't realize I could say the exact same thing to her, right? Put *your* beliefs (that 5 minutes of enjoyment on your tastebuds is a good reason to kill a baby animal) aside, and do the right thing (leave them alone).

Sometimes I want to give up hope and feel useless.

My mom insists that she can’t live without meat, and that our local, organic farm is different from the big ones. She’s a bit more in denial IMO, and she just gets real quiet when I bring up the horrors.

My dad, on the other hand, isn’t in any denial, he just doesn’t care. I’ve told him what goes on, (not in an annoying way, I wanted him to understand why I was upset, not for him to stop eating meat), so it’s fair to assume he knows, he just doesn’t care. His reason for not caring is that “there’s no way to ethically feed billions of people” and “you don’t wanna know how the sausage gets made”.

I respect my dad so much and I know he’s a good person, but it bothers me that he doesn’t care. Also, he has kind of a history of viewing animals as objects, in a way. He has a fish tank and referred to cheaper fish as being “expendable”, meaning he doesn’t care if they die.

I believe in the good in people and that most people don’t care because they don’t know. But my dad knows and doesn’t care. And it upsets me. Again, I’m not trying to meddle in their lifestyle, I just don’t understand why they’re like this.

Man, it's been a journey.  I gave up meat (and always had to specify that it included poultry and fish) in 2007.  I went vegan in April of 2013, and haven't looked back.  This month marks eight years of veganism.  In the last eight years, veganism has come a long way.  I went from having a couple of insta-foods that I could buy at the local chain grocer to having an exponentially growing number of items that I seem to be able to have.  The irony, of course, is that I eat a lot healthier these days and don't buy most of the new products that are on the market on any sort of regular basis.  I do my best to try a fair few of them, though, just to see what they're like.

Just setting an example for people has gotten people thinking, and my partner completely made the transition to veganism last summer.  This movement seems to only be beginning.

**I dedicate this post to all of the vegans who were doing it before I was, paving the way to make it a hell of a lot easier for me and everyone else these days.**

When I politely called her out on it and laid down a boundary saying that it's not okay to make me the butt of jokes about my lifestyle, she gave a totally transparent BS apology saying that she ""respected"" my choices and that it was just a ""lighthearted tease"".

Let me be clear that I do not talk about my veganism unless someone else brings it up, and I have never suggested to her that I disapprove of her choice to eat meat. Literally have never, ever gone there with her. 5 years I've known her, 1 1/2 of them as a vegan.

I followed up with her privately saying that I appreciated the apology, but that there was no valid reason to tease me for not eating animals. That respect and teasing aren't compatible in my view. That as a lifelong vegetarian I've been the butt of thousands of similar jokes and that they were the source of some childhood trauma and abusive behavior by people I thought were my friends. That her words really hurt me and were confusing in the context of an otherwise positive and supportive relationship. I sent her [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/28/opinion/vegan-food.html). I told her that I hoped she could empathize and hoped that this additional context could strengthen our relationship. 

As a progressive gay feminist of color, I thought she'd be able to empathize. All I got back?

I'm honestly gobsmacked. I didn't exactly expect ""love and light"", but that curt, empty, icy 3-word reply was not on my possibility list. The fact that it came from a grown-ass woman in her late 30s. The difference between how she handled the convo in private vs in front of her family.

Obviously there is the superiority of those who do it for moral reasons and respect to them. Definitely more swayed by it lately personally but it didn’t convince me initially so I wouldn’t call myself an ethical vegan. 

So many great reasons, so much data and philosophy. There is however one group I looks down on abs honestly I dislike more and more the longer I’m vegan. “Icky” vegans. 

Oh you think meat is icky? 

It all started when you tried to cook a stake and the tissue at the bottom of the packet was dripping in blood? Hahaha yeah so funny how you only ate stake at restaurants because of that before giving it up all together.

Really liked drum sticks until you bit a blood vessel and you can’t look at chicken nuggets the same way? 

Did you know that sausage are sometimes made using pig intestines? Ewwwwww so gross that when an animal is eaten all of it at least gets fucking used rather than thrown away to rot for its suffering. Hahahah yeah right gross. 

You used to eat cheese all the time, yum how could you live without it right, none of that stinky stuff though hahaha gross mould am I right? Then one day you left you’re really expensive cheddar at the back of the fridge and part of it froze and the other part went all fuzzy after you got back from holiday. Hahah yeah it’s a lot of money to loose, can’t look at any cheese the same way anymore though right? Mould hahaha gross yeah. 

You just don’t like dairy and think it’s gross now that you know puss gets in it? That a stupid reason, it was just as puss filled when you last had it. 

You just think that killing an animal is icky, no problem with the death of its desire to live, it’s poor living conditions, is being a product, no no no just that killing is icky.

I've been vegan for two months now (vegetarian before that) and I'm encountering some problems with my omni roommates. For context: I am a university student living in a shared house with some other students. Despite our differences, we all get along well and we usually eat dinner together (we take turns cooking each day). Moving out is not an option on the short term (perhaps in a year or so, but definitely not sooner than that).

The main problem is that my roommates do not want to adjust their cooking to my dietary preferences; whereas vegetarian was not really a problem to them (I'd just get a meat substitute alongside my veggies), cooking vegan meals is something they find 'too complicated' because it requires more adjustments. I also do not feel comfortable asking them to take my relatively new dietary preferences into account, because they already mock me whenever they see me drinking non-dairy milk (""oAtS hAvE fEeLiNgS tOo"") and they constantly try to debate me, while obviously not taking my arguments seriously (which is a whole other problem on its own, really). As a consequence, I am still regularly consuming meals which do contain milk, cheese and other dairy products, something which I find increasingly uncomfortable...

If you are unfamiliar with Telegram pods, they are communities formed to increase your reach and visibility on Instagram. You will need to download Telegram app to join. While there are many other engagement pods out there, we were not able to find one with a vegan / sustainable fashion niche so we created one. Here is the link: [https://t.me/ethicalfashion\_insta](https://t.me/ethicalfashion_insta)

Note: We just launched this group so if you are one of the first couple of users to join us, please simply share the post you want engagements on.  

PS: A lot of pod admins will make it mandatory to follow their accounts which we think is a very ineffective way of growing. That being said, if you end up joining our pod &amp; choose to follow us, please feel free to DM us you are from Reddit and we will follow you back!

Is it okay ethically to not reveal you are vegan to those around you when they keep questioning it, noticing that all your “excuses” seemingly align with vegan outcomes?

In terms of health...I watched my father die of cancer. It broke me. Every time I see the animal products he consumed a lot of....I think of the agony he went through in the last stages of his life....and I can’t bring myself to bring that pain into my life again...so I immediately go for whole food plants to hopefully prevent it.

A lot of my family heavily argues cancer is just in the family line. While I disagree with them, I’m not a doctor so I don’t know how educated I am on the topic, so I stay quiet.

My father got cancer. His father got cancer. Both died in their 50s long before they should have... both the kindness members of the family... sad face.

Everyone (in former associations I had with them, when we would regularly eat together... we don’t do it anymore because of ... reasons... see profile for irrelevant explanation of that...) heavily argued non stop that my grandfathers death was genetic.

Thing is.... they eat so much god dam meat. Every meal: 
Meat: red meat; fish; chicken; or some other former sentient animals flesh.

So much bacon. Ungodly amounts of bacon. So much so, that when my loving grandmother made me a bean soup (she’s the only one who I told I was plant based. But she’s not the brightest person and never understood it, so this wasn’t intentional on her part, trust me): she put bacon in the sauce to flavor it. Thinking it was fine since it was only a bit.

Dairy: cheese, so much god dam cheese; milk; 

When I was a young child I naturally consumed The same foods, up until about 15.

Looking back, my symptoms were INSANE and really bad, such that I’m surprised I never considered the food I was eating could be causing me to have these issues.

Rashes: EVERYWHERE. For arms. Shins. Oh my god dam fingers. Bottom of my feet. It was so bad. Even when I didn’t scratch it would get worse, and when I did scratch I’d get blamed by my family for it getting to that point. “It’s only that bad because you scratch. If you stopped it would go away. (Nah it’s not the food at all). I’d wake up 3 days a week seeing blood everywhere on my bed from the scraps opening up.)

Cravings: I’d go through non stop physical shakes if I didn’t  have dairy products 3 times a week. My loving father had to limit My ice cream consumption to 3 days a week because I was ballooning up. But i was always trying... my best.. I swear... but the cravings kept getting more and more intense until I gave in.

Depression and fatigue. NON STOP FATIGUE. I’d be told by family that I just wasn’t eating enough, them proudly patting their ballooned stomach. I forced myself to eat more of the garbage food. I definitely ate more, but my fatigue got worse and I gained weight 


All of this is to just show.. how sick and tired I was of my health feeling like garbage. So I stoped. I told family My decision to just limit (l said lying, knowing i wasn’t eating any behind closed doors) animal products. So please , if they cook, just give me the non animal based parts of the meal.  I’d be more than happy to bring my own food if the entire meal is animal based tho, they had to do NOTHING extra.

First: they asked why. I explained that I was trying to see if changing my diet could help my symptoms. They told me I was being silly, it wasn’t the food. And that I needed to keep eating these health calorie dense foods, it’s in our DNA!

Second: when the above strategy did not work, and it became clear that for about 2 months I had not gave up (skin improving before their eyes. But they ignored that, claiming I was just not scratching... I was still scratching a lot. They didn’t believe me). They tried a new strategy: guilt tripping me.

They told me I could 100% “cheat” 1 day a week and my health would be fine. When I told them “cheating requires me to want to eat those foods because it brings pleasure, and I don’t get pleasure from the side effects I do still get after eating it, so I don’t “cheat” with foods that cause pain... they god mad.

“Oh. So your grandmother slaves over a stove and you are going to be disrespectful and not eat it? Wow.”

“No. I do eat the food she makes. See, I’m right now eating plain pasta. L

“It’s rude to not eat everything. You are insinuating she’s doing a bad job and making you sick. That’s rude”

“What? No, I’m just trying to figure out symptoms by isolating my diet to foods that work. And if I add something in it will show me if my reaction is negative. “

“I disagree. It’s rude. “

“(Seeing no other way out, I lied) my doctor told me to do this. Are you telling me I should ignore my doctor? “

This shut down all complaints. Once I tied it into “my doctor told me to do this”, they had a difficult time arguing back that I’m being rude. Although they did try, and the sane people at the table would go 

“dude. Does OP tell you to stop taking your anti acid pills your doctor recommended? “

“That’s not the same thing. This is food not medication.”

“I specifically heard you tell me your doctor told YOU not to eat X food groups and you wouldn’t need to take the anti acid pills. So unless you want us to judge YOU for ignoring doctors orders, leave op alone” (GO. GRANDMA. LOVE YOU. SO MUCH... even if you put bacon in my food without understanding why it was bad. But you stopped when I asked you not to, so we gucchi).

So....I know that was a long rant. But. My point: when I lie about being vegan to the awful people in my family, or awful people in general... it solves so many problems and allows me to live my life. I don’t want to be an activist right now given how bad and abusive my family was growing up. But, is lying unethical, and contributing to the problem even more, and I should be willing to take the hostility ?

When my family suspected I’d become vegan, the anger was INSANE. They literally told me I was lying to do them for X, Y, and Z reasons. They went off on how I was judging them for their choices and I needed to stop bullying them and just eat the dam food. And until I finally lied, telling them it was my doctors advice.... they kept getting worse.

Now. I am away from those family members now. But.... I just dont think I can handle the hostility associated with activism. But I can not contribute to the problem.

My question is for folks who actively supplement with iron. I’ve been vegan for about 7 years and mainly vegetarian for many years before that. Recently, after experiencing a myriad of symptoms, I discovered I had low ferritin (26), where anything under 30 is an absolute iron deficiency. 

Admittedly I wasn’t consuming as many green vegetables nor beans, but I was always eating sufficient amounts of tofu. 

So! For those of you who are aware of your iron levels and are consciously trying to raise them or simply maintain them; what supplement do you take? 

I’ve been taking Spatone but it’s a measly 5mg so that likely won’t help me much. Thus I’m in the market for a vegan friendly iron that won’t overload me but be something I can take consistently and sustainably.

The problem is, that his behaviour strains his relationship with our family and others. He always asks me ""when will you go fully vegan?"" and any effort shown is not enough for him. If there's a vegan option for him, it's not enough, cause the whole table should be vegan. 
A couple of weeks ago, my parents went to visit him in his flat. They brought homemade pizza and when he realised, that some pieces my parents ate had cheese on them (the plantbased cheese had run out), he kicked them out. ""There will be no slavery under my roof"". 

Now, our Easter brunch is supposed to be tomorrow. He told us he won't be attending, as long as there is a single animal product on the table. And it's not like there will be a Suckling pig or anything, it's just about a couple of eggs and some mayonnaise.

so i’ve been vegetarian for about 7 years then vegan since about august last year, and my sister turned straight to vegan in about november/ december. the rest of my family are meat eaters which obviously i don’t agree with so it was really nice having another vegan in the family, so whenever the topic would come up and i would speak about how the meat/ animal product industry is literally killing the planet (as well as it being unhealthy for your body) i’d have someone to completely back me up so i didn’t sound like a preachy dick while the rest of my family rolled their eyes, it was great. The problem now is that she’s saying that she doesn’t really have any interest in being vegan anymore and that when the UK lockdown is over in a couple months she’s almost definitely going to go vegetarian because when she’s out and about with friends and stuff her options are way too limited and she probably wouldn’t be able to find food, and idk i think it’s kind of bullshit. it seems like such a tiny problem that could be really easily solved by either making your own food and bringing it out (a bit of a hassle i know) or just going with something you don’t want to eat as much as a non-vegan option but you’ll make do because it’s still good food.it’s also that she says she PROBABLY won’t be able to find food, she doesn’t even know for sure... i feel like i shouldn’t be so personally upset by this, especially because i don’t feel this annoyed about my family eating meat? but if feels like a real bummer and almost a betrayal?? cause she seemed so passionate about the ethics and wellbeing of animals being very anti-cruelty and pro-not-killing-the-environment and now she’s like “ah fuck it life is easier for little old me when i don’t always have to only eat plant based” and it feels like she thinks her convenience is more important that the literal lives of animals and that it seems to go back on the values she’s seemed to have since turning vegan :( i’m probably overreacting i’m just really worked up about it especially because i don’t want to bring it up with her for fear of sounding like a proper asshole/ like i’m controlling her so i’m just bottling it up i guess??

Baked ziti: boil some pasta noodles. In a bowl, take some tofu and mash it up. Add some nutritional yeast, some salt, oregano or and basil. When the pasta is ready, place it in a over safe dish, put marinara sauce on top and then put the tofu on top of that. Put tin foil and place in oven. 

French bread pizza: do the same thing with the tofu. Cut the baguette in half, put pizza sauce or marinara sauce on first, then the tofu. Add your favorite toppings

Chickpea tacos: dice some onion and or cucumber. Take the chickpeas and mash them together with the onion and or cucumber. Add chili seasoning, and any other Mexican type seasoning you like. Place in the over just to toast it. I like to toast my tacos a little too! Add some lime!

Chickpea (tuna fish) sandwich: in place of tuna, I use chickpeas. I like to toast, so same as above but once the chickpeas and onions are toasted, mix it with vegan Mayo in a bowl. Then make your sandwiches

Pesto: spinach, basil, nutritional yeast, walnuts -
Blend and can be used as a dip or on any type of pasta noodles. Add tofu too!

Black beans or pinto beans on rice, sometimes I put it on brown rice or quinoa. No explanation. Add potatoes!

Middle Eastern Bowl: chickpeas (or green lentils)  on couscous or rice or quinoa. Add humus and any veggies you like. I also add sweet potatoes or potatoes 

Peanut butter and banana sandwich: self explanatory. I put it on whole wheat toast 

Green lentils on quinoa or couscous: I boil some water, add some salt and then when it boils, I add the lentil, cover and turn down to low and let it sit for 30 minutes. So simple, one of my favs.

Hello, I am newish to the concept of veganism (been learning about it for only 3 years) and I have been considering going vegan for some time now. I overall agree with the sentiment that animal lives have intrinsic value and the fact that 8% of the population is vegan is enough to convince me to participate. I believe that if that number continues to grow, the animal agriculture industry will die out or become obscure and as a communist, all exploitation is bad, including towards animals.

While I don’t particularly like animals, I recognize that they are Living for beings who experience pain, love and deserve a life beyond being used for consumption.  

However, I have autism, and I am an extremely picky eater.

When I say picky, I am not just talking about textures, I haven’t eaten a piece of fruit since I was in elementary school and most vegetables make me gag. I also can barley stomach salads and you couldn’t even pay me to eat that kind of stuff. There are very few textures I Can actually tolerate and a lot of vegan recipes admittedly kind of look like dogshit. 

I would have no problem actually cutting out stuff like meat (I hate the taste of milk and yogurt so I don’t eat those, but I do eat a lot of cheese). But finding healthy substitutes to those things is the difficult part—especially since I live in an area that doesn’t really have many supermarkets, yet alone vegan options. 

Seafood would also be a big problem for me since it’s one of the only proteins/sources of B-12 I get and I am going to be honest, I really like seafood. I also really love cheese and seafood and cheese are stuff that even from some vegans, say that the vegan replacements don’t taste good. 

One saving factor would be the fact I am obsessed with mushrooms and I could easily cut out all meat and replace it with mushrooms, but mushrooms alone doesn’t make up a balanced diet. 

This has just been circling my mind a lot and I don’t know if anyone is going to notice this, but yeah.",True,False,False,vegan,t5_2qhpm,585127,public,self,Considering going vegan...but I am neurodivergent,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/mixd18/considering_going_veganbut_i_am_neurodivergent/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm a 16(F) and I'm very concerned about my health at the moment. I went vegan about a year ago (only for the animals), and ever since then, my food choices have just plummeted. That's not to say a non-vegan diet is inherently good for you, but when I wasn't vegan, I was given much more support, and thus, much more options. My family does support me somewhat (they are not vegan), and they buy me things like tofu, vegan snacks, and even got me a whole bunch of vegan stuff for my b-day. However, because they're not vegan (and because the world is generally non-vegan), I never really properly learned how to make anything that doesn't contain rotting corpses in it. I don't know how to cook a lot of vegan dishes, and I struggle to find recipes online that can cater to my living situation right now (my parents only buying vegan products they can afford). I also want to try and abstain from plant-based ""meats"" and other products like that; I want to cook real vegan meals, because I just think they taste better. My go-tos in the past have usually been things like white/brown rice with different veggies, depending on what we have. But in contrast, I eat a ton of processed junk throughout the day, like chips, soda, candy. And by the time dinner comes around, it's usually another gigantic load of sodium or processed, easy-to-make meals. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I am quite young for my age, but I assure you I am well over my years mentally. I care deeply for the environment, animals, and my body. I went vegetarian (which I know is not the same) about a year ago, but unfortunately had to go back to eating chicken (please don’t hate me, my mom and doctor both said I needed more protein) because I got very ill due to being malnourished. I wasn’t getting enough protein in my diet, despite eating lentils, beans, nuts, and other things. I even opted for some vegan patties, nuggets, pizza, and other things while being vegetarian. I absolutely HATED eating any thing with a beating heart. I still do. I feel guilty every time I eat chicken or any other meat. 

My mom supports me through everything, so if I told her I wanted to go vegan, she wouldn’t mind, I would just have to do intense research to make sure I don’t become malnourished again. The only issue is, my entire family eats meat... so whenever I have dieted, exercised, or even when I was vegetarian, I was the only one in my household. It was hard at first, but I just stopped craving meat and such. It is hard to do’s nothing remotely different when you’re in a house with people who don’t care about the meat industry and stuff. I guess they just aren’t as educated as I am. 

I really have a hard time finding foods I like. Or foods that are good. Or being full enough. I don’t want that to happen, because we all know that being hungry sucks.

A person could go vegan today and still millions of animals will be killed tomorrow because everyone else isn't vegan. So what I mean is, attacking their methods directly.

Vegans could address their methods with the purpose of forcing a change to alternative methods that meet a supposed humane criteria. A method that is used to, theortically bring suffering and torture to zero if not the bare minimum. For starters its known that the methods they currently use are optimized for mass production, not for the regard of animals at all..
If these methods are approached with the sense of bettering the production instead of shutting it down (which is also the ultimate goal.) .. This will impact production value. As most ways to mass kill for demand won't meet the bare minimum of suffering criteria that has been set.

This should get support as most people don't support the suffering and torture of animals. So if a petition is started perhaps signatures would be bountiful if that reason is expressed for changes in regulation.

If it goes as expected, the prices of meat will rise due to new regulations of more attentive killings of animals. More attentive meaning more time consuming, less is being able to be produced.. The only option to compensate is hire more people, which eats away at the businesses money. The only way to compensate THAT is higher the prices. 
With prices going up, less people will buy or be able to buy, which would effectively put a dent in production value would it not?

This also ties into the forceful impregnation of animals. If you could prove in court that it is no different from the rape of a real animals by human hands (which is already illegal). You could forcibly change regulation to only have breedings done naturally. 
If the animals are being stressed out constantly and tortured, the last thing they are going to want to do is breed. That would indefinitely slow down production and make meat a rarity. Something not a lot of people could buy.

I am new to veganism (made it my new year's resolution to be vegan by the end of the year, and I've made great peogress) but was a vegetarian for a lot of my teen years, whenever it was possible. My adoptive family, despite frequently using meat substitutes in their food, would ridicule me in public, with their friends, and at restauraunts for not wanting to eat meat. You probably have heard it, joking about forcing you to eat meat, tricking you, etc. I have dealt with previous mistreatment (hence why I was adopted) and basically just... Gave up until I ran off as an adult.

This, and the way veganism is so often openly mocked by others online, makes me really nervous to be in this situation if I ever mention my diet. I don't want to react poorly to someone and just be another person reinforcing the idea that veganism isnt something to take seriously. You're all probably much better equipped to handle these situations, please tell me what your strategies are. I want to be openly vegan someday once I'm actually 100% there. I want to be an advocate.

I’m reading vegan news and saw about Joaquin Phoenix and Rooney Mara helping with donating vegan meals to the LGBTQ+ community (shared last night if you’re interested!) and felt super moved. I just finally went fully vegan last month after being vegetarian since the end of 2018. I want to do more.

I feel damn good about this! 

Anyway, as I was thinking about all of this, I realized, I live in South Carolina, a huge region for fishing, barbecue, etc. and know one person who is a vegetarian. I’m wondering if there’s like, a site where I can find vegans near me? I would just love that fellowship because I feel so alone in my area. I’m also not working, 27F, and live basically off an old golf course surrounded by very rich people with nothing but time, so that also makes me feel more alone in this effort.

Honor Culture is the concept that you have to defend your position and reputation above all, with dire social consequences if you don’t. It traps you in a cycle of violence and being unable to admit when you are wrong. 

Examples ranged from the loss of the World Cup by France after the Italian star player called the French captain’s sister a whore (and he head butted him and was ejected from the game) to the examples in movies and media, so on. 

Everything I was hearing tracked with meat eaters being part of this example of honor culture. Inability to admit it’s wrong. Reacting violently with actions or words when confronted by the unpleasant truths.

Nellie/ Amla is found naturally in tropical and subtropical South Asian arid regions and mixed evergreen forests. It originates in the southern Himalayas of Nepal, from the northern part of India to the southern part of the Indian subcontinent. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Medicinal properties 

 Ayurveda points out that Nellie contains all the flavors except salt. It contains the five flavors of sweet, acid, thorn, bitter and decoction. Nellie can be described as an equally beneficial medicine to alleviate the triads of va, pit and sem. 

 Nellie is also very good for pregnant mothers and helps to get rid of many complications during pregnancy. 

Nellie helps maintain normal levels of hormones in the liver, restores liver cells, controls cancer and inflammation, and maintains proper function throughout the body. Nellie is a good medicine to prevent allergies, improve body strength and strengthen the pulse, develop intelligence and control aging. Nellie is also good for dental disease.

Both my parents immediately said what a horrible idea it is. But they followed that up by saying “but we totally support you.”

I started off by talking about the footage I’d seen and how it disturbed me. My dad said how that sort of thing was propaganda and designed to provoke a reaction, and he doesn’t wanna see me get “manipulated” by it. I said that if reality was provocative, that’s a problem. He said “that’s why you don’t wanna know how the sausage gets made. Literally. There’s no way to ethically feed billions of people.” 

My mom then said that the only reason humans are human is because our ancestors ate meat, and that we owe our advanced brains to animal protein. My dad said that it’s hard to be healthy while being vegan.

Then both my parents started talking about how the animals we consume are treated humanely before they die and how they’re killed just as humanely.

After telling me what a horrible idea it is to go vegan, my mom said “but look how much I already support you! I’ve been making plant based meals every now and then, and I buy so many vegetables!” She then said how most vegans are super unhealthy because they’re “junk-food vegans”, and that if I did go vegan “one day”, she’d make sure I wasn’t “one of those vegans”. I told her I’d be an adult by then and I wouldn’t need my mother choosing my food for me. I felt like the conversation wasn’t going anywhere so I walked off.

As I was leaving, my mom said “jeez. Was there a script you wanted me to read off of? I’m sorry I didn’t say what you wanted me to.”

Naturally I came back and told her that wasn’t what was going on, I just regretted saying anything to begin with and felt like we weren’t getting anywhere. I gave in and said I’d just wait to go vegan until after I left home.

She said “fine. Believe me, I can’t *wait* to stop cooking for you. Only two more years of this. I can’t wait.” I said “no one is forcing you to cook for us.” And I left, feeling like shit.

I’m pretty sure I heard them talking about me after I left. I don’t see why they can’t just accept my decision. It doesn’t effect them at all. It would have been one thing if I had asked them for their input, but I didn’t ask, I just told them what my decision was and they immediately started criticizing it.

One of my earliest memories is from when I was 3ish years old. I was playing on our patio and saw a lady bug. I remember wanting to see what would happen if I squished it.

Idk I knew it would squish but I think that I thought it would flatten and pop back up like in a cartoon. I took a plastic picnic table we had and crushed the ladybug. I still remember the sound. And when I picked the table up it was crushed and not moving. And it didn't pop back and I realized I had killed it.

That's as far as I remember but apparently I screamed really loud and my mom ran out because she literally thought I was being kidnapped or something. I was so inconsolable that I had hurt the lady bug... And clearly it was more than just childish overdramatization considering it's like my first memory. 

Idk it just makes me think that if we could let kids make their own choices they would never eat meat. It isn't in our nature to want to hurt animals at all. I also wanted to stop eating meat when I was a bit older and realized that people ate ducks and that the chicken I ate was animal parts...

They get tons of veggies, fruit, snacks, love, safety from local predators, space to roam, and access to their eggs for days at a time in case they need the nutrients from their eggs that they would normally eat in the wild.

One person said that they should be set free but I can 100% promise you they would die in the wild.

Is it wrong to eat the leftover eggs that the chickens don’t eat themselves? Obviously you’re not vegan then, but at least your not supporting factory farming. Sooooo am I evil?

Any ideas for books to check out are greatly appreciated! I do also appreciate individual recipes if that's all you know of, but it will be hit or miss if I'm able to have it.

My allergies are soy (yeah I know that's tough for Chinese food but I'm figuring out quite a lot of substitutes!), eggplant, avocado, yeast, garlic, and this isn't an allergy but I can't have wheat due to my Crohn's disease. Ginger also messes with me sometimes because of my Mast Cell Activation Syndrome, but it's not consistent. Yeah this is quite the list, I know. Hence why I'm struggling.

At this point, I feel like I’m too depressed to be motivated for basic upkeep of myself. As a result, my periods became so irregular, and I’ve lost so much weight and cannot gain it back. I’m almost borderline underweight. 

So I resorted to ordering food delivery literally everyday (I don’t have a car to do takeout and the spots I can eat at are not within walking distance), with a mixture of groceries because I don’t want to have strictly delivery. I’ve spent at least $3k in those 5 months on this, maybe even $4k. So I’ve been getting more calories in and my period went back to being regular. 28 days on the dot for 5 months straight. But my pockets are shot when I’m supposed to be saving to move out.

So the past few of months, I’ve been trying to force myself to cook and eat, and this is quick or easy kind of foods (throw it in an oven, microwave, etc.) but I don’t think anyone understands how hard these basic tasks are for me, especially if I need to cook more nutrient-dense, calorie-heavy foods. Plus, I can’t stomach even half as much home-cooked meals than I can with delivery. I get full fast, and half the time I lose my appetite altogether. 

People keep telling me to just start meal prep, toss food in a slow cooker, eat this, eat that, do X, Y, and Z. It’s not about what to do, it’s the effort. Now I feel so much pressure and like a failure because these basic tasks are no-brainers for the average person. But it’s a difficult chore for me.

Still, 3 months later trying to eat from home, and I thought I was doing good with it, but I’m still not eating enough calories. Some days I eat 2-3 times a day and only manage &lt;1k calories, some days I only eat once or not at all.

And now my period is late. Last month, my period came early at 26 days. I knew what this meant, and I’ve been trying to eat more, but now I’m 1 day late and still don’t feel the signs that it’s coming yet. This is what my periods have looked like in the past year: https://imgur.com/a/Mg9lKMV

Eating was a lot easier before I was vegan, because all the processed and fast food was cheap if need be while providing all the calories. Then I’d just take multivitamins. 

But being vegan is proving extremely difficult for me, and I’m hating myself so much for it. I went vegan for ethical reasons, so I simply cannot stomach the idea of eating animals, and I’m still struggling with eating enough.

&amp;#x200B;

During the past decade, veganism has become a viable, mainstream alternative to the traditional western omnivore diet, it is now more accepted than ever and its benefits are backed up by science. However, it still isn’t something completely normalized especially in developing countries and there’s still a lot of work left to do for environmental and vegan activists.

Now, in my opinion, the reason why this uphill battle is so much more difficult than it should be is that mainstream vegan activism is so overly aggressive that it turns potential “allies” into disassociated, indifferent assets. PETA, for better or worse, is the face of the vegan brand around the world, and its marketing approach is horrendously hostile, actively insulting people. Listen to this, You will NEVER change someone’s mind when you start a conversation with “You are wrong, stupid, and a bad person; here’s why…” call it immaturity, overly sensitivity, whatever, that fact remains true. That’s the same reason why climate change awareness is so difficult to get across people’s minds, very few people have the ability to be that introspective and take that amount of personal responsibility, to sacrifice something without a tangible reward for them.

You are right. You have the truth and the moral high ground on your side. Use that responsibly, use it as a tool and not as a weapon. Instead of sharing belligerent memes to “fight back” the status quo or the obnoxious, intolerant people that you have come across with; be patient instead. Create a platform and a space where people can feel safe talking to you and asking questions and seeking help. Most of us have been conditioned and indoctrinated to eat meat and dairy products. Stop acting like it's not hard, stop acting like it isn’t a hardship for some to leave something that brings them so much joy. I’ve lived in several countries throughout my life and you have no idea how out of touch you can sound when you nag people who are trying to quit meat gradually instead of instantly. In third world countries, vegan alternatives are much more difficult to acquire and the building blocks for a well-balanced, tasty diet without the help of animal-based products are simply not there sometimes. People find comfort in their favorite food and to take that away from them is going to be challenging but if you want to gain more followers in your movement I implore you to leave the self-righteousness behind and learn to be resilient. Ignorant people will give you shit, so what? Prove that you are in this for the right reasons and talk to them, teach them and be patient. It takes time for people to come around and find within themselves the answers and strength to take this kind of life-changing decision.

All of you together need to change your radical approach. I know that animals are being tortured to an incomprehensible level, but if you want to win this generational war, you need to do it with kindness and understanding. You may think it's dumb and that people should just “grow up” and do the right thing. Well, guess what: that’s not gonna happen by guilting them. That’s why there are so many visceral attacks against you, people are in denial and have protective mechanisms, you shall strip those down one at a time. You may be thinking “Changing people is not my responsibility” and you are right, this post is written for those of you who already had taken on that responsibility, who have already talked to your friends and family, and are active on social media, and donate, and volunteer your time.

Slow and steady wins the race. You are on the right side of history and if you know history you understand that these things are won by fighting methodically, not emotionally.

More than 63 billion terrestrial animals and, by very conservative  estimates, more than 103 billion aquatic animals are killed for human  consumption every year. The amount of death and suffering is simply staggering.  
&gt;  
&gt;If any other species caused as much damage as humans do, we would think it wrong to breed new members of that species  
&gt;  
&gt;All this is caused by the human appetite for animal flesh and  products, an appetite shared by the great majority of humans. Using very  conservative estimates, every human (who is not a vegetarian or vegan)  is, on average, responsible for the death of 27 animals per year, or  1,690 animals over the course of a lifetime.  
&gt;  
&gt;Perhaps you think that by raising vegan children you can evade the  reach of the misanthropic argument. However, each new child, even if a  vegan, is very likely to contribute to environmental damage, one of the  means whereby humans harm humans and other animals. In the developed  world, the per-capita contribution to environmental degradation is  considerable. It is much lower in the developing world, but the much  higher birthrate there offsets the per-capita saving.  
&gt;

This feeling has caused me to buy 5 pigs in hopes of giving them a life outside of the slaughterhouse. My first 4 pigs i had to give to animal sanctuaries because I didn't have a place where the landlord was OK with them.

My mum often scolds me that I was wrong and irresponsible. I don't think she understands how deeply I love animals despite becoming a vegetarian after I became one aged 12. I honestly do not regret getting my first 4 pigs because the fact is they would be dead right now had I not bought them.

Right now I have my 5th pig. I will admit to you I didn't have permission from my landlord to get a pig but I was hoping my flatmates wouldn't mind. However one minded. The pig happened to run off at which point it was taken to a stable pending the ear tag which I then ordered. I have now collected the pig and taken it to pet boarding pending moving into a rented flat with a garden in a few days.

I am being totally honest here when I say i didn't look for housing until after having the pig, largely because I doubted any landlord would say yes but I couldn't take it any more thinking of innocent creatures dying.

I did spend some time with the pig for 4 days before it was at the stable or pet boarding. Another thing that made me worry I'm a bad person is that I took the pig on a walk and it only walked with me half the time and it plopped down and I dragged it a bit because it was too heavy to hold. It's 3 months old but it weights almost 35 kg. I then noticed part of its skin was bleeding and I felt really bad like wow this is my fault.

I also find myself flying by the seat of my pants because I find most online info too confusing to understand. However I have requested contact info for the farm from where the stable orders pig feed so I should be able to feed it properly going forward. This morning I fed it a whole easter cake. I felt a bit ashamed though that I googled can pigs eat dog food before taking my pig to the pet boarding.

I guess all this has made me feel like, I do have good intentions but I sometimes think I'm some sort of idiot because of all the trouble I get into with my piglets and I wonder if something is wrong with my brain.

I will say my pig liked me very much. It loved sitting on my lap and lying next to me. It loved spooning as well and often fell asleep next to me.

Anyways I'm open to suggestions.",True,False,False,vegan,t5_2qhpm,584571,public,self,I try to help animals but have made plenty of mistakes in the process.

For example, 
I went to visit my dad and stepmother (farmers) last summer. 
I told them I was vegan so I wouldn’t be eating most of their food, I brought my own, no big deal right? 

My half-brother is a vegeterian slowly turning to veganism, so we were talking about it in the kitchen while my sister, brother in-law (also farmer) and stepmother were speaking to each other. 

When they heard what we were talking about they just HAD to start a debate about these things. I was pretty civil but they just were so fucking wrong about everything. 

They said the classic arguments: “we treat our animals well” and “that sort of treatment of animals doesnt happen in our country” and “where do you get your protein?” etc etc

Things got sort of heated on their end, I just quoted Earthling Ed mostly and defended my position. I didnt want to make things awkward so every fiber of my being went into being calm. 

Then my stepmother said: “We LOVE our animals” 
and I replied: “I dont believe you can love an animal, while killing it and profiting from their death”. 

I could tell it struck a nerve so I backed down but I could tell it made her very upset. 

Ever since she’s been very distant and cold to me.
I get it, I struck a nerve. 

But what I don’t get, is people who start a debate out of nowhere when I tell them Im vegan. Then when I defend myself and my position they act like Im “the crazy vegan who won’t shut up about veganism”

I've linked my 6 month update above in case anyone wants to read it. I'm 35, British, male, and live in Rome, Italy. The Friday after we locked down here for covid (Friday 6th March) I idly wondered if I could manage to not eat dairy, meat or fish for a week - well, that felt good and manageable, so it became a month and now I'm a year in. Thought I should share my experiences in case anybody wants to hear it

weight - I lost it, I'm about 6'2 and weighed around 81kg (I didn't regularly weigh myself before going vegan) - summer last year I'd sometimes be as little as 73 kg (but I think that's cos sometimes in the summer you feel you don't need to eat much). I've settled at about 75kg and I'm still eating an awful lot while doing hardly any exercise

Muscle definition is better, more pronounced, I nearly have abs, waist goes in more, though I think I'm still using the same hole on my belt

Skin - far better, old marks (not scars, but just things that are about orange or purpley which have appeared without reason at some time or another on my skin, are fading or have faded completely. Mosquito bites seem to heal more quickly too. 

Skin on body is also somehow softer/ smoother - tricky one to describe

skin on face - basically no breakouts now (fingers crossed) . I was certainly still annoying getting spots now and then despite being well past my teenage years, but now my skin is clear, though wearing a mask all day a lot of the time cos of covid often dries out the skin just to the side of my nose, but then we'll have half term (I'm a teacher) and I wear masks way less and it's clear that's just down to the masks

Last time, in the 6 month update I wrote about possibly being less wrinkly, dunno about that

face is definitely leaner though, cheekbones more pronounced

nose is less stuffy/ blocked - used to be I would put those strips on my nose to keep the nostrils open while I slept, now I don't need them

Think I'm sleeping better

Think possibly, I'm recovering faster when I do go for a run (my main form of exercises). I haven't been running regularly recently, but when I have I feel like that soreness I'd sometimes get in my thighs - Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness is the name I think, is lesser than I might expect. It seems that plant-based athletes recover more quickly and can train more as a result - I'm hardly an example of this but did think I should say. About a month ago I managed to run 12k on Saturday morning and then 10 on the Sunday  - not sure I've done that much on successive days since Jan 2018 (I'd done a marathon in 2017 and wanted to better my time, but ended up injuring myself). My usual run ( is 5-8 km), Wasn't particularly sore afterwards after that weekend either

My nails are growing more quickly, I'm basically wolverine

people talk about having more energy - I don't know about that, I've always had loads of energy from first thing in the morning onwards (once was nicknamed the duracell bunny)

Possibly TMI stuff - so feel free to avoid

BO - dramatically reduced, to the degree that I don't bother with deodorant any more (before I used to use one of those deo blocks from lush). I don't work in construction or a really physical job or anything, but it does get hot obviously here in Italy, and even after i go running or whatever my tee-shirts and my armpits don't smell too bad

Digestion - I've never had a problem with constipation, always attributing this to plenty of exercise and fruit, but shall we say, I have even less of a problem now. Perhaps I used to make 1 or 2 ""sitting visits"" to the bathroom every day, now it's more like 3 or 4 - suppose I might be spending more on toilet paper - is this why being vegan is generally thought to be so expensive? For the first few days though, digestion was interesting, I didn't have diarrhoea or anything, but ready access to a toilet was useful, luckily I was working from home - it even came out green a few times

Erections - feel like they're harder, perhaps last longer and perhaps that my ""recovery time"" is less. Used to be, after I came that'd be it for that session and the little guy was having a rest for a few hours, but lately, I reckon round 2 might be on the cards. Also, I did wonder, months back, whether I'd gotten slightly bigger when hard, than usual, not so that anyone else would notice, it's not like I gained inches, but it felt slightly different in my hand - could just be that that's because it's harder, or maybe I really did gain something (in girth). This doesn't really matter, it could all be in my head (I typed hand there accidentally lol) it's not about to affect my relationship, the difference, if there is one, is minimal, but wanted to put it out there. Dunno if my cum tastes better, sorry. 

end of the TMI

Think eating plant-based has helped me with a long-term injury, I got illiotibial band syndrome in Jan 2018 and since then have alternately rested and down lots of stretching and exercises to strengthen and heal it, and sometimes run, while takign care to try to not to worsen it. It seems almost healed now (plant foods should have helped with inflammation in theory) - trouble is I complicated it on one of my occasional runs (before going plant-based) and managed to give myself hip bursitis/ trochanteritis - though this is also getting better, and I also attribute it's getting better partly to Time, the great healer, and partly to my diet. 

Honestly, I don't see myself eating meat, fish or dairy again, I'm really happy with my diet, and as time goes on, and now I find the animals rights and environmental reasons equally compelling. My friends and family know I'm vegan, and I've been encouraging them to try it, colleagues at work know and gently take the piss, but they can see that I'm the healthiest person there I mean, I prob was before too, so for me that makes it more compelling - I didn't have too much spare weight on me as far as I was concerned, or any worrying health problems, but all these unexpected benefits happened. At the same time as safeguarding my future health, I'm able to advocate for animal rights and be more environmentally friendly.

Some resources I've found really helpful are Mic the vegan on youtube

Michael Greger's how not to die book, and his website nutritionfacts

plant-based news on youtube is good too

The latest documentary I watched was “Seepiracy” on Netflix, and it was just hard to watch.

Maybe it’s not much but I understand that every little step counts. So “I don’t want to be attached to that industry” anymore.

I'm not particularly interested in consuming lab grown meat myself. After being vegan for a while the appeal of it just vanished. I don't even really like plant based imitation meat if it's *too* close to the real thing because it weirds me out. But I do understand not everyone feels the same, and it is potentially very important as either a gateway or a means for the wider population to go vegan.

So I was thinking about this and I realised that I don't know enough about the potential environmental impact. Lab grown meat *should* be at least a little more efficient, surely? There's always going to be some kind of inefficiency in converting plant matter into animal matter, but animals also do all sorts of crazy things that farmers deem unnecessary like moving or having any quality of life.

Here's what I need more help with: is the saving good enough?

This list of crucial nutrients for vegans are made for europeans. Selenium for example is no problem for people who are living in places with selenium rich soils like canada or huge parts of the US. I also wrote down how I recommend getting these nutrients. 

Very Very Crucial:
- Vitamin B12 (supplement)

Very Crucial:
- Vitamin D (not just for vegans; people who don't live in sunny areas of the World should supplement it)
- Iodine (also depends on your location; i recommend a supplement since the Iodine content in algae is hugely varying)
- DHA (seeds with high ALA contents like flax, chia or hemp, if you are worried about your conversion rate, better supplement it together if EPA)

Crucial:
- zinc (legumes, pumpkin/sunflower/chiaseeds, some nuts etc.)
- EPA (Same as DHA, but less crucial, because ALA is converted easier into EPA than into DPA)
- selenium (this depends on your local soil, I recommend a supplement, because the selenium content of brazil nut are hugely varying)

Less crucial:
- iron (seeds, dried apricots, oat, legumes, etc.)
- vitamin B2 (found in small parts in many foods, so it should add up even if you never thought about your B2 intake, very good sources are mushrooms and almonds)
- calcium (plant Milk with extra calcium, greens, many other vegetables, nuts, mineral water, etc.)
- vitamin K2 (can be converted from K1, best source is kale) 

Not really crucial, but worth mentioning:
- protein (legumes, whole grains, nuts, seeds, etc)
- lysine (most crucial amino acid for vegans and one of the many reasons you should eat your legumes every day, some seeds also have huge amounts)
- energy (you should consider eating more, since vegan foods tend to have a lower calorie density)

Also notice that Vitamin A is easy to get from conversation from beta carotene, but some people (I think one in 10.000, but idk the exact number) can't convert beta carotene properly, these people should consider eating more carots, sweet potatoes and pumpkins or taking a retinol supplement.

I feel crazy. I’m having difficulty coping, and I need a safe place to express my thoughts. 

For five days, I’ve been obsessively following the animals that are being left to die in the Suez Canal. The thought of the heat, the excruciating discomfort, thirst, and hunger, standing in their own feces... I’m a wreck. If an article pops up and I read it, I have the urge to smash my phone on the wall. I’m furious this is happening and that there’s nothing I can do. I can’t find a way to help, a way to donate. I know they are going to their death either way, but slaughter is less cruel than starvation and high heat. Any time I see stories like this, like when pigs were being inhumanely killed en masse during the pandemic because demand for bacon went down, or when I watch a documentary on the livestock industry, I’m a wreck. Which is a problem, because part of my job for 5 years has been to teach students about animal agriculture. I cry every day after school during that unit. I’ve been vegan for over ten years. I help run a farm sanctuary that someone else started. I can’t do anything else. I’ve sunk all my money and time into helping these animals. I left my first job because I couldn’t stomach animal testing and the dead beagles I’d pass every day in the freezer, even if I wasn’t directly involved. Knowing there were puppies who would spend their short lives in a cage being fed research chemicals right next to my lab left me suicidal.  I couldn’t do anything. I couldn’t save them. I couldn’t even go in to look at them.  There’s so much unnecessary, human-inflicted suffering in the world, and I have a hard time keeping a level head about it. I know it’s not helpful. But I hate not being able to help. Sometimes I feel like if I suffer with them, if I starve, if withhold water from myself, maybe I’ll feel less worthless. But that’s mental illness. I don’t know how to cope. How do you cope? How do you watch the videos and keep up with the news? I used to slaughter pigs before I started rescuing them. I was a different person. I don’t know how I did that, and I can never forgive myself. Every day I feel like I deserve to die. I’m powerless. I’m part of the problem.  I don’t know what to do.

\- Amy's baked ziti ""kids meal."" I felt a little silly buying it as an adult, but that thing was so, so good. Every part of it. I don't know how in the world Amy's managed to make a little piece of frozen foccacia bread taste so delicious.

\- Kashi's Sicilian veggie pizza. This one came out before its time, and now that plant-based and non-dairy stuff has grown more popular, I think it would be a huge hit. You can tell it came out 10+ years ago, because all the online reviews about it are just omnivore dorks complaining that it doesn't have cheese.

\- Dark chocolate chunk Luna bars. I don't know how the hell these got discontinued! They were delicious! 

\- Original Tings. The quality of these was really hit-or-miss. Some bags were way, way underseasoned, but the good bags were so good that they made you forget your disappointment. I have been trying to find a replacement for these with no success so far.

And the man (Gojira's singer and frontman) talks about why he went vegan, explaining how the animal food industry actually works and, frankly, it struck me. I already knew the way in which the cow is made to produce milk (by getting her pregnant and taking the calf out of her when it is born), and I really feel guilty for having been involved in all of this. Inside me I feel the moral need to have to change to be less and less complicit in these activities but I'm afraid of failing miserably. Right now I eat meat 2-3 times a week and animal products are like 90% of my diet and honestly I find it hard for me to stop consuming all of that. So I ask you: how did you do it? Did you remove everything overnight or did you opt for a slower transition? I would be forced to take supplements or are there any surrogates for those nutrients present in animal food/products? How much would it affect the environment if I stopped eating meat and other animal products?

https://preview.redd.it/96csy5nk1fq61.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0aa778ea8ba7325774f50459cd935320f98df0a6

So what's that ? A pizza. One that is vegan and cheese free.  
So what ? So begin the story of an individual who knocked down everything he knew about how the things are supposed to be.

&amp;#x200B;

Veganism changed my take on pizza. When I made my first vegan pizza years ago, **I was sooooo attached to put cheese replacement**. That's how it is supposed to be, that's how tradition works, that's how it will be. Oh god... I had hard time to swallow those industrial vegan cheese. My tummy was not happy. Years later, I now make pizza without cheese. Some people around me feel like it's not ""real"" pizza, because we don't have the pleasure of that melted cheese string growing as you try to tear it the higher you raise it. And I get it. It was 30 years of habits that I had to put aside. I loved every single cheese string. But pizza (sorry dear italian) can be and will from now on (for me at least) be enjoyed without cheese or any kind of replacement. It *just* requires to deconstruct what society told you pizza should be. As the song says : ""**make your own kind of pizza, topped it with your own special parts""** or something like this. I don't know 😊

&gt;For those who don't have the song reference, here it is : [https://youtu.be/iQ7dTMPwUi8](https://youtu.be/iQ7dTMPwUi8)

I know. I know. ""Dude, it's just a freaking pizza..."". I guess you are right. But this pizza right here is the results of years of years of social deconstruct. Not just veganism, oh no. I wish it was that simple. It catapulted me in a world I never though to discover. A world where I had to deconstruct my whole social world.

It's a muscle. Every time I watched a documentary on veganism, that muscle activated. Doubt everything, question everything. Is this how things are supposed to be ? Why male character have more dialogue time in Disney than female one ? Are electric cars really that green ? Are we supposed to be all boy / girl ? Why should asian should be good at math and ""rice eater"" when I eat more rice than 80% of the one I know ? Should I eat this boeuf bourguignon at Christmas because we've been doing it since I was born ? Why is it that I should have a kid by now ?

It may be be far-fetched. I mean, the guy is writing about LGBTQIA+, about food, about relation between men and women (and all those in-between, my bad I'm not familiar enough yet). Well it all boiled down to that one simple thing : social deconstruct.

30 years of having meat every meals. 30 years of drinking milk because ""they are our friends"" (french ads). 30 years of considering meat manly and vegetables an option. And so much more.

I am thankful for veganism. Not because I live an (almost) cruelty free lifestyle, but because I had to deconstruct the world around me and ended up more humble about my life as a white guy in a developped country, and compassionate for those who must endure.

For a great number of people, being vegan is about the animals and the cruelty. I'm not completely there yet but someday I will. God I hate those ingredients list that ends with 0.01% of powedered milk. For now, it is about deconstructing everything I know about the world I was raised in.

And that, dear readers, is a pizza which has been socialy deconstructed and rebuilt from scratch. Well almost, I still make them round most of the time, with tomato sauce and all but you got the idea. The best I have every week for several months now. One day I'll be fully vegan, one deconstruction at a time.

Not sure about the goal of this post, probably some make my ego blush a tinny little bit but I also hope it could serve some people to tackle way more than veganism in their path.

So I haven’t found my vegan tribe. I only have 1 vegan friend who I hang out with sometimes &amp; lives in the same city as me.

A) all drugs you buy come from probably come from some kind of gang, that will engage in violence with their competitors which causes a great deal of suffering,

I have read a good deal about veganism for health, but the info seems to be more generalized, so was hoping someone might have some personal experience with this. 

I have endometriosis and it is not very well controlled with medications. Most people think it's just painful period cramps, but I don't even get a period and am usually in like, excruciating pain almost everyday. There is a lot more involved, but that is the gist of it. It sucks.

I have been looking a lot into dietary changes to help and have even tried a few different protocols myself, such as low fodmap, AIP etc. Most of these diets are fairly low-carb and nearly impossible to sustain on a vegan or even vegetarian diet. I was actually a vegetarian for 16 years and eventually started eating meat about 4 years ago at the advice of my medical team, RDs, etc. so that I could follow these plans. But I just don't buy the idea that eating a meat-heavy diet is helpful, especially considering all of the hormones and antibiotics animals are given, and it goes against so much of my morals and ethics. I am trying to avoid a hysterectomy (I'm only 30!!) and was just so desperate.

Has anyone had any success with veganism helping endometriosis symptoms? At this point I will probably head toward veganism either way, but was hoping for some insight and maybe some hope, haha.

I haven't watched it, but it does come up if you type in any vegan documentary into the Netflix search bar, so I was curious to know if other vegans think its worth watching or talking about (considering how everyone has been buzzing about the new Seaspiracy documentary here).

Documentaries like Earthlings and Dominion center around animal welfare and ethics, so they are really pro vegan and environment, whereas Cowspiracy, What the Health, and Game Changers really just focus on the human experience in terms of health and fitness. The don't really dig deeper to question morality and speciesism. The two documentaries that present the strongest ethical cases are the two that Netflix does not offer. It's good that Netflix has a few plant based diet documentaries, but I really hope they open their catalog to more bitter truths. I'm going to be watching Seaspiracy this week, but judging from the trailer I can tell it's not really about the animals, its about the pollution and industry agendas as a whole. Which is fine, but that really is only the tip of the iceberg. Hopefully I am wrong about this assumption and it really does create a voice for the animals that are suffering and being slaughtered.

Netflix plays a major role in a lot of people's worldly education, just because of their extensive list of easily accessible documentaries.

Being the upvote whore that i am, i thought i would copy paste it in case anyone here cared :p)

This post ended up being really long and rambling, so im adding this at the start. TL;DR i went from meat lover to vegan almost literally overnight because of Alex's arguments for veganism, and the documentary ""land of hope and glory"" by Earthling Ed was what pushed me over the edge and finally made me abandon my cognitive dissonance and excuses i was making.

I dont know if he reads anything on this sub, but if by any chance Alex sees this, then thank you for all your work and opening my eyes to the immense amount of suffering and death that i have been supporting all my life up until this point.

Ive been watching for a while, mainly interested in the philosophical arguments after watching atheist experience for a number of years, and honestly, when he first started doing veganism related content, i wasnt very interested and only flicked through a couple of videos not really paying attention. But something stuck in my mind and eventually i came back to watch a bunch of it fully, and i came to the realization that there is simply no valid argument (at least for someone in my position) for consuming animal products in the way i did. I resisted at first, mainly using a pretty lazy and nihilistic justification of ""well, im such a small cog in the machine, what im doing makes no REAL difference""...But i felt a pang of guilt every time i ate meat. This lasted, i think, several months.

Then roughly a week or so ago, i sat down (with a pork sausage sandwich) and started browsing youtube videos, and i come across podcast #9 with Earthling Ed ([https://youtu.be/r-BTN8Ajs04](https://youtu.be/r-BTN8Ajs04)). I watch for a little while and am hit with the same guilt ive been feeling more and more often as (what i now recognize to be...) my cognitive dissonance starts to break down. Partway through the video Earthling Ed's documentary ""land of hope and glory"" was mentioned (i had never heard of him or any of his work before watching the interview - link to the documentary &gt; [https://www.landofhopeandglory.org/](https://www.landofhopeandglory.org/)) and i was curious, so i paused that video and googled it, and started watching. The pork sausage sandwich is about half eaten at this point.

As much as i kind of hate overly dramatic language like this, i dont think its an exaggeration to say that video changed my life. I had heard before about the process of slaughtering animals, about how they were stunned with a boltgun and then had their throats cut, or how pigs were put into gas chambers. But i had never actually been confronted with it. Never been forced to witness an actual intelligent living animal screaming in pain and terror and clawing at the cage around it as it suffocated to death. Or witnessing a cow fail to be stunned in a setting right out of a cheesy torture-porn horror movie and have its throat slashed while still conscious and its horrific writhing as it bleeds to death. And as silly as it sounds, i remember looking at that sausage sandwich on my desk and something finally clicked in my head and i no longer saw it as just a tasty lunch, but as a lump of dead meat from a tortured animal. And i simply could not finish that sandwich, i even tried to reason with myself that it was just a waste of food to throw it away at this point, but i just couldn't stomach it.

And from there, the floodgates had opened, i realized that if i couldn't eat meat anymore, then milk and cheese were off the table too, since those industries were just as bad for all the same reasons. Fish i found were more difficult to empathize with, and i almost flirted with the idea of going vegan except still consuming fish, until i mentally slapped myself with how silly that idea was. ""can fish really feel pain? i swear i read they couldnt..."" a quick google informed me that, yes, fish have nervous systems and therefore feel pain, duhhhhh. And of course i realized that ive always found the Japanese whaling industry incredibly problematic, so why am i applying those standards to large sealife but not smaller ones?

Ive not been vegan long now, as i said, about a week. But honestly, what has surprised me most is this...ITS SO EASY. I had this idea in my head before that i would have to be some sort of ridiculous ""taste martyr"" to be vegan and exist off of salad and nuts for the rest of my life... and then i had my first vegan sausage and realised, if i didnt know better, I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS MEAT. Alternative cheese, butter, milk, chicken, sausages etc... it all tastes really good?! What the hell?! Why isnt this better known?! As for health, my diet has been quickly improving, im still consuming wayyyyy too much sugar (im far too addicted to fizzy drinks) But im eating far more leafy greens, veg and fruit, and im really enjoying it!

The only problem im having now is trying not to be the ""preachy vegan"" to my family. I dont know whats right at this point, to live and let live, or to really try and push what ive learned on those close to me. I almost feel obligated to try and spread the message at this point as penance for all the suffering ive caused.

He wrote the following about a Master Hugh:

&gt;My mistress was, as I have said, a kind and tender-hearted woman; and in the simplicity of her soul she commenced, when I first went to live with her, to treat me as she supposed one human being ought to treat another. In entering upon the duties of a slaveholder, she did not seem to perceive that I sustained to her the relation of a mere chattel, and that for her to treat me as a human being was not only wrong, but dangerously so. Slavery proved as injurious to her as it did to me. When I went there, she was a pious, warm, and tender-hearted woman. There was no sorrow or suffering for which she had not a tear. She had bread for the hungry, clothes for the naked, and comfort for every mourner that came within her reach. Slavery soon proved its ability to divest her of these heavenly qualities. Under its influence, the tender heart became stone, and the lamblike disposition gave way to one of tiger-like fierceness. The first step in her downward course was in her ceasing to instruct me. She now commenced to practise her husband's precepts. She finally became even more violent in her opposition than her husband himself. 

*Douglass 43*

He later states;

&gt;. . . for, during this interval, a great change had taken place in Master Hugh and his once kind and affectionate wife. The influence of brandy upon him, and of slavery upon her, had effected a disastrous change in the characters of both; . . .

I guess I tried to ignore *how* my food got to me because the reality was a little hard to stomach. So naturally, as a selfish human, I repressed the facts and continued to indulge in animal products. 

This morning, all of that changed. Watching “Seaspiracy” on Netflix literally broke my heart. I love my planet... I love the ocean, I love the whales? I love the dolphins, the sea turtles, the fishies.... but how dare I ever say that if I am contributing to the extinction of the most gentle creatures in the sea?!? 

As the documentary ended, my stomach initially churned with disgust in myself. “No more seafood!” I said to myself.  But then instantly, I remember one of the whale poachers saying that he saw it no different than the meat industry... and he has a damn good point. 

I love animals. I love this planet. I want to do whatever it takes to save it... and despite my LOVE for meat (like, you guys have no idea, I love LOVE love seafood and meat), I’m ready to put it behind me. I’ve tasted some delicious plant based alternatives before, as per the generosity of my sisters... so I know that I’ll be able to continue enjoying the juicy flavors and textures of our fuzzy and fishy friends. Plant based foods have come such a long way!! 


I know this is probably a very boring and jumbled post... but I don’t have anyone to really talk to about it right now and I feel like such a new woman already. I’m ready to do my part and I just hope that the whole world can begin to fee this way, too. 

I’m going in for the whole nine yards. NO animal products, not just food, will ever be purchased by myself or my boyfriend ever again. I can’t believe it took me so long... but I’m glad I finally got here.

Like most people I've eaten meat all my life. I met a good friend online who's been vegan for about 5 years now. He's helped me find alternatives and been very welcoming and accepting that changing your entire lifestyle is difficult much like changing your religion isn't an overnight rewire of your brain. I know veganism is more than a diet, its an ethical at its core. Ive been looking for resources and groups to help me keep my mind on the goal of being a better person and helping build a better world for animals and humans alike. 

I still have thoughts of eating meat and can't seem to tear the wall down between the animals I want to save and the cravings I still get. Ive changes almost all of my diet apart from eggs and fish which are the last 2 mental walls I have to overcome but I still crave meat.

 This brings me to the question I posed in the title. Why does this subreddit seem so hostile? From the posts I've read I expect to be called names and down voted for my curiosity. Not everyone is the same, in the same place mentally, or wired the same way.

The hens, if no rooster was present, would rarely be broody (they were rarely broody even with a rooster), so the eggs were just left in the nest. I understand going vegan out of concern for animals and their treatment, but in this case, no animal is being harmed and it keeps animals like snakes and raccoons out of your coop because they know there are no eggs. Is there anything that makes eating these eggs unethical in your eyes, or would it be okay because you own these chickens and they're free-range - not being forced to live in terrible conditions to maximize production?

I'm just genuinely curious! I choose vegan options at the store when possible (if I have the budget for it since it can get expensive), but I spent the majority of my childhood raising chickens and just couldn't get this question out of my head. **I do understand not wanting to buy eggs in the store because of the horrible conditions they keep chickens in.** 

(I would also just genuinely like to know what made you choose to go vegan, questions aside! Did you start out vegetarian first, or did you hop right in?)

I hope none of my questions offend and thank you for taking the time to read this! I just want to become more educated on the topic and understand it from a different perspective.

*Processing video b86onllzv6q61...*

Hi Everyone,

**This is about her survival and how you can help**

Vivek here, the person in the video is my sister, Kriti. I will try to make this as short as possible, but at the same time, request you to read this entirely.

**Since past 10 years, my sister has been fighting BLOOD CANCER - Chronic Myeloid Leukemia,** it is very dangerous disease which requires weekly blood test, chemo meds and hospital visit, she has been visiting hospital every month for past 10 years.

Now, her disease has progressed to **Advance Stage** as she developed drug-resistance towards all chemo medicine available.  
**She has suffered enough pain, needles and dreading hospital visit in past 10 years, please understand the pain and come forward.**

Only solution for us is if she finds a ""**TISSUE-TYPE"" matching BLOOD STEM CELL DONOR, who can donate few amount of stem cells (just like donating PLATELETs) which help** cure her Blood Cancer.  
**There is no ORGAN OR SURGERY INVOLVED.**

**ISSUE IS:**

* Finding a match is extremely rare. **1 in MILLION** as very few people are registered in stem cell registry.
* People don't realize that everyone ""tissue type"" is **unique and rare,** and only 2-3 people matches with one another in the entire world, so unless they register we can't find match. So by not registering they are not including their tissue type to be matched against her or someone who's cancer you can cure.
* We have tried everything in **past 9 months to get a match, still unable to find one, but her cancer cells are growing rapidly.**

**IMPORTANT: How you can help?**

* You can take a **free swab test, which are delivered to your home to see** if your **""TISSUE TYPE""** is matching with her. **ANY BLOOD GROUP can be a match. (Age: 18-50).**

* **You can help us by asking your family, friends and co-workers to register, share them this link it will have all information.**

**What are STEM CELLs? How donation happens?**

Stem Cell are basic cells, which gets converted into all the other cells of your body like liver cells, tissue cells, blood cells. Stem Cell Donation is similar to Platelet Donation, and **you keep making stem cells in your body, no harm to you, but is a lifesaving treatment for my sister.**

Each of these animals were beautiful complex stars of life who could think and feel pain. And just like that 5 galaxies of them have faded into nothingness.

It is hard to comprehend large numbers, but humans have been staring at the stars ever since we began. During the night we see billions of stars shining in a mass that is our (Soy) Milky Way. We can begin to comprehend how large the galaxy is, and we think nothing could possibly be larger.

We should focus on alleviating the suffering of the animals that are slaughtered entirely needlessly and gratuitously before all else, and I’m not trying to take away from that. 

I still think the suffering of wild animals is something that ought to be taken into account, if not now, then in the future. 

Elephants have only one set of teeth. In the wild, elephants who grow too old die of starvation, because their teeth have worn out. This does not happen in captivity, because they are given special attention, and are allowed to peacefully die of old age. 
Don’t all elephants deserve this fate? I would certainly argue there is not a single elephant that deserves to starve to death, yet this happens quite regularly. 

There are a lot of arguments against humans alleviating animal suffering, but I think only one works: we do not yet have the technology to prevent wild animal suffering on a large scale without doing tremendous harm to the environment. However, I do not believe this will always be the case, and I think every other argument made against it is extremely unconvincing. 

1) Argument: This is anthropomorphic, because “good” and “bad” are human terms

Refutation: An elephant dying of starvation in a field of grass is bad. If you disagree with this point then I’m not sure anything can be done to convince you otherwise. 

2) Argument: Humans should not interfere with nature. This is arrogance. 

Refutation: Humans interfere with nature ALL THE TIME. We’re currently causing the biggest mass extinction in 65 million years. Every time we take medication, we are “interfering with nature”. Every time we chop down a tree we are “interfering with nature”. When we do something awful, something that’s catastrophic on a global scale, cruelty-apologists look the other way, but when we suggest doing something that prevents suffering in animals they’re all “oh let’s not interfere with nature!” Give me a break. 

Wild animals who have undergone predator attacks suffer from PTSD. Nature is generally a terrible place, thriving on suffering.

Obviously, the main conclusion to the documentary is that sustainable farming, only sustains the problem and veganism is the way we can fight against our extinction.

But is this reductive or at least, is this not seeing the forest for the trees? Global capitalism is the reason humans are incentivised to fish animals into extinction, to force people into lives of slavery, to overproduce diseased meat for the cheapest cost to maximize profit. Why doesn't the documentary finger global capitalism as the root cause for coming ecological collapse? While I agree that veganism is certainly an important part of reversing climate catastrophe, as long as capitalism is in place, this wholesale, devil may care destruction of the planet and its organisms will continue.

Are there any counter thoughts on this? If the film was right to couch veganism as the solution to mass extinction, explain it to me.

As a vegan and animal lover, I also... don't hate zoos. I follow a lot of vegan pages on instagram, watch vegan youtubers and over and over I see nothing but hate for zoos. Saying they should all be closed, and that everyone who visits one should be cancelled etc. Usually attached to some old photos from third world country zoos with animals living in horrible conditions. 

My belief is that in an ideal world, zoo's wouldn't exist and every animal would live freely in it's natural habitat. But sadly, we don't live in an ideal world, we live in a world filled with pollution, habitat destruction, hunting, mass scale farming, over-fishing destroying the oceans. And in this world zoo's sadly are vital for the care of wild animals. 

I work in this industry, and see it all from the inside, so I find it upsetting when some vegans are so quick to judge and so short-sighted on zoos. I work in a small town wildlife sanctuary. At this sanctuary yes, we do have animals on display that are captive animals and can't be released to the wild. And yes we charge people tickets to enter because that's the only funding we get. But behind the scenes we have a hospital where we rescue, rehab and release wild animals. Hundreds per year, who never see the public and have limited contact with humans. 

And what do we do when we get a case we can't handle? We take it to the zoo. We are a small establishment with limited facilities, but we have a good relationship with the local zoo which has an amazing big animal hospital.

We get everything from pelicans with fishing wire down their throats to wombats who have been hit by a car. But one thing is consistent to almost all of our rescues, and that is that they are needing to be rescued because of interference from humans in one way or another. We caused the problem, so we feel the need to help fix it. Also, my sanctuary is almost entirely volunteer run. We work long hours, mostly outdoors in all sorts of weather for zero pay, just because we are passionate about helping animals. 

I also recently visited another much larger wildlife sanctuary in a different state, which had about 200-300 animals on display, but in 2020 alone they rescued, rehabed then released 14,000 wild animals. Just in one year! And the truth about this is that no one else can really do this but zoos. People take injured native wildlife to vets, but vets rarely know how to treat animals outside of cats and dogs, and they usually just sit in a cage until they can be transferred to a zoo or specialised wildlife carer. 

Between breeding programs of endangered animals, to all the rescue work with zoo hospitals, to the extensive conservation work done worldwide to help ensure the future of wildlife etc zoos are now vital to our world if you like animals. I see this all from inside the industry so it's kind of frustrating to see vegans pointing to things like Tiger King or third world zoos' or other horrible, abusive attractions and using those to say all zoos are evil and should be closed. If all zoo's closed overnight it would be devastating for the world's wild animals. It's the sad truth. Zoo's aren't all made equal. Worldwide yes, there are some horrific, sad, abusive zoo's and wildlife ""Attractions"" that I wish would close as much as anyone, but that shouldn't diminish the good amazing zoos and the people who work at them.

After we got off the boat and took a stroll around the dock, I saw some men ""scaling"" fish with the back of a knife. It was a violent scraping, and scales were flying in the air. But the fish were still alive during the process, they were wildly flopping around on the workbench as the men tried to hold them down. As a little kid seeing this, I was utterly distraught and it literally traumatized me to some degree. The memory and the sheer callousness of it is still etched into my mind. 

A few years later when I was around 8, my mom had gone grocery shopping and prepared a dinner for the family. When she called me to the table, there was a rack of lamb sitting on a platter. Seeing the little ribcage on our table like that, is when the connection between the animal and my food suddenly became really salient. It wasn't food, it was part of a corpse. I remember being horrified, protesting to my parents about it, storming to my room crying. I knew how precious lambs were and would have done anything to protect them. Since then I had an aversion to any type of meat with visible bones in it. 

(Sidenote: My grandpa had a flock of sheep, and in the springtime I'd get to go and play with the lambs. Years later I would find out that he'd always choose the ""juiciest"" one to be butchered. And then we'd eat its flesh during Christmas dinners and other holidays. None of my family bothered to tell me where the meat came from.)

There are countless more examples. As a kid I saw animals frantically pacing back and forth in tiny zoo enclosures, watched lobsters get chucked into boiling pots of water, etc. I've always found it absolutely horrendous, yet I still didn't go vegan until I was 17.

When I was young I thought vegans were crazy and I remember joking around with my brother about those protein-deficient and opinion-forcing plant eaters. I knew about the facts of the inhumane circumstances of lifestock farming and the outrageous consequences for our enviroment, but never reflected on them.

This all changed when I was 13 in early 2016, I was eating my favourite dish - spaghetti bolognese - when I scrolled through the trending YouTube videos and a video called ""Fleischkonsum zerstört unseren Planeten"" (meat consumption destroys our planet) by the german vegan ""influencer"" Luna Darko came into my sight, she would influence me pretty much in the following year on what person I want to be in the future, she seemed pretty smart and empathic, and often talked about self-love, self discovery, feminism etc. (sadly she deleted this video and distanced herself from the label 'vegan' last year). At this time I was very open and interested in enviromental topics, so I clicked on this video, I remember listening to what she had to say, she sounded very calm, polite and friendly, but you could also tell that this was a very important topic to her, she talked mostly about the eniviroment, but also about the connections to starvation, deseases and health issues and ethics, I remember when she said ""I know this might be the least convincing point for most people, which I think is very sad, cause we should care about this, but a pig has the same cognitive capability as a 3 year old human"", but for me it was one of the most convincing points, beside those about the complex social structures and emotions of cows and chickens. In the following days I gave frequent thoughts on this matter and decided that I want to be vegan myself someday - but not now. My father cooked much meat at this time and I don't wanted the social stigma of a male vegan.

For some reason I didn't even made a first step in the following years, but I knew that becoming vegan was the only right thing to do. I informed myself further on this topic and often argued in favor of veganism, but when a dairy or meat product was on my plate I forgot about it. I devoloped a hobby in cooking in 2017 and became the chef of what I eat, I reduced my flesh consumption, but still ate much of it.

This changed in March 2020 when my school stopped because of a global zoonotic pandemic and I decided to make the first step and got veggie. I knew that this wasn't enough and that I still wanted to be vegan someday, but I loved cheese, which of course I knew isn't a proper reason to eat it, but nevertheless I still ate it. My father, with whom I live with, was very supportive, beside often making stupid jokes and statements.

I became very interested in health topics, and started practising and eating more vegetables, fruits, legumes and whole grains. I read many books and articles and nearly became obsessed with nutrition, so I discovered Niko Rittenau (german vegan nutritionist) and Dr. Michael Greger and read their books ""Vegan-Klischee ade"" (maybe the best book on nutrition, critical nutrients and debunking nutrition based stereotypes about veganism, sadly it's only available in german) and ""How not to die"", which had many shocking facts in it. So I decided to finally go vegan on my 1st anniversary of becoming vegetarian.

It's been one week and it's a miracle - There were 2/3 days in which I craved for cheese, but now, I don't even miss it anymore, despite our fridge being full of it. I am very happy that I'm finally vegan and regret that I haven't done it sooner.

Supporting a gradual change will at very least introduce new options for meals, leading to less death, and at best will make the future change much easier.

First, my brief background is that I’ve been a musician for about 20 years and I’ve been *mostly* vegan for about 2 months. Lifestyle changes take work and time, so please forgive me for the “mostly” qualifier. I’m sure you all understand. 🙂

Anyhow, I immediately (within a day or two) started noticing measurable and subjective improvements in my health. My resting heart rate has lowered from 72 to 56 on average - holy smokes! My wedding ring is also looser. And that brings me to the subjective part. 

It’s fairly well known that a plant based diet lowers inflammation throughout the entire body as compared to a, for lack of a better term, “typical American diet.” But what I didn’t expect was that this would directly transfer to my ability to play my instrument. 

I’m a percussionist, which is basically a pompous high-brow term for drummer (badum-tschhh). When it comes to almost any instrument, a lot boils down to your technique, which determines your energy output and physical stress on soft tissue and joints. Well, in my case, my muscles have been able to fly through music and exercises as if I were 10 years younger, which was actually my peak physical condition. I get less tired, I’m less sore, and I recover much faster. My muscles aren’t are swollen after intense playing and I’m ready to go in less than half the recovery time. 

It’s insane. 

I wanted to share this because it has boosted my mood beyond anything I ever expected. I’m finally jazzed (😏) about drumming again after a 2 year hiatus due to various reasons. I didn’t think an unrelated lifestyle change would make such a huge impact, but it really did. 

Also related, my wife is also a musician (flutist) and she has reported a similar experience.

""The first vegetarian society was formed in 1847 in England. Three years later, Rev. Sylvester Graham, the inventor of Graham crackers, co-founded the American Vegetarian Society. Graham was a Presbyterian minister and his followers, called Grahamites, obeyed his instructions for a virtuous life: vegetarianism, temperance, abstinence, and frequent bathing. In November 1944, a British woodworker named Donald Watson announced that because vegetarians ate dairy and eggs, he was going to create a new term called “vegan,” to describe people who did not. Tuberculosis had been found in 40% of Britain’s dairy cows the year before, and Watson used this to his advantage, claiming that it proved the vegan lifestyle protected people from tainted food. Three months after coining the term, he issued a formal explanation of the way the word should be pronounced: “Veegan, not Veejan,” he wrote in his new [Vegan Society](http://www.vegansociety.com/home.php) newsletter, which had 25 subscribers.

I'm honestly so content with my decision, no more feeling guilty after meals and cringing at chicken carcasses every Sunday. I grew up being extremely fussy and pretty much only eating animal products, I would heave trying to eat vegetables. I knew that I wanted to be vegan, and I knew that I wanted to be healthy, so I ate more vegetables. It was shit at first, but I found ones I liked, and I got to the point where I could make nutritious and delicious vegan meals. I realised that I didn't need animals as a dietary crutch anymore. I know it hasn't been long but honestly, it's been so amazing for both my physical and mental health. I keep having moments where I think to myself 'fuck yeah I'm vegan now.' I come from a family of foodies and I was always the odd one out eating plain chicken and rice, and now I feel like a true foodie along with them. I'm more aligned with my morals, I feel like I am closer to being a true environmentalist now. 

But how do I talk about this to non-vegans? I only have one vegan friend, and since being switching I have noticed a very strange vibe. I haven't been met with all of the 'how do you get your protein?' nonsense just yet. I've had a bit of banter thrown at me for being awkward to buy for and having 'vegan rage' (I had a brief rant about UK tax-subsidies to a work colleague). I haven't been met with animosity, but there is this strange awkwardness.  It's almost as if people avoid the topic altogether. I genuinely thought that people would want to talk about it more, but despite a rise in popularity, I've realised that veganism is still strangely taboo. 

I don't want to be the one to sit at the dinner table talking about cow pus and chicken menstruate. I always wanted to be the 'lead by example' type, as that's how I became vegan, seeing others live happily and healthily doing so. I just didn't realise how profound this change would be for me, and I want to talk about it without feeling like I'm making things awkward. I dunno, I'm sure many of you would say that it's important to have awkward conversations for progress to happen, and I agree with you. I just don't know how to get the party started.

I'm down to ~6 meals per week with meat (eggs/chicken). But my curiosity relates to the relationship between animals and money on the basis of Food and Clothing. 


Food: So when the world has stopped eating meat, what happens to all the pigs, cows, chickens, turkeys, etc? Are they just slaughtered by the millions as factory-farm owners see they're no longer profitable? Is there at all talk of reintroducing cattle to the plains and just letting them roam free? Don't these species, after so many generations of domestication and purposeful breeding, now rely on captivity? Are there any plans to monetize the small-scale domestication of animals for purpose other than meat? What are they?


Clothing pertaining to sheep, alpaca, etc.:
Where do we draw the line on clothing? As far as I know, there's a lot of overlap between vegan and anti climate-change/pollution communities. Wool has special properties like maintaining heat retention properties even when wet. In an ever-trying climate with harsher extremes, we may need this more than ever. Do we keep using sheep for their wool? Alpacas? The replacements are often plastic-based and I don't know which is worse.


Similar arguments often arise concerning climate change—when we can make money at it is when it will be taken seriously, or something along those lines. Countless animals are displaced due to construction, pollution, and more. And there's currently no good way to make money out of helping these animals (Overgeneralization, and please correct me in DMs if that's wrong, but please hear me out). We primarily use nonprofits for that, right? Is there yet a way to make money helping these animals we can advertise? Something I've missed? You can keep your business ideas! I'll work for friggin' minimal wage to save the animals and the world!

This is due to me disagreeing with a fundamental core to veganism, namely the reduction of animal suffering by any practical means. I do not view animal exploitation as inherently evil, I believe it must depend on the circumstances. Almost all forms of animal agriculture today are cruel and I accept that.. leading me to adjust my lifestyle to avoid as much contribution to the industry as I can. However, my disagreements lie in the fact that science is leading to more and more ways where we can use animal products in sustainabe, economical, and less cruel ways.

I will use the popular example of lab-grown meat; we are moving past the need for FBS, and the methods are getting more and more productive. I read in an article, the projection is we can create 20,000 pounds of beef from a cell collection. The implications of this are monumental, we could get to the point where we only need a small donor herd per region, the small size of this population will imensly reduce greenhouse gasses and will be easier to maintain these animals and provide them with an optimum quality of life; the only downside is being a relatively painless biopsy.

&amp;#x200B;

I suppose the crux of what I'm saying is that I think the exploitation of animal products can be done in an ethical way if certain parameters are met.

The movie does well to expose the financial interests of organisations such as Dolphin Safe and MSC is actually because they are funded by fishers. However, the film-maker is a long term vegan and made a vegan documentary before and even helped with Cowspiracy. Now that in itself isn't a problem, it is great, but it means I don't believe the ""aim of the journey"", so by him saying he didn't set off to make a documentary that shows the impact of eating fish seems untrue, maybe he did only want to make a film about plastic, but I would believe it more knowing he is a vegan filmmaker if he was honest that it was to show the impact of commercial fishing. I just feel anyone who looks into him, could think ""ah its more vegan propaganda by a vegan to guilt me into being vegan"".

It wasn't that big of an adjustment for me cuz I wasn't a huge meat eater anyway. Once I found good cheese I was set 😁 

He was always bereft w/o meat at a meal. FF to Nov last yr, he had a heart attack and now he's pretty much 100% produce, no more processed stuff at all. 

But lately we've been getting into stinks about ""making exceptions,"" I think b/c he feels like he's given up more than I. Ex: he started buying honey once the jar we had ran out (like 2 yrs old lol). I told him how it's not vegan, try agave, ""it's not the same! I'm using honey in my teas and that's THAT!""

He's always had fish tanks, but not for the last 10 yrs cuz we didn't have space. So 3-4 yrs ago we started thinking about it again (before we went vegan), made room for a nice aquarium, bought a cheap stand, spent MONTHS refinishing and fixing it, shopped for fish... Then other prioritie$ took over and we stopped for a while.

Now he's talking about it again, maybe a turtle (!), I'm telling him it's really not humane, etc, but ""I've always had fish, I love fish, what do we do with the tank now, blah blah blah."" Idk anymore, I don't want to fight anymore but we already have 2 dogs (stray/shelter) and a snake that I've had for maybe 20 yrs (he was a rescue and I won't have a pet snake again, but I don't trust someone else to adopt him)... but I can't argue that we won't have time b/c this is HIS thing, I have no idea about fish care.

How do I convince him pet fish aren't vegan? Are they less or moreso than dogs? We've been married 14 yrs and this isn't gonna make for a divorce or anything but it will take up a BIG part of our living room, a good chunk of $, and a long-term commitment.

I want to share how my lifestyle changed going vegan and how it gave me a new perspective about what we're eating and the overall picture with the current food chain. 

I also want to know what you're going to think about my perspective since I have in some ways different views for which I will get maybe downvoted but just hear me out. 

When I started college I started living on my own which meant that I had to cook for myself which I never did before moving out. I wanted to start experimenting a little with what I eat and my friend told me he was a Netflix documentary The Game Changers which I decided to give a try and try to avoid animal and dairy products on my plate. It started slowly but I stopped buying meat, then slowly getting rid of eggs, cheese, switched to plant-based milk. 

With this change, my teenage acne is 98% gone which was bad when I was in high school. Energy levels really boosted, I don't feel heavy when I finish my meal even if I fill myself completely, discovered so many ways of cooking and recipes.

After seeing this change I was reading more about how animal agriculture works and it was such an eye-opener how messed up the whole industry works and how I was uneducated about where does the food come from, what does it contain, how much nutrition it has, what's good and what's not, how many animals are killed. 

Coming from an Eastern Europe where meat is basically on a plate every second day it was quite a change, my family is still in confusion why the 'drastic' change but I won't be coming back to the eating habits because with the information I gained. 

Living in ignorance or unawareness about how my actions impact animals, the planet was, on one hand, blissful, because let's face it, everybody loves cheese, meat but it's not right at the expense of others, not in this era when we have so many substitutes and options to choose from and with the climate crisis.

But here's my second thought about it: if the animal industry and dairy industry operated in a more sustainable, moral way, I would support it. 

I grow up in a village my grandma had her own chickens whose eggs were incomparable with the ones available in supermarkets.  We also got a homemade cheese from one of her friends who got their own cows.

My belief is that if dairy, animal products were consumed once a month or just on special occasions and didn't take it for granted, we could reduce the suffering, global warming in a great way.

Right now in college, I am fully vegan, I read carefully what's on the label of the products I buy making sure no animal ingredients are in them.

However, when I come home for a few weeks I have to cheat because I am not the one cooking and my family always puts some milk, dairy into the food but I won't touch any meat they prepare. I can see that I made some positive impact on my family and friends as well, they started eating oats in the morning, tofu, soya chunks but they are not willing to transform their eating habits completely.

This guys blew the lid off this conspiracy and hopefully has caught a lot of people’s attention enough for more of us to make the change, because it’s a change that is 100% worth making.

Also a lot of people, myself included tend to avoid these documentaries because of how raw and sad they are.

Maybe if there’s a way for someone to summarise all the facts of the documentary without having to witness the pain and torture of these beings and make a post about it I think that might be a great idea.

Now not to say that veganism as an ideology is not worth criticism, but I keep getting videos recommended popping up in my FY page that play semantic games about veganism. Imagine if I said for example, ""everyone should donate to charity"" one would naturally assume that I am not including homeless and low income people. To assume or argue that this was the implication would clearly be a disingenuous assumption. But these are the same equivalence made about veganism on tiktok.

People are constantly implying that veganism is somehow colonialism. Trying to argue from a perspective of race that vegans are trying to use Imperialist ideologies to domineer oppressed cultures. Which I know that getting sustainable food is important and trying to buy food which was acquired using laborers who aren't abused financially is of course important to vegans. Most of us are deeply concerned not only about animal rights, but about human rights as well. Veganism as an ideology is altruistic in its essence. It really boggles me how people can argue that all we eat are quinoa and avocados, something that is very clearly exaggerated to seem as though we enjoy exploiting those in developing nations and their labour, but then ignore how their diet does the same. Most of the crops imported to and grown in the western world are used for the sake of the animal agricultural industry. This exploits the labour of the workers. Carnists use these arguments as if they themselves don't also consume the same products we do.

What angers me even more is they argue for example, that veganism is somehow racist to indigenous people and then ignore the destruction of the Amazon for animal agriculture, which is home to hundreds of indigenous tribes. Or how about the fishing industry which has fought tooth and nail, especially in Canada against the fishing rights of indigenous people, which in turn causes food insecurity? Not a peep. But they use their politics to try and instill an ideology that is based in false equivalencies. 

Wanna talk about discriminating towards people of low income? How about chicken farmers in the states who live at or below the poverty line because of industry abuses? Or maybe we should see low income communities like those in North Carolina who are predominantly Black, Native American and Latinos who live near CAFOs and are dying of diseases such as cancer caused by pollution from animal waste? Or how about the fact that the last 10 global pandemics have been caused by the animal food industry, which have disproportionate health outcomes for the people in the most empoverished communities? Or how about the fact that most of the world's lowest paying jobs are those of fast food workers? How about the fact that the animal agricultural industry is one one the highest sources of green house gas emissions in global warming which will harm the world most vulnerable communities as the global temperatures continue to rise? Anyone wanna mention any of that? Yet somehow veganism is exploitative and classist?

The fact alone that we have enough food on the planet to end world hunger, yet most of the world's crops go are used to feed livestock which go to feed the world richest nations is horrifying. This is somehow a reality we're all accustomed to and have collectively decided is ok. Somehow veganism is the problem.

Now as I mentioned earlier, problems in vegan food sourcing like any other diet are worth dicussing. Like migrant workers yielding crops at what is essentially slave labour is horrifying. But this is not an issue caused by veganism, nor will it be solved by attacking veganism. If there were no vegans, this would still be an issue as news flash, carnists also eat vegetables.

I am sick of the semantic games and I am sick of the accusations. Why are these issues only raised when the subject of veganism is brought up... I don't see these carnists advocating against exploitation until it suits their biases. Can we all agree that it is getting ridiculous?

Would you eat something that died of age, or a non transmittable disease, or an accident not intentionally caused. Something that experienced no intentional suffering or cruelty in it's life.

Here's an example. 
You get a pet chicken and you name her cluckerina
Every day you feed her, help her, play with her, love her
You love her and she loves you
Eventually after 10 years of having a great life, cluckerina dies peacefully

Would it be ethical to eat her. She wasn't suffering in life.

Easier:
- not craving meat and dairy

Harder
- finding sustainably packaged vegan substitutes for meat and dairy

Basically the idea behind meal kits is you get the ingredients for a certain number of meals (on average three) per week sent to you with a recipe card and you make them (they're marketed towards people who don't have much time to grocery shop and cook or who eat a lot of fast food). I personally keep the recipe cards in a binder so that I can make the ones I liked again. There are companies that offer vegan options and also one company (Purple Carrot) that is entirely vegan. 

The only downside is price tag - $7-10 per portion is quite a bit, so it's definitely a luxury for me and I don't order every week. 

Has anyone else tried these, or have similar ways to try out new vegan dishes that don't involve a separate trip to the grocery store and tons of leftover ingredients?

I agree with you guys! And I just had one question!! I didn’t even have an opinion on the question it was straight up just a question. some had an issue that everyone asks it but that doesn’t mean it’s invalid.

Another concern of mine is the consumption of soy. I'm male, and although the estrogen thing seems to be nonsense, I have heard that high levels of soy could lead to infertility, and since I'd like to have kids someday, I dont want to overdo it until I can do more research.

My best friend is the best vegan I have ever met. She is a vegan because that is what she morally believes is right, but she has never once tried to make me eat vegan even when I'm with her. I've had friends before that were vegans and whenever we're together they expect me to eat vegan and I do not give them a hard time about that because I understand that is their moral stance. When we're making pancakes together she makes hers vegan and she's like oh I almost forgot you're not vegan and you prefer it with eggs and she makes mine with eggs.

So I'm not kidding the most respectful vegan I have ever met. We have been friends for 5 years. That being said she has shown me some really yummy vegan food companies that have microwave meals that are delicious that I just actually like and when I'm with her sometimes I choose to eat vegan with her and she's shown me some really good recipes.

She's also British so her family has forced me to love tea and we were talking about tea and she's like well I make it this way with almond milk, but of course you'll probably be using regular milk so just use this much to make it just the way you like it at my house. And I was like oh my gosh you know what I think the tea would probably taste really good with almond milk instead of my dairy milk. I should definitely use almond milk, because it's also really good in and I listed a few other recipes that I use it in although I don't like drinking almond milk or using it in cereal.

Then suddenly I realized, and I called her on it, I'm like you are sneakily making me vegan! You are playing the long game and I respect that! You respect the fact that I'm not vegan so much that I feel the need to respect the fact that you're vegan more than I normally would and you're showing me how yummy it can be.

Basically, it *feels good* to project an image of being a radical, and to receive validation from others. It reassures our moral self-understanding. It helps our social lives; it lets us connect with others in our tribe. It doesn't take much effort for a white person to share a BLM article or even attend a rally; it doesn't make much effort for a man to talk about women's rights. There's cultural support for these stances; it doesn't take real conviction to get on board.

One the other hand, here we have this gargantuan atrocity-- billions of sentient beings systematically tortured and killed. They are being gassed and castrated and electrocuted, *all so we can literally eat their bodies for pleasure.* Three day old infants literally have their nuts sliced out screaming, and their dead bodies are sold. Anyone who thinks about it honestly for even 5 minutes knows it's pure evil. It's not even ""kind of bad""; it's at the level of the worst crimes in history. But most non-vegan leftists don't care enough to go vegan, or even to do the bare ass minimum of raising awareness.

Why? Because there isn't much of a personal pay-off in being anti-speciesist. You have to change your behaviors concretely (not just say the ""right"" things); you have to accept that you've been doing something wrong your whole life; and you have to go against the majority. There are real, tangible changes required of being a proponent of animal liberation, which you don't find with other causes. There's no bullshitting possible. You have to walk the walk.

The fact that most leftists willfully ignore something so patently horrendous has made me more and more cynical. I don't think most people truly reason out *why* they believe what they do. If people had a deeper understanding of *why* racism or sexism are wrong, philosophically, they'd be much more receptive to arguments against speciesism. But most of the time, I believe many people just instinctively conform to the norm. They don't reason themselves into core beliefs, but just absorb them from others. Heidegger has this concept of ""das Man"" (the They) which basically refers to an impersonal social reality or ""background of thought."" He says that we tend to live inauthentically, and just live passively accept the values of ""the They"" because ""that is what one does.""

I don't think I'm somehow about living inauthentically (no one is), and I don't blame non-vegans who honestly are ignorant. We were all their once. But pretty much everyone at this point knows that animals are tortured and killed for food. It's willful ignorance more anything else.

I love everything about being vegan. That is, everything but the fact that veganism is a thing at all. I'm with Earthling Ed on this - the worst thing about being vegan is that veganism is a 'thing' at all. 

Being surrounded by omnivores and speciesists on a day to day basis, having a stubborn omnivorous mum, being plagued by ads for animal products, constantly picking my battles and having to justify and educate.....it gets tiring. 

One thing I like to do is to watch videos aimed at non vegans and re-learn about the dairy industry etc to give myself a boost. 

But sometimes, it just feels exhausting and hopeless.

I guess I need a little support. I’ve been vegan nearly 2 years now and I’m struggling a bit, but I’m not sure why. I used to be a huge foodie and still am, I cook almost every meal we eat! Sometimes I think I miss the ease and extra variety that dairy products can add to dishes. Sometimes I wonder about being a vegetarian instead (meat has never been for me), but I know too much about the treatment of animals and the health detriments. 
I guess what I’m saying is, I know to much to go back, but sometimes I wish I could. Has anyone else struggled with this? What helped you?

I am a volunteer with the cat and dog rescue Crazy Cat Lady Rescues.

With kitten and puppy season coming up, we desperately need help. Though we consistently operate at max capacity, the demand is still so high. On every stray feeding route, we see multiple cats and dogs that need urgent shelter or emergency medical care. Moreover, we are constantly receiving calls from pet owners asking for help re-homing their pets. We will always do our best to help each of these cases, but we are currently drowning under the demand. That’s why I am reaching out again for your help.

We feed 250+ (and counting) dogs and cats in Rabat, Morocco. With all these mouths to feed, our food supply goes quickly. We urgently need to stock up on food for both the strays and the shelter animals. Moreover, we take in predominantly sick or injured cats, and our supply of medication is running out. We are worried that they will soon not be able to receive the treatment they need.

These animals need all of our help, and we can’t do this alone much longer. Please share or donate if you can. Follow the link below to visit our website and to see all of the ways you can help us help the animals!

Do you think humans artificially feeding wildlife is bad?  My new apartment has two balconies, and I've added both bird seed feeders, and hummingbird nectar feeders.  I love to see them stop by and visit.  Watching from behind glass in the safety and comfort of my apartment.  

I struggle sometimes, because I'm replacing what would be a natural diet, and I have no real understanding of how this is affecting them.  I believe I am using quality products, but I didn't make them myself, so I don't know.  They've been up for a year, and are very popular with the local bird community.

A hear a lot that vegan diets are boring, bland etc.
It's often difficult to respond to this as people making these claims likely have very little knowledge of food in general.

One question to ask these people could be: 
""You can have the best chefs in the world prepare you one dish, the dish may include either only ingredients suitable for a vegan, or only ingredients a vegan would not eat (meat, milk, eggs, honey etc). What meal do you choose?

I find it difficult to believe anyone would pick the later option, especially considering salt is a vegan ingredient.

The idea here is that meat dishes are heavily dependent on plants to derive nice flavour. And I thought this question is an interesting way to get people thinking about that.

We are graduate students in the M.S. Human-Computer Interaction program at Georgia Tech working on our capstone project. We've researched and designed an internal portal to improve the relationships between CSA Farmers and their customers, more specifically helping farmers share information about CSA boxes and farm updates with their customers.



Currently, we're trying to get feedback and insights from CSA customers about the portal through a 30-minute usability study. If you're a CSA customer, we'd love to hear your thoughts on the portal and how it would fit with your CSA farm. During the study, you'll be completing a list of tasks on the portal and describing how you feel about the portal. We'll be giving you a $10 Amazon gift card for your participation.

I've recently watched the Game Changers Documentary on Netflix and it opened my eyes to the benefits of a plant-based diet.

However, I'm looking for evidence to see how protein from fish, eggs and cheese affects inflammation?

So far I've only found studies that include people who are heavy meat eaters.

I wonder if there's any evidence how each animal-protein affects levels of inflammation (especially fish / eggs &amp; cheese).

Does anybody have some facts &amp; figures about that? Disclaimer: I'm really looking for studies, rather than personal opinions OR ethical discussion points. Thanks for understanding and respecting the purpose of this post!

You've framed the question in a sentimental point of view, but in nature, animals (+us) are simply meant to consume other animals. (or at least carnivores/omnivores) Nature isn't sentimental about this. Ever seen a lion ripping a gazelle apart?

In my 3 years of dealing with anxious, aggressive cats, I have never seen a cat behave like this. He truly thought that we were threatening his life, and reacted as such. We will both have to start antibiotics to protect ourselves against the depth and severity of my cats bites and scratches.

That being said - all I can think about is my cats poor little face when he realized who I was, and what he was doing. The fear in his giant pupils!

I am now contemplating on starting again. I have a more mature way of thinking about what I eat and I am lactose and gluten intolerant.

I have tried to look up pros and cons on the web and it seems more like each camp wants to shove an opinion rather than facts down the throat.

I am very scientific and very distanced from my own thoughts and opinions when researching a subject.

Are you strictly vegan or do you partake in some meateating at all ?

But before that cereal I had essentially done nothing special concerning iron since I became vegan in June 2017.

The fact that iron absorption is coupled so closely with your blood Vitamin C level is - I think - a key indicator of just how fundamentally important it is to be eating a wide range of plant foods.

For example, I was scrolling through reddit before bed last night, and I happened upon an extremely triggering image of animal abuse untagged in my front page. While I understand that this was not done as a prank or something but rather to spread awareness (and while there were comments suggesting it may be fake or out of context), this image was extremely graphic and immediately sent me into a panic attack, because it was so sudden and unexpected. I then spent the next few hours trying desperately to calm myself down, because while a panic attack itself doesn't last super long, the after effects do. 

This is just one specific and severe example. but I just feel like the constant discussion of animal abuse chips away at me mentally and emotionally. I makes me feel burnt out, and it makes me dread interacting with others.  I feel as though I don't have any friends anyways, and especially not vegan ones, so I feel extremely isolated.

I also just..dread having discussions about it with my family, because the people around me are the kind of people who literally will never get it (we are talking narcissistic family members). I feel like my home life plays into a lot of my mental state, but I feel like as well that I get burnt out easily from everything, especially because everything feels so fucked up and horrible. It feeds into my anxiety and depression, and while I watch everyone boast about how their mental state is only improving, I feel like in a way mine is deteriorating. Its a big reason why I haven't watched Dominion yet. I feel concerned that I'm in such a terrible headspace that it will only cause a more serious issue.

I want to stress that I don't think that eating vegan or refusing to consume animal product is causing this. I truly believe that my awareness is just another layer of the amount of shit that's gone wrong that I see every day.

Warning: This post contains descriptions of animal deaths.

**TLDR:** Someone's pet snake died before he could feed the snake a mouse. Now he doesn't know what to do with the mouse. If it becomes inevitable that he gets another snake, would it be preferable to rescue the little fella or to allow him to become the new snake's meal in place of a poor future mouse whose sale would benefit a scumbag rodent breeder?

**Full Post:**

I will first mention that I am a vegan of seven years and personally averse to rescuing obligate carnivores as long as humans are unable to supplant their diet with adequate alternatives to animal meat on a consistent basis. Until lab-cultured options are available, relying on roadkill or meat from animals culled by legal mandates leaves too much suffering to chance, and I would like to provide as little consumer demand as possible to industries that exploit animals. 

I have an uncomfortable scenario at hand. Until recently, someone I know would feed mice to a snake he kept as a pet. He kept one mouse at a time between feedings. Before the most recently purchased mouse could be delivered as a meal, the snake passed away. 

The former snake owner lives about 1000 miles away from me and does not want the mouse. He accepted my instinctive offer to find someone to adopt him. Unfortunately, he plans to adopt another snake to whom he will almost certainly feed mice. 

On one hand, I could save this mouse and feel good about having kept one innocent animal from being killed. On the other hand, I would probably only be swapping the life of this mouse for that of another one the human would buy from a rodent breeder, which would profit the mouse seller and create demand for his business. Should I save one mouse now at the expense of another later, or do I let him become food for the next snake in order to both save a future mouse from such a fate and avoid creating an incentive for this person to support the breeder in the future? 

Please pardon the jumble. This is keeping me up and my heart and my brain are at odds.

We currently live on the big island of Hawaii, and had just spent a wonderful day exploring since the place that did his shot was almost 2 hours away on the other side of the island. 

We tried a trendy, vegetarian restaurant that put honey mustard on the salad that we were going to share even though we specifically requested that it be made vegan and they assured us that that wouldn't be a problem. I didn't want to contribute more to the food waste problem though, so my husband, who is not vegan, decided that he would eat the salad. I decided not to let that get me down though and just enjoyed the rest of the food we ordered which was all very good.

Later we drove around a bit looking at some of the local shops and sights including a gorgeous waterfall, and then we headed home, by the time we got back to our side of the island, my husband was feeling hungry again, so he suggested that we pick up some food at panda express, which is not certified vegan due to cross contamination, I know, but does have the eggplant tofu and chow mein which are made with plant-based recipes, so I'm personally okay with eating there.

As we approach the restaurant though, my husband, who normally pays, gets a call from his mom, and asks me to go get the food, so he can take the call. Without thinking, I say, ""sure, what do you want?"", and I'm immediately overcome with dread because I realize that he's going to ask me to get him the teriyaki chicken and walnut shrimp, and then I start having a panic attack.

My husband, who picked up the call before he realized I was freaking out, told his mom that he would call her back later and ended the call quickly. He then asked if I was okay and if we still wanted to get food. I told him that I wasn't really hungry, and we drove home. We ended up skipping dinner altogether, and we haven't really talked about what happened.

I think the reason I started freaking out is because I had always had a degree of separation between his eating habits and my responsibility for them, but when he asked me to pick up (and thus pay for) his food. It was like I would be accepting personal responsibility for it. 

And while I don't believe that his choices are wholly my responsibility, I'm concerned that I haven't done enough to try to convince him to change, and I feel like I've been selfishly avoiding that conversation with him because it will be awkward and uncomfortable.

I’ve been vegan for almost 3 years. My family (mom, sister, and brother-in-law) were supportive at first but basically in the sense that they thought I had found a new hobby. As time has gone on, I have tried to talk to them about the realities of animal agriculture and the immense suffering. (They all call themselves animal lovers btw.) I’ve shared articles and videos, etc. and now it’s to the point where they ignore me. I don’t feel like I have bombarded them with information. I will share something once a month or so. But about 6 weeks ago, I shared an article about pig farming via group text and my sister hasn’t contacted me since, even though I’ve reached out to her several times since then about completely unrelated, benign topics. Last week mom agreed to watch Dominion with me. Before we started it, she went on and on for about 15 minutes about a stray cat she had taken to an animal shelter recently and about how she was appalled that the shelter released the cat back into the neighborhood several days later (in 20 degree weather) to fend for himself, because they said the cat most likely belonged to someone in the neighborhood and in their experience, this was the best way for the cat to make his way back home. This horrified me too, that an animal shelter would deal with an animal this way, but that’s not my point. My point is that after this discussion about the cat (and how disgusted she was with their handling of the cat), my mom and I proceeded to watch Dominion. She didn’t bat an eye. She wasn’t bothered or disturbed at all by the sheer terror and fear that was evident in the animals’ eyes and faces and the horrible suffering that way shown. She actually started to doze off in the middle of it but I woke her up. I’ll bet if I were to ask her right now what she learned about the dairy industry from that film, she wouldn’t be able to tell me anything. She told me before we watched it that it wasn’t going to change her mind. I asked her to just please watch and listen with an open mind and be willing to learn something. I think she just tuned it out and didn’t listen to any of the narrative and assumed that the footage she was seeing was from isolated cases, not the norm. I love my family but I’m having an extremely hard time dealing with the hypocrisy and the blatant unwillingness to learn how their food ends up on their plate.  It’s definitely causing a rift but I don’t know how to be ok with it. I tell them what I have learned and they just don’t care. If it were about any other topic or injustice, they would be receptive. They just literally refuse to discuss this with me or learn anything. I can’t stand it. It’s like, if you know me and love me and are close to me, then be open to what I’m trying to share with you and show you about what I’ve learned about the horrors of animal agriculture. I feel like they would rather cling to their “right” to eat animal products than to take me seriously. This doesn’t make me want to stay in contact with them. We were so close before; why won’t they trust that maybe what I’m trying to share with them is real?

Personally the avocado thing isnt too important to me as i focus on non human animals but the other 3 affect animals which is unfortunate since many of the vegan processed items contain those items as ingredients

About four years ago, one of our family members was diagnosed with an illness; instead of resorting to incorporating the prescribed medication for a lifetime, we decided to go vegan as a family to help support the transition to heal with food, as opposed to medication. Within the first few months, contrary to the medical advice received at the time, all signs of the illness disappeared, and our family fully adopted the vegan lifestyle for health purposes ever since.

As the years went by, many other aspects of our lives changed. Naturally, we began to become more aware of the products we were using and their impact on our bodies as well as the environment, but one of the biggest impacts adopting a vegan lifestyle has had for me personally, was the dissolution of the concept that we, as a species, are superior to others.

Driving home on the highway the other afternoon, a duck was sitting on the asphalt road just about a foot away from the median. As cars drove by, the drivers would move over and continue their journey. The highway was two lanes, one way with a 50 MPH speed limit. There was a man-made river with a pond about a quarter mile away where the ducks spend their time; I pulled over to see if I could help take her to safety.

I approached the duck and put my hand out to let her know I was there to help. One of her feet sticking out, but I couldn’t see any other signs of injury. She let me pick her up without any fear. I carried her to the pond and placed her beside the water, to let her decide whether she wanted to swim or rest.

I sat down next to her and spent about 20 minutes by her side until her eyes started to relax and her head slowly doze off; as I began to realize what was happening I sang her a song about the graceful life she must have lived at the pond. I sang until she passed, and immediately broke down in tears. I found so much relief in knowing this small act of compassion allowed her to spend the remainder of her time at home, beside the lake, under the shade and in the company of her family as opposed to a hot asphalt road with massive machines roaring by her every moment, until her last moment.

Being vegan has had many positive impacts on my life, but more than anything I am grateful for having been gifted the clarity to understand the vast amount of similarities we share with all other forms of life, to embrace the connection to our planet, its landscape and all of its inhabitants – we are all one and the same

Now, it's of course no one's *job* to recall this fact about me. (I'm not *that* important, alas.) I can use my words to inform people who need to know. 

But having to remind the same people over and over again is annoying, and sometimes invalidating.  

If my friend or family member were allergic to nuts, they would not have to tell me twice, and I would not subject them to nuts. If they were undergoing a spiritual fast, I would avoid talking about and eating food around them. 

Given the uncontested importance of such things, it seems only decent--but again, not obligatory--to know these things. It doesn't take up that much mental real estate. 

Sometimes, when non-vegan people who know me fairly well say this to me, it sounds awfully disingenuous--as disingenuous as it would sound to them if I said to them, say, ""Sorry, I forgot you ate meat."" 

(By the way, the same people tend to feel annoyed when you tell them you're vegan--as if remembering that fact wouldn't circumvent that.)

I'm speculating here, but sometimes I can't help but think the aim is delegitimize a lifestyle commitment by deeming it utterly forgettable.

I just recently started seeing a really, amazing guy. It’s only been 2 weeks but things seem to be going really well. 
Some quick context: when I told him I was vegan he was very good about it, didn’t get defensive, didn’t try to argue stupid things. He did, unfortunately, use the classic “in my culture, every meal needs meat” thing, but that’s something I can work with as we go lol. We’ve talked about cooking food together and he’s down for eating my cheese etc. (Some really good green flags IMO!) 
However, my issue is watching him choose and eat meat and dairy etc. We went out to get food the other night, he got pizza, and ordered.... meatlovers...... I felt my mood immediately drop and he could see it in my face. I’m sure you all have felt the same, we see the meat and can’t help thinking about the animal. I had to work really really hard in my brain to be able to stop thinking about the pizza and move on to have a good night with him. 

My question is to those of you who are currently with a SO who is not vegan, how do you mentally manage your mood and feelings when eating together?? Do you have any tactics to keep you out of that sadness? What works for you?

However, this is the second time it has made me sick. I have acid reflux issues, so it wouldn’t surprise me in the slightest if the fat content was the culprit. 
Impossible meat has never been part of my regular diet because it’s not healthy... like at all. The high protein content/no cholesterol claim are about the only things going for it. 
It’s the perfect substitute for the classic American diet because there are 14 grams of fat per 4oz. It feels heavy on your stomach and is very filling. Plus, it tastes like meat, cooks like meat, etc. 

I ate it last night and I ate too much of it, so I woke up at 5am with nausea/stomach pain &amp; heartburn. 
I’ve eaten it dozens of times over the last 3 years and it’s only made me sick twice, but I think that’s enough for me to swear off it for now.

I was unexpectedly intrigued by what Melanie called ""Witnessing"" in the above book, which if I interpreted it correctly sounded like activism or would you say they are different? I found this part interesting, because I have never been much of an 'activist', because I don't get emotionally riled up very easily and don't enjoy the feeling either--nothing wrong with that, it is just not my demeanor. However, the way she described it as ""witnessing"" was very interesting to me. She cited three simple things you can do to witness if I recall correctly:

1. Eat as vegan as possible
2. Join a vegan society/advocacy group(Second bullet above)
3. Share/Educate others about veganism and carnism

This appealed to me, because it sounded like I could be an advocate or witness by doing the above items plus educating people or just talking to others about veganism and much to my relief she says you can do it even if you are not the perfect vegan yourself (phew! I'm trying!😅).

I'm new to this subreddit, I read the rules but I'm sorry if it's a bit vague.. hope not?? :( Unintentional, sorry! 

Hi! I'm a 14-year-old girl, and I've been vegetarian pretty much all my life. I was basically forced into it by my parents (Indian brahmins, while some brahmins from other parts of India do eat meat, the brahmins from where I'm from almost rarely do... I'm one of them) because of a) yes, the religion we are a part of (Hinduism) and b) my mom genuinely loves animals and cares for them greatly, doesn't want us consuming any meat for that reason. In fact, it's probably more because of that than anything else but also definitely religious reasons. But not here to talk about religion and my random reasons. for being vegetarian, sorry! But we are vegetarian, not vegan. Thought I should just give a bit of backstory

I've kind of wanted to be vegan for a while though! I feel like I will be healthier (I had a dairy allergy, not lactose intolerance but a dairy allergy that I seemed to have grown out of (?) just when I was maybe 12 years old. So I kind of already couldn't consume dairy or I'd break out in hives and shit) But yeah, I feel like I'd be healthier in that sense. I do consume egg, might be a bit hard to break out of but I think I can get through it! But as my mom's reasons for being vegetarian, I also just care a lot for animals and don't want to engage or assist in the bad practices in any way. 

I just had a few questions if there's anyone here who is vegetarian and wanting to be vegan and then became vegan! I'll phrase this better xD : vegetarian to vegan folks here? 

1) If you guys were around my age (teenagers) when you made the change, does it have any effects on your body and stuff? As in I am still growing, haven't hit puberty yet (I have a few medical conditions that are fairly serious, that might be why) but I don't think that it would have any negative effects as opposed to what already is there? As in let me explain this better: I eat eggs with hormones and shit and whatever they put in them already, if you guys have been in the same situation with going vegan did this negatively affect your body in any way? I'm not too concerned as it's just veganism but just to be sure. 

2) Also for teens my age when you made the switch, did you guys cook your own meals? Or have someone cook it for you somewhere else? I guess aside from egg/cheese/milk, as I'm vegetarian I basically just eat rice and veggies all day every day anyways, I suppose that would be vegan? But just wondering if you guys made any new foods on your own or your parents or whatever made them for you still. 

3) One more question, do you guys take any supplements for any nutrients you might be missing? I'm not asking about how to get B-12 in your diet or anything like that (I've already been taking B-12 supplements for a year or so as it is) just wondering if you guys take any supplements. As in, any gummy vitamins or anything like that, maybe calcium or whatever if you guys already do that? 

&amp;#x200B;

:( I'm sorry if I broke any of the FAQ questions or anything, don't think I did! Thank you guys! I just want to try to get into veganism because I do feel like since I rarely eat dairy anyway as it still fucks me over a tiny bit, and I do care about the well being then veganism would be a good solution since I'm kind of ""halfway"" there with being vegeatarian.

(Tw: ED) I’ve been a proud vegetarian for 8 or 9 years now. I already don’t consume a ton of milk bc I’m lactose intolerant. I’ve struggled quite a bit with my relationship to food. I developed an eating disorder around 5 years ago. Although I’ve wanted to go completely vegan, in order to recover from my ED I had to stop analyzing everything I did and ate. Now I’m doing really great. I’m back to a healthy weight, I work out to gain muscle/stay healthy (rather than lose weight), and I’m starting to cook/bake more! I have the time and resources to finally go vegan but I have to be extremely cautious and take it slow. Oh, and last thing you should know- I am TERRIBLE at cooking. Absolutely awful. So I’ll definitely need advice on how to keep things as simple as possible. 

Okay, so on to my questions. (You don’t have to answer all of them or u can just give me random advice) 

•What are some must have vegan ingredients?
•How do you avoid disordered eating? (If you’ve had an ED before)
•What are some good vegan food brands?
•Do you take vitamins or supplements? If so, what?
•What are some tips you have to keep things simple?
•How do you deal with dietary constraints while eating out or traveling?
•Whats your favorite part about being vegan?
•How did you start eating vegan?
•And just any good old advice you have for me

I rediscovered and matched with a friend from elementary/high school on Tinder a couple of months ago. Idk if they like me back or not but I’m stupid in love with them and I live to please people. We’ve gone to the park, played with our dogs together, they invited me to a party (where they got drunk and called me hot a bunch lmao 😳), etc. I had asked them to be my valentine and they said yeah but platonically which is cool but confusing because they swiped on me and also called me hot. So basically, I’m getting mixed signals. 

I’m a vegan, and they’re pescatarian, and I still love them lol, and I made them a whole vegan lasagna because they were really busy one week with a new job. Then I made them vegan cookies just because. This week they cancelled some plans we wanted to make to hang out, which makes me even more confused but they said they were having mental health problems so I understand. No worries. I told them I’d make them a care package. I want to make them some food and some dessert for their care package. 

Now here’s the problem: I try looking up “what food to make for someone feeling depressed” or whatever, but I only get “TOP TEN EASY SIMPLE OK ENOUGH MEALS TO COOK FOR YOURSELF WITH MINIMAL EFFORT WHEN YA GOT BIG SAD”. And when I try to think of comfort food ideas I only get very non-vegan stuff coming to mind, or something ridiculously romantic that I’m way too shy to present (a cake? Like are we getting married or something? lmao) or something I know would be subpar to a non-vegan (yes yes silken tofu but does vegan cheesecake actually compare?). 
 
I’m depressed too, but for this person I would wake up early and invent a vegan crème brûlée. I would sculpt them an oat milk ice cream statue or even learn what ‘leavening agent’ means. I would buy name-brand Beyond beef where I wouldn’t even buy Daiya cheese for myself, and if they just wanted to be friends I would still do it a hundred times again with no regret.

So I said that if they had to list half of the hormones and antibiotics they pump cows full of on the ingredients list of the meat she buys it would be twice as long.

Anyways, she used every single argument with me that I thought she would, and was full on yelling at me and interrupting me and talking about how much she loves ""juicy steaks"" and how I was making her feel bad about herself.

My friend decided to follow her. 

Occasionally the Mother hen would stop and turn around to make sure she was being followed, clucking away.

Finally my friend saw it, her toddler had made his way all the way to the edge of the farm, stuck in a fence, on the other side of the fence... a very busy highway.

So they're selling this product to food manufacturers and it looks like there are three ice cream brands on the market that use the ingredient. Soon it looks like there will be yogurt and cheese, which I am so pumped for!

I don't step outside of my house because I see cruelty everywhere. I get almost everything home-delivered, yes that has got a lot of plastic accumulated. 

I contribute most of my life savings to animal shelters still I cannot get peace of mind. I don't even use palm oil products because I want to be as minimalistic as possible.

While I do find it interesting, I began questioning it from the perspective of vegan philosophy; a quick search has shown that while bugs can feel acute pain ( nociception), I could not find any concrete evidence that they are sentient beings. So if entomophagy could potentially reduce the dependency on meat, would you say that it would morally be okay to raise bug farms? Or would it still be labeled as animal cruelty?

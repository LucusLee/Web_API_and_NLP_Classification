Nellie/ Amla is found naturally in tropical and subtropical South Asian arid regions and mixed evergreen forests. It originates in the southern Himalayas of Nepal, from the northern part of India to the southern part of the Indian subcontinent. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Medicinal properties 

 Ayurveda points out that Nellie contains all the flavors except salt. It contains the five flavors of sweet, acid, thorn, bitter and decoction. Nellie can be described as an equally beneficial medicine to alleviate the triads of va, pit and sem. 

 Nellie is also very good for pregnant mothers and helps to get rid of many complications during pregnancy. 

Nellie helps maintain normal levels of hormones in the liver, restores liver cells, controls cancer and inflammation, and maintains proper function throughout the body. Nellie is a good medicine to prevent allergies, improve body strength and strengthen the pulse, develop intelligence and control aging. Nellie is also good for dental disease. Nellie can also be used to reduce obesity and burn fat, as well as a remedy for gastrointestinal problems. Nellie also helps lower blood sugar levels.

Nellie is good for improving eyesight and alleviating eye diseases and also prevents premature graying of hair. Eating one or two Nellie nuts daily can help you to have a healthy glow-free hair as well as a healthy, dry skin. Nellie also contributes to the health of the hair as well as the scalp. Nellie will help you save the huge amount of money you spend on a variety of chemical ointments and medications, as well as get better results without side effects. Nellie is good for all the organs of a healthy person from head to toe.

Nellie tea is a hot drink made with Nellie powder. Nowadays, these herbal drinks are available in the market as standardized high quality products and it is commendable that these herbal drinks can be easily used instead of tea for the health of your life in a busy lifestyle. You can now use high acid antioxidant tea to burn unwanted fat and maintain a healthy body weight, as a natural beauty treatment and as a natural drink that is good for all the organs of the body. That Nellie tea drink is one of the easiest ways to add the amazing nutritional properties of Nellie to your body.

Both my parents immediately said what a horrible idea it is. But they followed that up by saying “but we totally support you.”

I started off by talking about the footage I’d seen and how it disturbed me. My dad said how that sort of thing was propaganda and designed to provoke a reaction, and he doesn’t wanna see me get “manipulated” by it. I said that if reality was provocative, that’s a problem. He said “that’s why you don’t wanna know how the sausage gets made. Literally. There’s no way to ethically feed billions of people.” 

My mom then said that the only reason humans are human is because our ancestors ate meat, and that we owe our advanced brains to animal protein. My dad said that it’s hard to be healthy while being vegan.

Then both my parents started talking about how the animals we consume are treated humanely before they die and how they’re killed just as humanely.

After telling me what a horrible idea it is to go vegan, my mom said “but look how much I already support you! I’ve been making plant based meals every now and then, and I buy so many vegetables!” She then said how most vegans are super unhealthy because they’re “junk-food vegans”, and that if I did go vegan “one day”, she’d make sure I wasn’t “one of those vegans”. I told her I’d be an adult by then and I wouldn’t need my mother choosing my food for me. I felt like the conversation wasn’t going anywhere so I walked off.

As I was leaving, my mom said “jeez. Was there a script you wanted me to read off of? I’m sorry I didn’t say what you wanted me to.”

Naturally I came back and told her that wasn’t what was going on, I just regretted saying anything to begin with and felt like we weren’t getting anywhere. I gave in and said I’d just wait to go vegan until after I left home.

She said “fine. Believe me, I can’t *wait* to stop cooking for you. Only two more years of this. I can’t wait.” I said “no one is forcing you to cook for us.” And I left, feeling like shit.

I’m pretty sure I heard them talking about me after I left. I don’t see why they can’t just accept my decision. It doesn’t effect them at all. It would have been one thing if I had asked them for their input, but I didn’t ask, I just told them what my decision was and they immediately started criticizing it. I’m 16 and can choose what I want to put into my body.

What are y’all’s thoughts on what happened? Did I do something wrong?? Why do I feel like shit??? I just don’t want to ignore what’s happening to animals and to our planet, and they’re making me feel like I’m crazy for it, and like the only reason I feel this way was because a documentary manipulated me into it.

One of my earliest memories is from when I was 3ish years old. I was playing on our patio and saw a lady bug. I remember wanting to see what would happen if I squished it.

Idk I knew it would squish but I think that I thought it would flatten and pop back up like in a cartoon. I took a plastic picnic table we had and crushed the ladybug. I still remember the sound. And when I picked the table up it was crushed and not moving. And it didn't pop back and I realized I had killed it.

That's as far as I remember but apparently I screamed really loud and my mom ran out because she literally thought I was being kidnapped or something. I was so inconsolable that I had hurt the lady bug... And clearly it was more than just childish overdramatization considering it's like my first memory. 

Idk it just makes me think that if we could let kids make their own choices they would never eat meat. It isn't in our nature to want to hurt animals at all. I also wanted to stop eating meat when I was a bit older and realized that people ate ducks and that the chicken I ate was animal parts...

My family wants to go vegan. We own 6 chickens and I have questions. I saw something on a different page that basically said I was a monster for owning chickens. Let me give some info and then you tell me if I’m evil😂

I adopted a friend’s chickens last summer. They were getting ready to move and couldn’t find a home for them so they were going to kill them and eat them. I was mortified so I took them in. They get tons of veggies, fruit, snacks, love, safety from local predators, space to roam, and access to their eggs for days at a time in case they need the nutrients from their eggs that they would normally eat in the wild. Whatever is leftover we’ve always eaten or shared with neighbors. They’re super friendly and come up to you for love and treats.

One person said that they should be set free but I can 100% promise you they would die in the wild.

Is it wrong to eat the leftover eggs that the chickens don’t eat themselves? Obviously you’re not vegan then, but at least your not supporting factory farming. Sooooo am I evil? Lol taking care of them and getting to know their little personalities has been so amazing and eye-opening.

I want to go vegan but my partner's family is from China; I worry that when I go vegan, I won't be able to connect with them and their culture very well. I want to learn how to make vegan versions of traditional Chinese food, although I have some allergies that make it pretty difficult to do substitutions. I'm hoping that if I have a whole book of recipes to choose from there'll have to be something I can eat!

Any ideas for books to check out are greatly appreciated! I do also appreciate individual recipes if that's all you know of, but it will be hit or miss if I'm able to have it.

My allergies are soy (yeah I know that's tough for Chinese food but I'm figuring out quite a lot of substitutes!), eggplant, avocado, yeast, garlic, and this isn't an allergy but I can't have wheat due to my Crohn's disease. Ginger also messes with me sometimes because of my Mast Cell Activation Syndrome, but it's not consistent. Yeah this is quite the list, I know. Hence why I'm struggling. I'm hoping I can at least find 2-3 recipes that I can adapt to meet my restrictions!

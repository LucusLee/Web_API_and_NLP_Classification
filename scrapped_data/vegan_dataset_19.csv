I'm approaching my two year anniversary soon and it's at least a start to help with my conscience about my diet prior to making the switch.

Two years ago today I still ate dairy. I was still complicit in the torture and exploitation of poor dairy cows. Some if not many of those cows are probably still alive today and continue to suffer, so I still feel complicit in what is happening to them because while I no longer fund what is happening to them *now*, I was responsible for the demand that ultimately lead to them being bred into existence in the first place.

Only after 5-6 years after going vegan will no dairy cow suffer due to my past choices. Because they've been murdered. But I feel it's actually somewhere around 20 years, or the life expectancy of a cow, when the debt can even begin to be repaid. I paid for a life born into slavery and I paid for a premature death.

Man, it's been a journey.  I gave up meat (and always had to specify that it included poultry and fish) in 2007.  I went vegan in April of 2013, and haven't looked back.  This month marks eight years of veganism.  In the last eight years, veganism has come a long way.  I went from having a couple of insta-foods that I could buy at the local chain grocer to having an exponentially growing number of items that I seem to be able to have.  The irony, of course, is that I eat a lot healthier these days and don't buy most of the new products that are on the market on any sort of regular basis.  I do my best to try a fair few of them, though, just to see what they're like.

Just setting an example for people has gotten people thinking, and my partner completely made the transition to veganism last summer.  This movement seems to only be beginning.

**I dedicate this post to all of the vegans who were doing it before I was, paving the way to make it a hell of a lot easier for me and everyone else these days.**

When I politely called her out on it and laid down a boundary saying that it's not okay to make me the butt of jokes about my lifestyle, she gave a totally transparent BS apology saying that she ""respected"" my choices and that it was just a ""lighthearted tease"".

Let me be clear that I do not talk about my veganism unless someone else brings it up, and I have never suggested to her that I disapprove of her choice to eat meat. Literally have never, ever gone there with her. 5 years I've known her, 1 1/2 of them as a vegan.

I followed up with her privately saying that I appreciated the apology, but that there was no valid reason to tease me for not eating animals. That respect and teasing aren't compatible in my view. That as a lifelong vegetarian I've been the butt of thousands of similar jokes and that they were the source of some childhood trauma and abusive behavior by people I thought were my friends. That her words really hurt me and were confusing in the context of an otherwise positive and supportive relationship. I sent her [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/28/opinion/vegan-food.html). I told her that I hoped she could empathize and hoped that this additional context could strengthen our relationship. 

As a progressive gay feminist of color, I thought she'd be able to empathize. All I got back?

I'm honestly gobsmacked. I didn't exactly expect ""love and light"", but that curt, empty, icy 3-word reply was not on my possibility list. The fact that it came from a grown-ass woman in her late 30s. The difference between how she handled the convo in private vs in front of her family. The total disregard of me basically pouring my heart out to her. It hurts. It confirms my previous suspicions about her being vapid and self-centered at her core.

But I know that her reaction isn't about me, and I know that this interaction is really a blessing because she showed me her true colors, both who she is and how she really sees me (and by extension my husband, her brother).

Really liked drum sticks until you bit a blood vessel and you can’t look at chicken nuggets the same way? 

Did you know that sausage are sometimes made using pig intestines? Ewwwwww so gross that when an animal is eaten all of it at least gets fucking used rather than thrown away to rot for its suffering. Hahahah yeah right gross. 

You used to eat cheese all the time, yum how could you live without it right, none of that stinky stuff though hahaha gross mould am I right? Then one day you left you’re really expensive cheddar at the back of the fridge and part of it froze and the other part went all fuzzy after you got back from holiday.

You just don’t like dairy and think it’s gross now that you know puss gets in it? That a stupid reason, it was just as puss filled when you last had it. 

You just think that killing an animal is icky, no problem with the death of its desire to live, it’s poor living conditions, is being a product, no no no just that killing is icky.

Moving out is not an option on the short term (perhaps in a year or so, but definitely not sooner than that).

The main problem is that my roommates do not want to adjust their cooking to my dietary preferences; whereas vegetarian was not really a problem to them (I'd just get a meat substitute alongside my veggies), cooking vegan meals is something they find 'too complicated' because it requires more adjustments. I also do not feel comfortable asking them to take my relatively new dietary preferences into account, because they already mock me whenever they see me drinking non-dairy milk (""oAtS hAvE fEeLiNgS tOo"") and they constantly try to debate me, while obviously not taking my arguments seriously (which is a whole other problem on its own, really).

Just take the best vegan cheese you can find Vio Life Mozarella blocks and Parmesan Powder works. Other good brands are Daiya and Green Vie.

Basics.

1. Grate it yourself
2. Add the Parmesan
3. Add small amounts of almond milk.
4. Heat on low and turn to sauce at desired level
5. Use as you want to

The way this works is melting vegan cheese evaporates the water and makes it taste bad so hydrating it helps prevent it worsening and improves texture flavour and use.

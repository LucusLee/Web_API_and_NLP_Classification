My partner has reluctantly agreed to watch a vegan documentary with me this evening, but now I'm feeling the pressure to show the perfect film. What do you think will be the most effective? 

I think it would be best to focus on the ethical arguements before going onto environmental ones in another film another time. Earthlings is the only vegan documentary I've seen, or at least was able to watch up to a certain point. The problem that I have with Earthlings is that it opens with the pets segment, which I personally find one of the most distressing parts, but my partner already agrees in adopting animals, so I'm concerned we may not make it to the segment on animals used for food, which is the main bit I want us to see. There's also the issue with the footage being older and I believe mainly from the US, which opens up for false rationalisations that the scenes are irrelevant to our situation. The other documentaries I know of are Dominion and Land of Hope and Glory, which I think would be good since it's set in the UK where we are, but I'm not sure.

Let me give you an example: I consider ""Forrest Gump"" as one of the greatest movies ever made. The story, characters and music are just phenomenal. But since I stopped eating animals, I just hate the whole Shrimp Boat arc, especially the scene where they start catching them big time. I think it is safe to assume that those were real shrimps and not just props. Would it make a difference? I mean, I had no problems killing whales in AC: Black Flag as I had no problems with killing humans there, too.

Now of course I know that this world is not vegan, the people I interact with and I rely upon aren't vegan (well most of them aren't), and most (song)writers and movie makers aren't either, and I still like their products. And I'm not really someone who needs a ""safespace"" to escape from this (not judging if someone does!), but scenes like the one I mentioned are just reminders that most people who watch them don't even consider this wrong or something.

They also list, separately, ""vegan natural flavors"".  So, I called them.  

The rep I spoke to told me he was a 40 year vegan, that they were vegan certified (after watching seaspiracy, I am even more skeptical of ""certifications""), and that it was probably a misprint, and also that he would send an email to someone to figure out the mistake and correct it. 

All great, until I asked him to contact me with the particulars of his findings.  As in, what is the difference between natural flavors (read: chicken) and vegan natural flavors; and why they listed both. I am no dummy, I have been doing this for 35+ years. It is well known in the vegan community that 'natural flavors' is a massive red flag. Labeling laws are there for a reason, and companies do their best to hide information that might appear off-putting to potential consumers. And packaging isn't cheap - companies need to buy a minimum of 80,000 lots to get a small break on the printing of plastic; to not proofread ahead of time with this large of scale seems a bit off. 

So, this is where the rep seemed to get defensive: ""can you email or call me when you find out what is going on with the labeling?"" response: "" I already cleared that up.""  I pressed him a little more, and realized that he was not being cooperative and that I was wasting my time.  he cleared up that I was confused, which is bs, because the confusing label is why I called in the first place. 

I have NEVER seen labeling like this ever. There is a reason they listed flavorings twice, with 2 different headings.  I am not sure why. What are 'natural vegan flavors', ground up vegans?  the packaging says vegan, but there is no sign anywhere of an oversight body, company, or whoever declared them to be vegan. certified by whom, exactly? 

I really want to believe the rep I spoke with, but the defensive posturing and refusal to clear up the confusion - or rather write it off as "" probably a packaging mistake"" and refusing to follow up smells like trouble.  If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, is labeled like a duck, and tastes like a duck...

The [Vegan Hacktivists](https://veganhacktivists.org) are working on a reddit bot using machine learning/AI which can be called to respond to debunk certain vegan myths. 

# Hasn't this been done before? 
It has indeed! [/u/YourVeganFallacyBot was created a couple years ago]( https://reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/igyqbq/two_years_ago_i_created_the_yourveganfallacybot/) 

Sadly, this bot has gone inactive as it required the creator to manually approve all posts.

/u/animalsupportbot will use MUCH more sophisticated methods of detecting vegan myths with the aim of running completely autonomously. This bot can be summoned to respond to any vegan myth you see on reddit, drastically reducing the time vegans take to respond to run of the mill arguments.

# We need your help! 
## Labelling 
Although the bot is in a semi-working state right now with no training data, we really want this bot to perform better, and to do that, we need some reddit comments to be labelled. We've scraped around 18k comments from /r/antivegan and /r/exvegans and put them in a [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NDue0zd00dYg0uaygXieDAJqFan4h1rSrNidQKQVz8A/edit#gid=0) for us to collaboratively label. For each comment in the spreadsheet, we'd like you to pick the myth that it belongs to, along with picking out the key sentence that the bot should be picking up on in response to that argument. 

[Please watch this short and simple instructional video before you begin!](https://streamable.com/qgjs59) 

In most cases, the comments will be ""N/A"", but for the ones which do fit into the categories listed, please select  the ENTIRE relevant sentence(s) to copy into the ""Key Sentence(s)"" column. For example, if the comment is:  `I'm not sure. The problem is, how do you know plants don't feel pain too?` the key sentence should be  `The problem is, how do you know plants don't feel pain too?`   (Note that this includes the pre-amble `The problem is`) 

## Arguments/Responses
If you think the bot should really be responding to a myth/argument which isn't present in the line-up we have currently, please post here for suggestions! If you're willing to write responses too, that would also be a great help. 

# Can I test it out now? 
Yes! You can check and test out how well it's working right now in the test subreddit [/r/testanimalsupportbot](https://reddit.com/r/testanimalsupportbot/).  It will respond to any comment in this subreddit when called, so feel free to play around with it! It's good to bear in mind that this is an extremely early prototype with essentially no training data, so expect some strange behaviour. (Note: Currently it only responds to comments, not top level text posts.) 

# How does animalsupportbot work? 
This is still an area which we have a good deal of flexibility in, but right now, it uses pretrained semantic embeddings generated from a neural network. If that term doesn't mean much to you, essentially a neural network calculates a vector which summarises any input text, such as a sentence from a comment.  We then compare this vector representation of the input text to every argument that we can respond to. If the input text and our argument are very similar, we pick out the counter argument and respond to the comment. TL;DR - Machine Learning Magic âœ¨ðŸ¤–âœ¨ 

# What arguments can it respond to? 
Currently it can respond to 30 vegan argument/myths outlined by everyone's favourite internet Vegan activist [Earthling Ed](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVRrGAcUc7cblUzOhI1KfFg) (and the responses are taken from his book/[vegancheatsheet.org](https://vegancheatsheet.org/)):

The [Vegan Hacktivists](https://veganhacktivists.org) are working on a reddit bot using machine learning/AI which can be called to respond to debunk certain vegan myths. 

# Hasn't this been done before? 
It has indeed! [/u/YourVeganFallacyBot was created a couple years ago]( https://reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/igyqbq/two_years_ago_i_created_the_yourveganfallacybot/) 

Sadly, this bot has gone inactive as it required the creator to manually approve all posts.

/u/animalsupportbot will use MUCH more sophisticated methods of detecting vegan myths with the aim of running completely autonomously. This bot can be summoned to respond to any vegan myth you see on reddit, drastically reducing the time vegans take to respond to run of the mill arguments.

# We need your help! 
## Labelling 
Although the bot is in a semi-working state right now with no training data, we really want this bot to perform better, and to do that, we need some reddit comments to be labelled. We've scraped around 18k comments from /r/antivegan and /r/exvegans and put them in a [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NDue0zd00dYg0uaygXieDAJqFan4h1rSrNidQKQVz8A/edit#gid=0) for us to collaboratively label. For each comment in the spreadsheet, we'd like you to pick the myth that it belongs to, along with picking out the key sentence that the bot should be picking up on in response to that argument. 

[Please watch this short and simple instructional video before you begin!](https://streamable.com/qgjs59) 

In most cases, the comments will be ""N/A"", but for the ones which do fit into the categories listed, please select  the ENTIRE relevant sentence(s) to copy into the ""Key Sentence(s)"" column. For example, if the comment is:  `I'm not sure. The problem is, how do you know plants don't feel pain too?` the key sentence should be  `The problem is, how do you know plants don't feel pain too?`   (Note that this includes the pre-amble `The problem is`) 

## Arguments/Responses
If you think the bot should really be responding to a myth/argument which isn't present in the line-up we have currently, please post here for suggestions! If you're willing to write responses too, that would also be a great help. 

# Can I test it out now? 
Yes! You can check and test out how well it's working right now in the test subreddit [/r/testanimalsupportbot](https://reddit.com/r/testanimalsupportbot/).  It will respond to any comment in this subreddit when called, so feel free to play around with it! It's good to bear in mind that this is an extremely early prototype with essentially no training data, so expect some strange behaviour. (Note: Currently it only responds to comments, not top level text posts.) 

# How does animalsupportbot work? 
This is still an area which we have a good deal of flexibility in, but right now, it uses pretrained semantic embeddings generated from a neural network. If that term doesn't mean much to you, essentially a neural network calculates a vector which summarises any input text, such as a sentence from a comment.  We then compare this vector representation of the input text to every argument that we can respond to. If the input text and our argument are very similar, we pick out the counter argument and respond to the comment. TL;DR - Machine Learning Magic âœ¨ðŸ¤–âœ¨ 

# What arguments can it respond to? 
Currently it can respond to 30 vegan argument/myths outlined by everyone's favourite internet Vegan activist [Earthling Ed](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVRrGAcUc7cblUzOhI1KfFg) (and the responses are taken from his book/[vegancheatsheet.org](https://vegancheatsheet.org/)):

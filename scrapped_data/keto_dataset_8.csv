I'm well aware a good fraction of that will be from the magical water weight/carb weight that comes from starting a diet, but still it is the largest amount of weight I've ever lost in a week. My old record was 4. 

I have read a fair few posts and articles about keto and I'm pretty sure I understand the process, though I am skipping a few steps. 

I do not know my macros, I do not weigh my food in-depth, I am very loosely counting calories and the only real number I'm tracking is carbs. 

My typical intake is between 15-30 carbs, it varies based on what meals I have. 

Are there any serious issues with not collecting statistics on my food?

I am taking a multivitamin and omega3 oil since I am not a seafood fan. 

I'm not eating like a sparrow either, my portions are large and I do not go hungry. 

I eat 2 meals a day with no snacks, an average day consists of an omlette (3 eggs, salami, cheese, salt, pepper, chives) as my first meal and a large portion of meat and brocolli for my second. Sometimes I switch the 2nd meal out for sausages and fried eggs. 

Driving water, black coffee and black tea. 

Overall, I feel great. My appetite seems to be getting worse every single day but my energy level is so high. My breath smells like fermented fruit and I am expelling so much waste. 

As far as I can see, I am achieving ketosis, I just hope I'm not dooming myself by not doing the maths. 

I know I'll give up if I need to carry the 7 and divide by 2 slices of bacon just to eat.

Over the past year and a half I’ve significantly gained weight eating junk and not being able to workout, but recently have been trying to get back to keto and working out. 

The nurse called me back and said my triglycerides were extremely high (1081), but I immediately told her I wasn’t fasted, to which she then replied “regardless it shouldn’t be near that amount”.

That morning I had sandwich meat, 6 ounces of ground beef, a slice of cheese, a carb balance tortilla, and a probably a decent amount of Mayo on the side to dip in. About 5 hours later I went to get labs done but specifically told them I wasn’t fasted and that I’d have to wait for the lipid panel(which I guess they tested).

I’d feel more at ease knowing my triglycerides are high if they were somewhere around 300-400, but I’m wondering if me eating a high fat meal hours before can influence them that much?

I thought a keto diet might end my carb cravings and bring me a peace of mind, but I tried it three times already and it never worked.

It´s the exact same thing every single time: The first two days I feel fine, but then on the third day I wake up with a racing heart beat, feeling like I have the worst panic attack of my life, or a heart attack or something. I also get violently sick and the throwing-up only stops after several hours and only after eating something like a piece of toast, because simply the thought of eating more fat makes me sick again.

I started my keto journey for the 3rd or 4th time on December 15th, so I'm coming up on 4 months of keto.  While in the past I've succumbed to cheat days that just never ended or went on vacations where it was very difficult to find food that was keto-friendly, this pandemic has actually helped me!  I haven't had a single cheat day that I would consider a cheat day.  I've generally kept to less than 20g carbs per day, only once or twice going up to 35-40.  I'm mostly OMAD but sometimes TMAD on weekends.   I don't really snack throughout the day, and whenever I feel those hunger pangs, I just drink water until I'm full and that satiates me for a while.

I started at around 325 - that's my best guess.  I don't know exactly because A) I was afraid to step on the scale, and B) my scale doesn't go above 300.  I'm currently at about 275, so around 50 pounds lost in 4 months.

While I have seemed to plateau a little bit scale-weight wise recently (seemed to be stuck around 280 for a couple weeks), that has begun dropping again.

I've found that when washing my hands, my wedding rings falls off if I'm not careful, and it's super loose regularly.  I usually take it off when cooking dinner as I wash my hands frequently and sometimes forget to put it back on.  My husband has even brought it to me asking if I was planning on leaving him since I keep leaving it places lol.  Unfortunately it's made of titanium so it can't be resized, but we only bought cheap rings at the start of our marriage with the intention of getting nicer ones in the future.  Maybe this is the impetus for that!

I recently found a fitbit and decided to charge it and wear it some more - I haven't worn it in probably 6 months, and now, it's so loose that I need to take another link out of the strap!

Most noticeable to me, was that I can actually SEE my Adam's Apple now!  I went so long not even realizing I couldn't see it, but my neck was so fat that it was hidden.  Now that I can see it again, I notice how many of my facial features have changed, and it's all the more motivation to keep going!

I started keto three weeks ago, after not being able to lose any weight with weeks of 16:8 intermittent fasting. I'm not someone who has ever been able to count calories or limit portions, so it seemed like keto was the diet for me. I read about which foods to avoid and which were allowed, and made it my goal to consumer no more than 20g of carbs per day (not net carbs, but total carbs). Because I didn't weigh portions or count calories, I can't be sure I always made the target, but here is what I did:

* Check the labels on everything that has a label, to make sure not to accidentally consume too many carbs
* Cut out sugar and anything with added sugar (occasionally using a pinch of monkfruit to sweeten my coffee or whipped cream)
* absolutely nothing carb-heavy such as bread, rice, or pasta. No legumes.
* Ate fish, seafood, and meats including beef, chicken, pork, and sausages, either sauteed or grilled and without breading
* Plenty of eggs
* Vegetables including snap peas, fennel, greens, avocado, radish, cabbage, broccoli, and asparagus. Carrots and cherry tomatoes in small amounts
* Fruits: raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries, about 1/2 to 1 cup a day
* heavy cream in my coffee and whipped on my berries
* Spirits such as gin and vodka, as well as hard seltzers (2g of carbs each)

This was a huge change to my diet. It was difficult and I was sometimes miserable. The first week I felt physically ill and didn't have a lot of appetite. The next 2 weeks I felt normal. 

No change to the amount of exercise I get, which is not a lot. Mostly walking.

For the first 2 weeks my weight didn't change. At the end of the third week I had gained 3 pounds.

I've read on here about people counting calories, fasting with keto, doing ""macros"" (don't understand that), etc. I just don't think I could stick with a diet that required too much calculating.

They're pretty generic tasting things, but when you want a cold beer on a hot day, it did the trick.   
   
I was in my friend's backyard, and he was telling me how there is hops growing on the fence line.   
We were checking it out, because plants are neat.   
He told me that if you chew on it, (not eat) it tastes like a hoppy beer.   
I did. He was right.   


He let me pick some. I took it home, chopped it up, and mixed it into a can of low carb beer.   
I did not drink it right then and there,  but rather I put it in the fridge in a sealed container.   


I waited about 3 days.

First I want to say that this transformation is nothing compared to what I’ve seen in this sub weight wise, you guys are amazing, but we all have our struggles regardless of the weight of the scale and this shit is about taking RESPONSIBILITY for yourself and your values. 

Your self esteem is the reputation that you have with yourself and it’s always watching you to see if you’re living through your values.

———

So a year ago little before my birthday I felt horrible, I worked 72h/w in a sales job. I was doing great sales wise with all time high records here and there but that shit doesn’t matter. I still destroyed my body and mind. You know just to be able to sustain the long and intensive days I had to constantly eat. I ate 6 tasty cheese every fricking day + breakfast and dinner, that’s just absurd. 

But of course... understandable considering the HUGE amount of stress the job gave me in combination with not living truthfully with myself.

———

After reflecting deeply on my values I decided to:

Quit my job and pursue what I wanted which was running why own company and getting my grades up. So I did just that. 

I decided that I wanted to have a body fat of 15% and hit 120kg bench press (which I thought was impossible at first). So I did just that.


This is actually about deciding who you want to be and sustain meaningful effort &amp; suffering. Because suffering is not bad, it’s quite good, well it’s actually a gift to be able to suffer for something meaningful and is the fundamental thing for most successes.

But if you have no direction and no meaning behind the suffering it’s a recipe for all kinds of mental disorders which will lead to other negative consequences.

https://youtu.be/u3cN_89Rpqc


Ben pakulski is someone who I've actively followed for a long time and who's muscle building programs have given me great success. He isn't someone who actively promotes a ketogenic diet but does follow the principles of it. Even before I had ever heard of the word keto, in his programs he always promoted a protein and high fat breakfast. He's never sought to be in an active state of ketosis but does promote a carb free approach to starting the day and pre training nutrition for the clarity and mental focus it provides over carb loaded meals.

Anyway, this episode is him with someone talking about following a keto diet and training for muscle building. It was good for me as a newbie to get an understanding into what actually happens on a keto diet and how you can utilise its benefits. It might not be for the seasoned ketoers because you might already have a lot of this knowledge, but for people starting out or those who just want more knowledge it's a good listen imo.

So my brother tried keto with me and my mom in January and of course he quit it even before keto flu hit him, said it was too restrictive for him. 

It's his life, his body and I promised him that I would leave him alone although we both know that he is the one in severe need to lose weight (Idk the stats, he wouldn't tell me. But if I had to guess, he might have around 350lbs being 5'5""). 
You should hear him panting after climbing 5 stairs, he has us worried.

Now, some company came up with yet another wonder drug, they even call it 'keto' and claimed that one teaspoon in the evening would get you right on the full keto train and you lose 50lbs in two weeks. No exercise, no eating restraint.

The stuff is made of a mixture of hemp oil, olive oil and some amino acid. Nothing else. 
I know this must be fraud, you just don't go keto over night by swallowing oils, especially not when keeping carbs in your diet.

The crucial thing is, he wants to buy this ridiculously expensive stuff and actually thinks it will help him without cutting out coke, fast food and all the other unhealthy stuff he puts in his mouth every day.

How can I make him see that this is just the same make-believe as any other wonder drug? Has anyone heard of this and maybe have reliable sources?
I couldn't find anything except ads for it and the TV shows where they presented it.

Person: “Hey I like those shoes”
Vegan:  “oh thank you, they’re vegan leather because the factory farming industry is destroying the planet and I just can’t contribute to that.” 

No one enjoys mealtime with vegans. They are not fun to cook for because they ask too many questions about the food you had to go online to find a vegan recipe for; and they also manage to suck to go out to eat with as well. They either have to go to specific restaurants or they have to spend 10 minutes modifying something on the menu. The prospect of eating with them is a chore and it inconveniences everyone involved. 

Vegans use weird products and further vegan they go, the weirder the products they use. Some things used by vegans are okay such as essential oil diffusers, others aren’t. I’ve seen hard core vegans use natural deodorants, smelled them too, may as well have rubbed apricot and ass under their armpits. The worst I’ve seen was a coworker of mine with yellow teeth using fluoride free natural toothpaste.

Vegans act like their minute dietary change is ‘who they are as a person now’ and base their whole persona off of it; but that trait can primarily be attributed to one of the main causes of veganism, which is the lack of enough personality traits to make them interesting as normal people. This needs to stop. I like the idea of being vegan, I like vegan food, I see nothing wrong with veganism except for the people. It’s not a loud minority, it’s the lot.

I’m not saying veganism is politically related, but I’ve just noticed that most vegans are liberal. I’ve also seen lots of conservatives completely trash on vegans.

I believe that veganism doesn’t have a political affiliation just as like how being against slavery doesn’t have a political affiliation. I’m really big on free thought, valuing facts over emotion (which conservatives constantly promote), and I view this as being 100% in line with being vegan. Ignoring animal slaughter and torture is the OPPOSITE of “facts over feelings.” If you feel so strongly about your love of meat and are willing to ignore all the facts that meat/meat products do to the world and to animals - then that is the definition of being ~too sensitive~

On the other hand I do think that liberalism ideology *today* is not very rooted in facts at all. The social change that liberals tend to promote going on now (feminism, racial movements, etc), in my opinion, has taken a dark turn don’t make a whole lot of sense when you look at the facts. I obviously support equality for all races, genders, sexual orientations, everything! But the ideological underpinning of what the movements  have become today is something I don’t necessarily agree with. And I just think they are so dissimilar from being vegan but are branded the same way!

And if you don’t care, then just say you don’t care but don’t brand vegans as being “touchy feely” when its tangible, harmful effects are supported by so much evidence.

I suppose that most of the correlation of how vegans are usually left-leaning is because liberals are known for being big on social change and conservatives are more adamant on traditional values.

I love the food. I'm moving to Seattle soon, and the few times I've visited there, I was blown away by the all-vegan restaurants. In 21 years living on Earth, I'm not exaggerating when I say the best food I've ever eaten in my life was from an all-vegan restaurant in Seattle (if you live in Seattle, you might know the place I'm talking about; it's in Greenlake 😉). But it's not just restaurants. Vanilla Oat Yeah is, like, my favorite drink. It's so delicious and I'm not surprised big dairy is scared of veganism because cow's milk was never as good as oat milk. 

I love the people. Vegans are some of the coolest people I know. Vegans are brave. You have to be brave to stand up to a cultural institution that's as huge and oppressive as carnism, to stand up to friends and family who constantly ridicule and question us. Vegans are kind. It shouldn't take a lot of empathy to realize that animals' lives are more important than humans' taste buds, but it does, and you can see it in the way vegans talk to and support each other and interact with animals and the world around them. 

Finally, I love the animals. When you think about it, not harming animals is such a simple and obvious thing, which is why we say it's the moral baseline. It *is* the  moral baseline. But I still love it. I love knowing that when I say I care about animals, it's not hollow and ironic. I love petting my cat and knowing that farmed animals have just as much individuality and personality as she does, and that I'm no longer supporting their torture and murder.

Instructions that I remember from the site:  
1. mix dry ingredients

2. mix in wet ingredients

3. knead by hand for 2 minutes

4. cut into small pieces and put in instant pot along with 1 cup of water

5. set instant pot to manual high and cook for 15 minutes

Whenever I make this, I always find that it's really chewy and rubbery. Is it an issue with the ingredients or do I just need to cook it less or something?

I forcefully drank it, as it  had already been maid, I didn't enjoy it a single bit.

I very very strongly support veganism and aspire to become an activist after my exams are over.

I live in a vegetarian home(religious reasons) they consider meat to be a bad karma, but then go on and eat milk, curd etc.

I am 17, live with my parents, will soon join college and become a full vegan.

After learning about veganism, I immediately stopped eating eggs, my brother followed(only my dad eats eggs) This was easiest move to make.

I need to study 10-12 hours a day, so I am not in any position to make my own food, I stopped drinking milk, eating curd etc.

Half of food we eat is already vegan by default But still, my family has to put butter/ghee on other half, I have to eat what has been put on plate. I don't even enjoy the taste anymore, thinking about all the exploitation.

I even tried explaining my family, who consider cow to be so called 'sacred' about the horrors of dairy industry, on one hand, they generously donate to cow shelters, on other hand keep using milk.

I can't even argue with them, it's peak time of my eams, and the'll say focus on studies not on this. I know my parents really love me and all, but this is just torture. I hope I soon join college and finally adopt veganism in a few months.

I feel jealous of you who align your actions with your beliefs.

I became vegan just 2 months ago, but I think this might help someone. 

I used to be a massive meat eater, just 2 months ago. Seriuously I couldn't rember going more than 1 day without some type of meat before going vegan (im serious). I used to proud myself in saying ""if it doesn't contain meat, its not a real meal."" Obviusly that was a joke, but there was truth to it for sure. 

The first week going vegan I felt absolutely miserable. I thought I would never enjoy food again. ALL of my favourite recepies not only included meat and dairy, but basically revolved around them. I was actually super depressed. I even made a post here lol. I remeber trying a beyond burger, and literally thinking ""yep, this doesn't taste anything like meat, I guess I am cursed to never enjoy food in my life."" Also cooking vegan bolognese fot the first time, and remeber trying it out and just throwing the whole pot away because it was gross.

Then for some reason, I swear to Zeus, after trying my second beyond burger (since the only way to get it was to buy the 10-pack) I was like ""what the hell, this isn't bad at all?"". Third time trying it, I was hooked. Its really bizzare, that it changed so quickly, but I remeber the first time the smell while it was raw (cat food, lets be honest) and grilling was foul to me. I still is, but when grilled, its godlike. Like serously, I make sure not to eat more than 1 or 2 every 2 weeks, since it isn't the healthiest food, but I would crush them and inject them in my bloodstream if I could now. Well made beyond burger with sexy lettuce, juciy tomatos, fried onions, spicy jalapeños, BBQ and chipotle sauce and baked potatos, oh lordy. Im a simple man, and thats a food orgasm to me. 

Also I tried to make a few adjustements to my vegan bolognese and it turned out extrenely delicious, literally the polar opposite of my first try.

What I wanted to say with this is don't get discouraged at the beggineng. Some things are different when it comes to recepies and it will take you some time to adjust. But I have to say, for me it changed super quickly. Way quicker than I would have thought. I haven't craved meat at all and I have never been a big cheese person anyway (I did buy vegan cheese for my bolognese and it was dope too!!). 

So if anyone is currently starting out, just because you currently feel like shit, doesn't not mean its your new ""normal"". Its NOT! Just experiment and check out youtube channels or articles.

It's very unlikely that we will be able to halt animal farming on the ethical arguments for reducing the suffering of sentient beings alone.  People want to eat meat regardless of the horrors necessary to produce it under current conditions.  

Aside from animal harm, we know that animal farming has led to zoonotic diseases that are responsible for virtually every pandemic in history, but that hasn't stopped us either.

If the biggest reason people don't care about the harms that animal farming has on people and other animals is that they just like the taste, then an actual cell-based meat would be the best alternative, right?

The problem is, this industry would have to compete with not only the meat industry, but also with plant-based industries.  I've seen the cost of lab meat go down drastically in 10 years, and really hope to see this alternative in the future, because it's probably our best shot at a healthier and more ethical future for people and other animals alike.

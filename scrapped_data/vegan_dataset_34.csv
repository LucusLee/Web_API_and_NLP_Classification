Disclaimer: I'm not vegan btw so I'll probably get downvoted to oblivion.


Would you eat something that died of age, or a non transmittable disease, or an accident not intentionally caused. Something that experienced no intentional suffering or cruelty in it's life.

Here's an example. 
You get a pet chicken and you name her cluckerina
Every day you feed her, help her, play with her, love her
You love her and she loves you
Eventually after 10 years of having a great life, cluckerina dies peacefully

Would it be ethical to eat her. She wasn't suffering in life.

Basically the idea behind meal kits is you get the ingredients for a certain number of meals (on average three) per week sent to you with a recipe card and you make them (they're marketed towards people who don't have much time to grocery shop and cook or who eat a lot of fast food). I personally keep the recipe cards in a binder so that I can make the ones I liked again. There are companies that offer vegan options and also one company (Purple Carrot) that is entirely vegan. 

The only downside is price tag - $7-10 per portion is quite a bit, so it's definitely a luxury for me and I don't order every week. 

Has anyone else tried these, or have similar ways to try out new vegan dishes that don't involve a separate trip to the grocery store and tons of leftover ingredients?

My best friend is the best vegan I have ever met. She is a vegan because that is what she morally believes is right, but she has never once tried to make me eat vegan even when I'm with her. I've had friends before that were vegans and whenever we're together they expect me to eat vegan and I do not give them a hard time about that because I understand that is their moral stance. When we're making pancakes together she makes hers vegan and she's like oh I almost forgot you're not vegan and you prefer it with eggs and she makes mine with eggs.

So I'm not kidding the most respectful vegan I have ever met. We have been friends for 5 years. That being said she has shown me some really yummy vegan food companies that have microwave meals that are delicious that I just actually like and when I'm with her sometimes I choose to eat vegan with her and she's shown me some really good recipes.

She's also British so her family has forced me to love tea and we were talking about tea and she's like well I make it this way with almond milk, but of course you'll probably be using regular milk so just use this much to make it just the way you like it at my house. And I was like oh my gosh you know what I think the tea would probably taste really good with almond milk instead of my dairy milk. I should definitely use almond milk, because it's also really good in and I listed a few other recipes that I use it in although I don't like drinking almond milk or using it in cereal.

Then suddenly I realized, and I called her on it, I'm like you are sneakily making me vegan! You are playing the long game and I respect that! You respect the fact that I'm not vegan so much that I feel the need to respect the fact that you're vegan more than I normally would and you're showing me how yummy it can be.

I first got interested when I heard bill gates say he invests in impossible burger - that isn't lab grown meat afaik but it made me think of the idea of investing in ethical shares.

I had been researching general investment lately and looking for good causes and thinking this could be a great one. Also putting you money to work I feel is better than just dumping it in a charity because with shares you can increase the return and then put it back into other companies and repeat etc.

Although I still probably wouldn't personally think it ideal - still preferring totally plant based diet, from a pragmatic standpoint I also know that for the majority of the population this is of no interest to them so investing in lab grown meat is helping to stop the killing of real animals. I think it is hopeless (in my lifetime at least) to expect the majority of the population to go plant based so might as well focus your efforts in the lesser evils.

And if it is just like real meat then it will more be a case of getting the big food chains to start using it as the customers would fall in line sooner or later with some good marketing. The food suppliers would do it probably only if it is cheaper for them and that is a long way off as this technology is way more expensive than normal meat but it is something to work towards eh? for a better future, like how Elon's cars are expensive but it is the long term vision to bring the price down.

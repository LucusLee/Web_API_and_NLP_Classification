Basically, it *feels good* to project an image of being a radical, and to receive validation from others. It reassures our moral self-understanding. It helps our social lives; it lets us connect with others in our tribe. It doesn't take much effort for a white person to share a BLM article or even attend a rally; it doesn't make much effort for a man to talk about women's rights. There's cultural support for these stances; it doesn't take real conviction to get on board.

One the other hand, here we have this gargantuan atrocity-- billions of sentient beings systematically tortured and killed. They are being gassed and castrated and electrocuted, *all so we can literally eat their bodies for pleasure.* Three day old infants literally have their nuts sliced out screaming, and their dead bodies are sold. Anyone who thinks about it honestly for even 5 minutes knows it's pure evil. It's not even ""kind of bad""; it's at the level of the worst crimes in history. But most non-vegan leftists don't care enough to go vegan, or even to do the bare ass minimum of raising awareness.

Why? Because there isn't much of a personal pay-off in being anti-speciesist. You have to change your behaviors concretely (not just say the ""right"" things); you have to accept that you've been doing something wrong your whole life; and you have to go against the majority. There are real, tangible changes required of being a proponent of animal liberation, which you don't find with other causes. There's no bullshitting possible. You have to walk the walk.

The fact that most leftists willfully ignore something so patently horrendous has made me more and more cynical. I don't think most people truly reason out *why* they believe what they do. If people had a deeper understanding of *why* racism or sexism are wrong, philosophically, they'd be much more receptive to arguments against speciesism. But most of the time, I believe many people just instinctively conform to the norm. They don't reason themselves into core beliefs, but just absorb them from others. Heidegger has this concept of ""das Man"" (the They) which basically refers to an impersonal social reality or ""background of thought."" He says that we tend to live inauthentically, and just live passively accept the values of ""the They"" because ""that is what one does.""

I don't think I'm somehow about living inauthentically (no one is), and I don't blame non-vegans who honestly are ignorant. We were all their once. But pretty much everyone at this point knows that animals are tortured and killed for food. It's willful ignorance more anything else. People choose to look away, simply because they get some minor benefit, and because they aren't made to feel like a bad person by society.",True,False,False,vegan,t5_2qhpm,579381,public,self,Disillusioned with speciesist leftists...

I first got interested when I heard bill gates say he invests in impossible burger - that isn't lab grown meat afaik but it made me think of the idea of investing in ethical shares.

I had been researching general investment lately and looking for good causes and thinking this could be a great one. Also putting you money to work I feel is better than just dumping it in a charity because with shares you can increase the return and then put it back into other companies and repeat etc.

Although I still probably wouldn't personally think it ideal - still preferring totally plant based diet, from a pragmatic standpoint I also know that for the majority of the population this is of no interest to them so investing in lab grown meat is helping to stop the killing of real animals. I think it is hopeless (in my lifetime at least) to expect the majority of the population to go plant based so might as well focus your efforts in the lesser evils.

And if it is just like real meat then it will more be a case of getting the big food chains to start using it as the customers would fall in line sooner or later with some good marketing. The food suppliers would do it probably only if it is cheaper for them and that is a long way off as this technology is way more expensive than normal meat but it is something to work towards eh? for a better future, like how Elon's cars are expensive but it is the long term vision to bring the price down.

With kitten and puppy season coming up, we desperately need help. Though we consistently operate at max capacity, the demand is still so high. On every stray feeding route, we see multiple cats and dogs that need urgent shelter or emergency medical care. Moreover, we are constantly receiving calls from pet owners asking for help re-homing their pets. We will always do our best to help each of these cases, but we are currently drowning under the demand. That’s why I am reaching out again for your help.

We feed 250+ (and counting) dogs and cats in Rabat, Morocco. With all these mouths to feed, our food supply goes quickly. We urgently need to stock up on food for both the strays and the shelter animals. Moreover, we take in predominantly sick or injured cats, and our supply of medication is running out. We are worried that they will soon not be able to receive the treatment they need.

These animals need all of our help, and we can’t do this alone much longer. Please share or donate if you can. Follow the link below to visit our website and to see all of the ways you can help us help the animals!

I struggle sometimes, because I'm replacing what would be a natural diet, and I have no real understanding of how this is affecting them.

It's often difficult to respond to this as people making these claims likely have very little knowledge of food in general.

One question to ask these people could be: 
""You can have the best chefs in the world prepare you one dish, the dish may include either only ingredients suitable for a vegan, or only ingredients a vegan would not eat (meat, milk, eggs, honey etc). What meal do you choose?

I find it difficult to believe anyone would pick the later option, especially considering salt is a vegan ingredient.

The idea here is that meat dishes are heavily dependent on plants to derive nice flavour. And I thought this question is an interesting way to get people thinking about that.

We are graduate students in the M.S. Human-Computer Interaction program at Georgia Tech working on our capstone project. We've researched and designed an internal portal to improve the relationships between CSA Farmers and their customers, more specifically helping farmers share information about CSA boxes and farm updates with their customers.



Currently, we're trying to get feedback and insights from CSA customers about the portal through a 30-minute usability study. If you're a CSA customer, we'd love to hear your thoughts on the portal and how it would fit with your CSA farm. During the study, you'll be completing a list of tasks on the portal and describing how you feel about the portal. We'll be giving you a $10 Amazon gift card for your participation.

Hi all,

I've recently watched the Game Changers Documentary on Netflix and it opened my eyes to the benefits of a plant-based diet.

However, I'm looking for evidence to see how protein from fish, eggs and cheese affects inflammation?

So far I've only found studies that include people who are heavy meat eaters.

I wonder if there's any evidence how each animal-protein affects levels of inflammation (especially fish / eggs &amp; cheese).

Does anybody have some facts &amp; figures about that? Disclaimer: I'm really looking for studies, rather than personal opinions OR ethical discussion points. Thanks for understanding and respecting the purpose of this post!

You've framed the question in a sentimental point of view, but in nature, animals (+us) are simply meant to consume other animals. (or at least carnivores/omnivores) Nature isn't sentimental about this. Ever seen a lion ripping a gazelle apart?

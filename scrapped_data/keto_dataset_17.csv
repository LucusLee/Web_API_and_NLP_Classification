I have been on keto for around 3-4 years and haven't had a blood test in around 4 years. I am 24 years old, lightly active, and have been eating a standard keto diet (meat, greens, dairy, some fruit, some keto sweetners, some nuts, etc.) up until Feb, 1st, where I tried a more keto-carnivoreish style diet (more red meat, eggs, sardines,fish, some greens, etc.) more specifically, in the past 45 days and lost around 5 more pounds (170 to 165). FYI I do not drink coffee, and I eat during a 4 hour window every day with 1 large meal around 6:00 (example: 3 1 pound grass-fed burgers with 2 eggs over easy, 2 bacon slices, and a side of olives/cucumbers or wild planet sardines) and a small meal around 8:30 (example: a little zucchini pasta with parm cheese on top) See my blood work results below. I am not concerned much for LDL, as we know that this is not inherently bad and has to do with particle size, high testosterone, etc. but as far as HDL and Trigs, I wish the ratio was better. let me know our guys' thoughts...Maybe exercising more would help with trigs? Not sure... I would also appreciate any other comments anyone has on the rest of the blood results, if any. Thanks!

So, I thought it would be interesting to start a post where everyone can discuss how they are meeting their fat requirements while also staying away from milk. As someone who is lactose intolerant, I find it hard to meet fat requirements for keto as most keto recipes call for some kind of milky product to boost the fat content. I typically stay away from alternative milks and yogurts as well, so it really puts me in a bind of not using any “milk” based product. I understand the concept of healthy fats like avocados and nuts, but you literally have to eat so much of those to get to the fat requirements in a ketosis diet that it is ridiculous. Thus, why I thought it would be neat if everyone can discuss how they go about achieving their fat requirement while also maintaining their lactose intolerance condition. It help me get ideas of how to reach my own ketosis goals but possibly help other people out as well. 

Anyway, I guess I'll start with my own suggestion. Coconut oil based fat bombs. They are versatile and can take on any flavor combo.

Hello! :) I'm currently 129lbs and looking to go down to 120 or 115. I've been keto for a month, low carb for two months. 

I've been eating exactly 25g net carbs daily (or often less) for a month now. I've restricted my calories to about 1,250 per day and have followed through the whole time; I track everything I eat with an app. I've also started drinking more water. 

I've done the strip test- my ketones are usually 4.0 to 8.0 and have been for a while. 
I also take extra ketone supplements in the morning and evening. 
Plus, to get over this plateau, I've started fasting too. I've been doing 14/10 for about 5 days now and still, the scale stays the same. 
I do light exercise- 20 mins cardio/ 30 mins weights three times a week. 

I've barely lost any weight... So far the loss total is about 1.5 lbs. 
The only significant change is that I get full a lot faster with less food, which is nice I guess. 
I was under the impression that keto made weight drop rapidly. Are there any reasons as to why this might not be happening with me? Is there anything else I can do to encourage fat burning? Anything I am forgetting?

Hi 

Little over a month ago i transitioned from a keto diet to a ”regular” diet because i wanted to enjoy myself with some candy and i didn’t feel like restricting anything anymore , it was fun at first and i was eating a bunch of chocolate and icecream almost every day , untill about a week ago. 

One day i waked up feeling very nauseus in the morning and i though it might have been food posioning from some really old garlic ive had the day before but the nausea didn’t go away. Almost every morning i wake up i feel very nauseus and unable to eat , it has been going on for weeks now 🥲.

This is very unusual for me since i use to like food and always think about tasty chocolate and stuff in the morning , but now i start getting slightly hungry around 7 - 9 hours after i wake up and when i do eat i am barley able to enjoy the food and i get filled up after a few bites and feel like i am gonna be sick😥...


What could be causing this? Diabetes/ketoacidosis? Food intolerance because i added a bunch of stuff i am not used to?

From February 2018 to August 2018 I lost 80 pounds. I didn’t do one minute of exercise during that entire period. August 2018 we went on vacation, decided we weren’t gonna NOT eat carbs on vacation, we fell off the wagon.

Nothing Major tho, didn’t really lose any weight. Once the world shuts down, I get a treadmill and i start to run every morning, still eating carbs, snacking on candy and cake at night, but I lose about 25 pounds, I quit smoking. Most importantly, I’ve developed the habit of working out and running 5-6 times a week. 

I catch Covid in January, that took me down for 2 weeks, and I gained that weight back (25 I had lost). I still run and do sets of push ups 3-5 times a week, but I believe my poor diet is why I can’t lose any weight.

I struggled to get down 1600 calories yesterday when I was hoping to get up to 2000.  Beyond that, in order to recover from the protein burnout I think I'd need at least a week away from the foods that are giving me trouble.

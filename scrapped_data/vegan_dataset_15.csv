We'll cut straight to the chase here. I recently accepted a new job (I am a bartender) at a bar which has been absolutely great, although the building is rather old. Why that's worth bringing up is because it allows the entry of at least several mice. You can probably imagine the attitude towards them harboured by the nonvegan management (who are honestly good people, just not ones who happen to be vegan).   


I am vegan myself and love animals. But, I am also aware of the sanitation issues they present in this case, which are made even more pressing in an environment such as a restaurant or bar, so I am really torn on this one. 

&amp;#x200B;

The management has set up traps around the place, which is painful enough for me to see, but my biggest point of contention is that they are using glue traps to get the poor little guys who just wanted to come in from the cold and eat some pub food (don't we all?). I am sure I don't need to tell you how horribly and gratuitously cruel those things are.   


I am just wondering, as a vegan, what is the course of action I should take that best balances practicality and compassion? I know welfarism is seen by many vegans as a tepid half measure against animal suffering, which I have nuanced feelings about, but maybe I could at least get them to use a quicker acting trap, or ideally something much much much more humane in place of that horrendous way to die. Only catch is, nobody else there is vegan, and we all know how much people traditionally sympathise with mice (or the idea of doing anything a vegan says), so I feel like this will be an uphill climb. Furthermore, I am, as I said, very new at my job, and I must admit I would ideally like to evade being labelled as 'that guy' who gets a new job and then feels entitled to tell the management how to run their business. 

&amp;#x200B;

For most of that time I have been dealing with fatigue issues and a lack of recovery from workouts. These issues have only gotten worse over time to the point of me not being able to workout because even a simple workout will take days to recover from. I never considered my diet as a potential cause because I was at my strongest while vegan and I have done countless blood tests that have all come up fine. The fatigue also didn't become debilitating until after a year or two vegan, but I am starting to question my diet because after years of seeing doctors I have gotten nowhere.

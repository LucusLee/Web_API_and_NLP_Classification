https://preview.redd.it/96csy5nk1fq61.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0aa778ea8ba7325774f50459cd935320f98df0a6

So what's that ? A pizza. One that is vegan and cheese free.  
So what ? So begin the story of an individual who knocked down everything he knew about how the things are supposed to be.

&amp;#x200B;

Veganism changed my take on pizza. When I made my first vegan pizza years ago, **I was sooooo attached to put cheese replacement**. That's how it is supposed to be, that's how tradition works, that's how it will be. Oh god... I had hard time to swallow those industrial vegan cheese. My tummy was not happy. Years later, I now make pizza without cheese. Some people around me feel like it's not ""real"" pizza, because we don't have the pleasure of that melted cheese string growing as you try to tear it the higher you raise it. And I get it. It was 30 years of habits that I had to put aside. I loved every single cheese string. But pizza (sorry dear italian) can be and will from now on (for me at least) be enjoyed without cheese or any kind of replacement. It *just* requires to deconstruct what society told you pizza should be. As the song says : ""**make your own kind of pizza, topped it with your own special parts""** or something like this. I don't know 😊

&gt;For those who don't have the song reference, here it is : [https://youtu.be/iQ7dTMPwUi8](https://youtu.be/iQ7dTMPwUi8)

I know. I know. ""Dude, it's just a freaking pizza..."". I guess you are right. But this pizza right here is the results of years of years of social deconstruct. Not just veganism, oh no. I wish it was that simple. It catapulted me in a world I never though to discover. A world where I had to deconstruct my whole social world.

It's a muscle. Every time I watched a documentary on veganism, that muscle activated. Doubt everything, question everything. Is this how things are supposed to be ? Why male character have more dialogue time in Disney than female one ? Are electric cars really that green ? Are we supposed to be all boy / girl ? Why should asian should be good at math and ""rice eater"" when I eat more rice than 80% of the one I know ? Should I eat this boeuf bourguignon at Christmas because we've been doing it since I was born ? Why is it that I should have a kid by now ?

It may be be far-fetched. I mean, the guy is writing about LGBTQIA+, about food, about relation between men and women (and all those in-between, my bad I'm not familiar enough yet). Well it all boiled down to that one simple thing : social deconstruct.

30 years of having meat every meals. 30 years of drinking milk because ""they are our friends"" (french ads). 30 years of considering meat manly and vegetables an option. And so much more.

I am thankful for veganism. Not because I live an (almost) cruelty free lifestyle, but because I had to deconstruct the world around me and ended up more humble about my life as a white guy in a developped country, and compassionate for those who must endure.

For a great number of people, being vegan is about the animals and the cruelty. I'm not completely there yet but someday I will. God I hate those ingredients list that ends with 0.01% of powedered milk. For now, it is about deconstructing everything I know about the world I was raised in.

And that, dear readers, is a pizza which has been socialy deconstructed and rebuilt from scratch. Well almost, I still make them round most of the time, with tomato sauce and all but you got the idea. The best I have every week for several months now. One day I'll be fully vegan, one deconstruction at a time.

Not sure about the goal of this post, probably some make my ego blush a tinny little bit but I also hope it could serve some people to tackle way more than veganism in their path.

If you compare it to gluten-free foods, most foods that don’t contain gluten say it right on the packaging, which is great and very helpful to people with gluten allergies. I wish it was more industry-standard to also have a vegan label.

I was reading about it, and there doesn’t appear to be as many industry standards around labeling something as vegan, but there are definitely products out there that do, usually those that are “intentionally” vegan or marketed to vegans/vegetarians. Just makes me wonder why brands don’t advertise their vegan products as such, or if they anticipate that it might actually hurt sales (I.e. a non-vegan person being wary of or less likely to purchase a vegan product).

A) all drugs you buy come from probably come from some kind of gang, that will engage in violence with their competitors which causes a great deal of suffering,

B) plantations that grow cocaine,heroin and other drugs use slave labour which is obviously not vegan,

C) I’m personally ok with people taking whatever shit and shite they like as long as they know what’s in it, it’s what it gets cut with that I have an issue with. Given that the process of cutting causes the drugs to become way more dangerous and cause suffering, is it vegan?

My answer was, if it was all legalised and regulated over the table then none of this would be an issue, but that feels like the “I’ll wait for lab meat” answer.

Furthermore, by going Vegan we save billions (yes, you read it right, billions...) of animals from being raped, slaughtered, tortured, abused and killed. There's absolutetly no reason that can justify all of this. It's wrong. It's stupid. It's dangerous. It's evil. It must be stopped.

I will bring my own snacks for others to try at gatherings, but I don't comment on what other people eat (except with close friends and family). I think this is, in general, a healthy approach.

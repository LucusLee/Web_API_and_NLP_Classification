Something I hadn't realised though is that the documentary has almost nothing to say about dairy and eggs. At all. 

The only small mention about dairy is that the dairy cows are kept chained up all day long in factory farms. Nothing about the constant raping, the separation of baby and mother, the resulting bellowing from the mothers and the killing of the calves. 

The only thing about hens that is mentioned is that they live their lives in battery cages, nothing about the chick culling! This is one of the most important things about why egg production is horrific

I'm new to this subreddit, I read the rules but I'm sorry if it's a bit vague.. hope not?? :( Unintentional, sorry! 

Hi! I'm a 14-year-old girl, and I've been vegetarian pretty much all my life. I was basically forced into it by my parents (Indian brahmins, while some brahmins from other parts of India do eat meat, the brahmins from where I'm from almost rarely do... I'm one of them) because of a) yes, the religion we are a part of (Hinduism) and b) my mom genuinely loves animals and cares for them greatly, doesn't want us consuming any meat for that reason. In fact, it's probably more because of that than anything else but also definitely religious reasons. But not here to talk about religion and my random reasons. for being vegetarian, sorry! But we are vegetarian, not vegan. Thought I should just give a bit of backstory

I've kind of wanted to be vegan for a while though! I feel like I will be healthier (I had a dairy allergy, not lactose intolerance but a dairy allergy that I seemed to have grown out of (?) just when I was maybe 12 years old. So I kind of already couldn't consume dairy or I'd break out in hives and shit) But yeah, I feel like I'd be healthier in that sense. I do consume egg, might be a bit hard to break out of but I think I can get through it! But as my mom's reasons for being vegetarian, I also just care a lot for animals and don't want to engage or assist in the bad practices in any way. 

I just had a few questions if there's anyone here who is vegetarian and wanting to be vegan and then became vegan! I'll phrase this better xD : vegetarian to vegan folks here? 

1) If you guys were around my age (teenagers) when you made the change, does it have any effects on your body and stuff? As in I am still growing, haven't hit puberty yet (I have a few medical conditions that are fairly serious, that might be why) but I don't think that it would have any negative effects as opposed to what already is there? As in let me explain this better: I eat eggs with hormones and shit and whatever they put in them already, if you guys have been in the same situation with going vegan did this negatively affect your body in any way? I'm not too concerned as it's just veganism but just to be sure. 

2) Also for teens my age when you made the switch, did you guys cook your own meals? Or have someone cook it for you somewhere else? I guess aside from egg/cheese/milk, as I'm vegetarian I basically just eat rice and veggies all day every day anyways, I suppose that would be vegan? But just wondering if you guys made any new foods on your own or your parents or whatever made them for you still. 

3) One more question, do you guys take any supplements for any nutrients you might be missing? I'm not asking about how to get B-12 in your diet or anything like that (I've already been taking B-12 supplements for a year or so as it is) just wondering if you guys take any supplements. As in, any gummy vitamins or anything like that, maybe calcium or whatever if you guys already do that? 

&amp;#x200B;

:( I'm sorry if I broke any of the FAQ questions or anything, don't think I did! Thank you guys! I just want to try to get into veganism because I do feel like since I rarely eat dairy anyway as it still fucks me over a tiny bit, and I do care about the well being then veganism would be a good solution since I'm kind of ""halfway"" there with being vegeatarian.

I developed an eating disorder around 5 years ago. Although I’ve wanted to go completely vegan, in order to recover from my ED I had to stop analyzing everything I did and ate. Now I’m doing really great. I’m back to a healthy weight, I work out to gain muscle/stay healthy (rather than lose weight), and I’m starting to cook/bake more! I have the time and resources to finally go vegan but I have to be extremely cautious and take it slow. Oh, and last thing you should know- I am TERRIBLE at cooking. Absolutely awful. So I’ll definitely need advice on how to keep things as simple as possible. 

Okay, so on to my questions. (You don’t have to answer all of them or u can just give me random advice) 

•What are some must have vegan ingredients?
•How do you avoid disordered eating? (If you’ve had an ED before)
•What are some good vegan food brands?
•Do you take vitamins or supplements? If so, what?
•What are some tips you have to keep things simple?
•How do you deal with dietary constraints while eating out or traveling?
•Whats your favorite part about being vegan?
•How did you start eating vegan?
•And just any good old advice you have for me

I rediscovered and matched with a friend from elementary/high school on Tinder a couple of months ago. Idk if they like me back or not but I’m stupid in love with them and I live to please people. We’ve gone to the park, played with our dogs together, they invited me to a party (where they got drunk and called me hot a bunch lmao 😳), etc. I had asked them to be my valentine and they said yeah but platonically which is cool but confusing because they swiped on me and also called me hot. So basically, I’m getting mixed signals. 

I’m a vegan, and they’re pescatarian, and I still love them lol, and I made them a whole vegan lasagna because they were really busy one week with a new job. Then I made them vegan cookies just because. This week they cancelled some plans we wanted to make to hang out, which makes me even more confused but they said they were having mental health problems so I understand. No worries. I told them I’d make them a care package. I want to make them some food and some dessert for their care package. 

Now here’s the problem: I try looking up “what food to make for someone feeling depressed” or whatever, but I only get “TOP TEN EASY SIMPLE OK ENOUGH MEALS TO COOK FOR YOURSELF WITH MINIMAL EFFORT WHEN YA GOT BIG SAD”. And when I try to think of comfort food ideas I only get very non-vegan stuff coming to mind, or something ridiculously romantic that I’m way too shy to present (a cake? Like are we getting married or something? lmao) or something I know would be subpar to a non-vegan (yes yes silken tofu but does vegan cheesecake actually compare?). 
 
I’m depressed too, but for this person I would wake up early and invent a vegan crème brûlée. I would sculpt them an oat milk ice cream statue or even learn what ‘leavening agent’ means. I would buy name-brand Beyond beef where I wouldn’t even buy Daiya cheese for myself, and if they just wanted to be friends I would still do it a hundred times again with no regret.

So there's this company called Perfect Day Foods that literally have developed vegan whey. 

Warning: I am not a biochemis!
So they took the DNA of whey protein from an open source database, fed (?) it to a type of bacteria, the bacteria uses that as its blueprint for what it's going to be when it grows up, they ferment it, and the end product is chemically identical to whey protein from a cow!! Longer description on their website here: https://perfectdayfoods.com/process/

They literally still even need to write ""contains dairy"" on the package, even though it is vegan!

So they're selling this product to food manufacturers and it looks like there are three ice cream brands on the market that use the ingredient. Soon it looks like there will be yogurt and cheese, which I am so pumped for!

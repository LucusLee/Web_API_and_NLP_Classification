100% of all the negative comments I've seen so far are people grasping at straws and detracting from the main message.

&amp;#x200B;

*'Some facts are inaccurate'* 

But the majority that are accurate are still painting a pretty horrific picture! 

&amp;#x200B;

*'Rural communities need fish to survive'*

Um yeah of course, they aren't the issue! You sitting at home eating fish three times a week are! As the director said  “The people that rely on those fish, the best thing we can do to ensure that they can survive – and that there’s enough fish for them to eat is – for us people who have the privilege to avoid eating it.” 

&amp;#x200B;

*'This documentary reeks of white saviour and of blaming minorities'*

The director is Iranian, and by far the worst images are from a bunch of white people using modern technology for their 'traditional' whale genocide day. I think its just blaming humans to be honest.

&amp;#x200B;

*'Sustainable fishing is the only way to save the ocean'*

What are you even on about. That's like trying to save someone's life by stabbing them with a knife made out of 100% recycled material.  

&amp;#x200B;

*'Vegan alternatives are just as bad, they do just as much damage and take up just as much land'*

First off, no they don't. You only have to look at the percentage of land used to feed animals to see where most of the land usage is going. Secondly, demand leads to innovation. With our population boom, we won't be able to sustain any diet, let alone one that requires the mass production of live animals to feed us. I definitely think a large percentage of our future food is going to be produced artificially, including meat and fish.

&amp;#x200B;

Alright, rant over, I know I'm just preaching to the choir here but just had to get that off my chest.

If this discussion is too off topic for r/vegan, I'll take it down.

I think we all agree the reason that eating animals is wrong is because animals have the capacity to suffer. This means it's equally wrong to kill and eat a chip vs a fish, as intelligence is not directly linked to ability to suffer . What if, however , biologists developed a version of an animal that has guaranteed no ability to suffer? Either the part of their brain that registers pain and fear is turned off, or they actually enjoy being killed and eaten (like that one cow in HitchHikers guide to the galaxy's restaurant at the end of the universe). Would it be ethical to Breed this creature into existence in the first place? If we think meat eating on a human-wide scale will never cease, is it actually MORE moral to breed this animal into existence?

&amp;#x200B;

I remember a couple of years ago raw diets used to be the rage. Digestive issues of any kind? just go fruitarian. But their popularity seems to have died down and a lot of the YouTube guys that preached it have reverted back to more traditional diets.

&amp;#x200B;

But I'm still curious on why it would work the way it does. Aren't these people ravenously hungry? I see a lot of endurance type athletes out of the niche that swear by the diets. I've heard it said that certain negatives (such as low protein) are actually a positive and that they had no problem building strength while eating only fruit.

There's a lot of talk about how they make you feel so spiritual and I'm also curious if this has anything to do with the diet

the oil in it is sunflower seed oil, which is extremely high in omega 6, which can be a huge problem for dogs on a vegan diet, it causes a lot of inflammation and it severely limits their conversion of ala to dha and epa (omega 3)


and this is why after switching my dogs to vdog nuggets they have become really itchy and keep biting their bodies.

Since vegan dogs are not recieving dha and epa (which either comes from fish or algae), and they're recieving ala Instead, then they would have enough omega 3 to combat the inflammation from high Omega 6 intake, which makes high omega 6 intake a much bigger problem for vegan dogs than non vegan dogs.

You can give dogs algae oil, but it's not necessary, it's better to switch them to a good vegan dog food that doesn't use a high omega 6 oil, then they won't have high omega 6 levels and they would also be able to convert ala to dha and epa.

Sadly, i have a 15kg unopened bag of vdog nuggets that they have to go through, so i may order them algae oil while they go through it so that it helps with their skin problems from the high omega 6 content in their dog food

Not even to be a preachy vegan about it, this is just straight up incorrect usage of the word. People opt for euthanasia when they have painful terminal illnesses, I get my cat euthanised when she's old and suffering.

It's not possible to euthanise a healthy young bull, chick, or even an older layer hen (who is at least as healthy as she was when she was pushing out an egg a day), because by definition euthanasia is killing to end suffering.

I have been vegan for 3 or so years now and I never thought I'd have a problem with my partner eating meat but I'm finding myself feeling conflicted about this situation. 

Let me tell you about my partner. He is a young adult from East Malaysia and we have known one another for 3 years in a long distance relationship. One time early on in the relationship he sent me a very long list of reasons why veganism is not good, most of them were health reasons. He now has come to respect my diet and even supports my vegan page. He even sends me recipes now. I've never once said anything about his diet and simply stated that I'm fine with him just as long as he doesn't expect me to cook for him.

The problem I have with him is the insane variety of meats he eats. He consumes everything from pangolin, frogs, insects, jellyfish, crocodile, water monitors, frogs, pig insides... The list is endless, and of course he eats the standard pork, beef chicken and fish. He also slaughters animals when it comes to traditional native festivities. This as you might imagine is very hard for a vegan to tolerate, and I feel I am coming to a point where I might burst if he tries to describe to me what a squirrel tastes like again. 

I know it's not his fault I feel this way because I've never confronted him. And when I've shown discomfort he gently says he'll never let me see the slaughters and that I must understand it is just ""traditional"". And that this is how Malaysia is. It's the norm. I don't believe that it's difficult to go against the norm nor find vegan or vegetarian dishes there, having gone myself.

I want to know if anyone else has been in a similar situation and how I can change his ways of eating but I don't know how to begin. When I ask my parents they just say I must respect that or leave him. I love him incredibly and want to show him how amazing veganism or even just reducing meat intake can be.

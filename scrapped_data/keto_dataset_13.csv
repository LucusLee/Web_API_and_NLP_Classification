I decided to do something differently with my tracking this around. I was using Fitness Tracker, which was fine, but the problem I had was that I would eat something that “seemed” keto and then track it, sometimes not until the end of the day or even the following morning. Even when I thought I was in good shape for the day, I often found myself in the 30-40 gm territory from sneaky carb content. 

Meal planning would help address this; but I am someone who really has a hard time eating things I’m not on the mood for. And I tend to graze out of the fridge for most of my meals; I only really cook proper meals on the weekend. Otherwise it’s just throwing together a plate of meat, cheese, and whatever else looks good. 

My solution is to compile a spreadsheet of the keto foods I like best and eat most. I captured their net carbs per my typical serving. I categorized them by general type and in order of what I should be eating (protein, veg, seed/nut, fat, condiment, fruit). Then I sorted the contents with in each category from most to least net carbs per my typical serving. 

Because it’s on my computer screen, it’s easy to track throughout the day, and then I can easily see what my balance of net carbs is and then look at my options by scanning the top and middle of each category when I’m running low on carbs. By keeping protein at the top, I’m channeling my snacking on that direction since I can scan the list until something looks good, starting with proteins (versus scanning my fridge and starting with cheese or hot dogs).

A ketogenic lifestyle consists of eating the ketogenic way: low carb, high healthy fat, and moderate protein 99 percent of the time - even if it’s your birthday. What does it mean to eat ketogenic, though? Well, basically you eat in such a way that your body produces ketones. Don’t worry, this is not scary; in fact, ketones can protect your brain from Alzheimer’s and other problems, such as brain fog and memory. What if you started eating the way your ancestors used to eat? What would that look like? When you consider what your ancestors did not have, namely processed food, you can see what that might look like. The food around was that which was easily available such as berries, wild animals, and vegetables that are easy to grow like spinach, cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower. Because it was hard to catch food, they also had to ensure everything they ate was as high in fat as possible so that they could keep on enough weight to be healthy. But not fake fat, of course - healthy fat from fruit like coconut oil and olive oil. Some people also enjoy ghee, which is clarified butter, in this plan. That’s the other thing that is awesome about the ketogenic lifestyle; you do have lots of leeway in what you eat if it follows the main goals, which are to eat low carb, high fat, and moderate protein most of the time. Processed food is full of refined sugars, unhealthy fats, and chemicals that no one can pronounce and will leave you unsatisfied, always craving more. And guess what; it’s not your fault if you’re always craving more. They made the food that way. The food you’re eating is designed to cause cravings. Processed food is made to hook you on it, just like opiates. The food scientists know the exact combinations of fat, salt, and sugar to hook you. They’ve found the formula to make every meal into a drug. What’s worse is that this drug will make you fat, unhealthy, prone to diabetes and you’ll likely die earlier than you otherwise would. Even when you think you’re eating small amounts of food called ""diet"" food, you can be fat and very unhealthy. In fact, thin people whoare eating a fully processed diet are also very unhealthy and prone to illness. Disease manifests differently in everyone. Thankfully, the ketogenic diet has become more mainstream. People are taking to it and getting healthier. They’re getting healthier because it’s simple. They don’t have to think too hard to know whether they can have that food or not. Due to this fact, it makes it easy for the ketogenic way of eating to become a full-on lifestyle. That’s good, because one thing that can ensure that people really change for life, and make eating keto a habit, is to turn it into a lifestyle. When you know you’re going to live this way forever, that you’re not taking breaks, and that you’re not doing it for just the next few weeks until the big party, then you tend to stick to a healthier way of eating because it’s just normal and natural.

Been on keto two weeks, still overeating on keto. Got metallic taste in mouth and realizing that’s a sign I’m in ketosis. Wondering if my appetite will decrease with time considering I am doing keto correctly this time.

Hey! From my other posts, I described my struggle with binge eating.. The reason why I am posting it here is because I noticed my binge eating got worse when I started “keto” months ago, and I am assuming because I kept going on and off+added many sweeteners to my diet which I cut all out. Anyways I am now doing stricter keto and am trusting the process. I want to say that these cravings are carb cravings, because I will eat and wait it out and still want to eat. But I am not certain, it could just be psychological.

I am two weeks in. I started the first week eating 3500-5500 keto. I know it’s crazy, I don’t know how or why I have such a big appetite. It’s NOT hunger, they are cravings. My appetite has reduced a little, I have few days I eat under 1500, but it fluctuates from 2000-3500 if I’m being honest. I am drinking water, but it’s seriously getting insane. I am 170ish 5’8bfemale. 

Anyways, you know that feeling when you are hungry, but you genuinely don’t mind eating? Like you feel satisfied with very little food. I’m trying to get that. I know some people will say “maybe keto is not for you” but then again, carbs will make me go even crazier, ESPECIALLY sugar, lol. So there is no point in me not doing this, especially since I am counting carbs far more strictly. Plus carbs make me tired. At least I can over eat and not want to fall asleep after a meal hahaha. I do exersice enough to maintain my muscle but that’s about it

So what I wanted to ask, was should I just trust the process? These cravings are insane and I’m trying to find out if they are carb cravings or if I just need to find some help with my history of binging / starving. I used to be able to lose weight easily, but that is not the case anymore, and I’m not sure why. Because I don’t simply lose all control around food, I eat and I wait it out , and when I realize I still have cravings, that’s what adds up the calories and causes me to overeat. It’s not like I come home and just eat everything in sight. 

But I wanted to share, today for the first time, I tasted that “metallic” taste and my pee smells weird, even water tasted weird. This didn’t stop me from overeating a lot, but it was a sign that I am in ketosis. 

So what do you guys think? Do you think that if I wait it out these cravings will go away? Idk if 2 weeks is long enough for not.I think I kind of got excited to realize that taste in my mouth. I thought “hey, maybe this keto thing is just in the process and your insane appetite will eventually adapt” and I am eating less than the first few days, but still a lot. I can’t control these cravings lol I just need to eat.

Around 6 years ago when I was probably around 17, I lost 40 pounds after discovering keto and it's always held a special place in my heart.  


So I've been hardcore dieting for the last 5 months and because of the strict level of the calories I'm at, I basically have no choice but to do Keto to hit my dietary fat needs and protein goals. My first question is regarding how long I've been holding onto what feels like basically a waterbed like consistency of fat around my mid section/love handles. I'm 23, 6'4 at 180\~lbs so I'm nearing the end here of my cut, but at the same time I just can't seem to drop this portion. I feel like I've had it for the last 2 months at least, but my upper abs have became more visible as well different portions of my body such as much more quad definition/minor striations. So I doubt it's the pre-whoosh effect/squishy fat. It feels nothing like the rest of the fat on my body which is why it's odd to me. In fact, it's EXTREMELY pliable. Almost reminds me of PlayDough or that magic-mud cornstarch mixture that got pretty popular for awhile. Very lost at why my body may be holding it like this.  


On a pretty unrelated note (I think? :\^D) do you guys have any idea about how much maltodextrin is actually in one of [these Kool-Aid packets?](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0055/0984/0947/products/KOOL-AID-UNSWEET-STRAWBERRY-KIWI-Packets-0.17oz-043000955277_16330-_B_grande.jpg?v=1576856176) I drink between a gallon or two a day of kool-aid (so 2-4 packets) mixed with my magnesium and pure, raw sucralose powder.

My husband and I have been off and on Keto for the better part of the last two years. Every time that we've been going strong something happens and we end up going off. The first time was financial reasons, and the past year I've lost my grandmother and my uncle.  It seems like every time something emotional hits it triggers my anxiety and depression disorders and I end up getting some kind of fast food that's unhealthy. We quit this time because I was having near constant panic attacks about family drama and buying our first home. The stress that came along with moving and having t handle family made my husband suggest we use food for comfort while getting through this time. It did help with the panic attacks but now I'm feeling depressed, lethargic and I just need some support. 

The worst part is that I'm fairly certain I'm allergic to nightshades, (Things like Potatoes, Tomatoes, Bell Peppers) because I cut them out completely when on Keto, and whenever we go off Keto I get back my acid reflux, and migraines as well as acne flare-ups. 

I know that it's a mindset issue. Keto helps with my anxiety and depression disorders once I've been into ketosis for about two weeks and I'm feeling rather worthless and awful about myself. If I were good enough, we would have just stayed keto and I'd be on my weight loss journey. Instead, I'm the heaviest I've ever been, my stomach hurts all the time and I'm struggling with my daily life. My parents and siblings have never been supportive emotionally and it's hard to feel alone a lot. My husband is very supportive but whenever he's at work these lonely feelings just creep in. 

I'm not asking for any help in regards to my mindset, I really need to hear some supportive words from a community that understands my daily struggles with self-image and weight loss. We're planning on restarting Keto in a few weeks once we move into our home. 

Thanks for letting me vent a little, even just typing this has helped.

I was tested for insulin resistance because it's quite common with PCOS, but I did not have it.

I even bought an glucose meter and compared to the labs at the exact time and they come out almost identical.   My  glucose goes from 88 to 96 all day long and two hours after eating (keto) it only moves up to 100

I went on it strictly for weight loss, but along the way, I found myself really enjoying the ""side effects."" I felt more energized, more alert, had a decrease in appetite, and felt more empowered/determined. 

&amp;#x200B;

I stopped doing keto due to a surgery I had to get and my doctor recommended that I return to a ""regular"" diet while I recover. Truly, I miss doing keto. For most people, it can be a challenging regime to follow; there's definitely a lot of willpower, determination, and self control that goes into it, but it definitely made me proud of myself that I was following through. 

&amp;#x200B;

Many people know that keto is under a lot of scrutiny by the media a majority of the time. I saw this with my friends as well. When I started getting into keto and had to be more conscious of what I ate, I felt judged and unsupported. The common things they would say is what a lot of people hear: ""This doesn't seem sustainable at all."" ""You're not going to die if you have carbs."" ""This isn't healthy at all."" ""You're just going to end up gaining all the weight back once you finish anyway."" I would explain the positive changes I was seeing, but it would go in one ear and out the other. Sometimes, a part of me felt like it came from jealousy. My roommates, on the other hand, had no problem with my keto diet, and frankly didn't even care that I was on it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know people will say that they're not my real friends if they don't support me, but I don't like to fall under this line of thinking. They're great friends but I feel that people are more ""supportive"" of keto after they've done it. My parents were both keto for a year and my aunt has been keto for 4 years and they were super supportive of me. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is... What have been your experiences with judgment towards your regime, and how did you ignore/overcome it? What kept you motivated throughout, etc?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm about three weeks into keto and I'm just really grateful for not only the diet itself, but also the great information I've gleaned by lurking around this sub. 

&amp;#x200B;

Utilizing essentially a form of ""dirty"" keto and 16:8 IF, I've been able to break down my (almost nightly) acid reflux to 0 (one occurrence in the last three weeks), tone down my junk food cravings, and get to a point where I almost forget to eat during the day! And while I don't personally look all that much different, the scale informs me that I've dropped 16# since starting. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few observations:   
\-I don't know if it's the keto or the IF (or both) but they do something magical to my cravings. Very little (if any) junk/carb cravings 

\-I haven't broken my occasional need for an energy drink in the morning, but it's definitely lessened. And when I need one, I reach for a Red Bull Zero or a Rockstar Total Zero. 

\-Fallen in love with chicken thighs! Batch-cook them in the Instant Pot, shred them, and store them in the fridge for a cheese wrap, salad, or just heated in a bowl with Franks Red Hot! 

\-There's still an occasional sweet tooth calling me, and I've discovered the absolute best alternative: Atkins Peanut Butter cups. 3g net carbs and they're as delicious as Reeses! 

\-Cheese. Cheese, cheese, cheese.

I did keto \~3,5 years ago and went very well for me.  
In the last 2 years i've been eating a lot of junk food and got around \~118kg (195cm height - 22 yrs old) and now i want to go back to keto to regulate my weight and fix my lifestyle.

I did a blood test today to have a reference point before starting but the results are pushing me back a bit. I was reading  about cholesterol stuff but i didn't really found a clear answer for my situation.

So, my lipidic profile is the following:

**Lipids** 681 mg/dL  - optimal level between 400 - 700   
**VLDL** 35 mg/dL  - optimal level &lt; 30   
**TG** 176  mg/dL - optimal level &lt; 150, borderline 150-199, high &gt; 200  
**LDL** 124,7  mg/dL - optimal level &lt; 100, near normal limit 100-129, borderline 130-150, high &gt; 160  
**HDL-C** 36.2 mg/dL - low &lt; 40,ideal &gt;= 60  
**CHOL** 184.5 mg/dL - optimal &lt;200, borderline : 200-240, high &gt; 240  

This leads to a TG:HDL ratio of **almost 5** which is close to very bad from what i know. How close is this linked to junk food and how fast can you decrease it?  
Should I lower TG/increase HDL before starting keto? is this high because i'm kinda fat right now (**31 BMI**) and it will level down with time?  
Should i start keto at all at this point?

I had a very successful first 'attempt' at a Keto diet last Summer which I thoroughly enjoyed - losing almost 9.5 KG and 3.5% body fat in 3/4 months. Whilst the diet was sustainable, I felt great, healthy, energetic etc. I did quit for 3-4 months and following the birth of my daughter and an over-indulgent Christmas break I had put pretty much all of it back on, which I thought was fair enough.

I've tried again this year, with some success - 6.5KG and 3.2% body fat loss in the same period, but finding it harder work and less rewarding this time around - I think as the gains are slower than the previous period?

I'm copying below the 'data points' from both periods and I'd really greatly appreciate your feedback to help me get answers to my two main questions:

1. I've used so many different calculators it's difficult to know what kind of weight and body fat % loss I should be targeting (per week) and if my Macros are (or were) optimised. I got the feeling with attempt #1 I was potentially losing weight a little 'too quickly', but that also gave me the flexibility to have cheat days knowing it would not derail me for too long.
2. Should I be taking the logical approach and reverting to my previous Macros where I was getting results I was happy with? I am currently 85KG which is by no means heavy, but my body-fat is around 25% fat which I am desperate to reduce. I do very little exercise currently, due to a combination of COVID and new family life - if that makes any difference.

**Attempt #1 (Averages)**

FAT - 120G / 65%  
PROTEIN - 105G / 25%  
CARBS - 17G / 4%  
CAL - 1600

I was around 193 then. I’ve started Keto twice before but gave up, both times I dropped 10 pounds in the first week. This time I was keeping up with my water WAY better however. This time I only dropped 4.4 pounds in the first week. Yesterday I woke up to discover I weighed a pound more than I did the morning before. I still weigh exactly that this morning. 185.8. So in these weeks I’ve essentially only dropped 2 pounds at most, since I will regain at least 5 pounds of water weight as soon as I go back to eating carbs. This diet is not going to be a lifetime change for me. I was just trying to drop some quick pounds before trying for another baby with the hubby.

I’ve been logging my daily food intake and have stayed well within my carb goals of less than 18g a day. Often I’m ending the day with 8 or more carbs remaining. I’ve also not gone over my other macros either. And have stayed within range of all of them. I’m definitely not eating too much and I don’t snack much as I hate virtually all sugar alternative snacks. My ketones tests all come back positive everyday.

Is this normal weight loss? Or should I just give up? Maybe Keto just cannot work for me. This is a very hard diet to stick to. I’ve no problems giving up snacks, as I’d already limited myself before I started keto, but no pasta or rice or bread is very hard. Still I could easily stick with it if it were actually doing any good but at this point I feel it’s not doing much of anything at all. Two pounds (maybe) in the first week is not worth it. I could eat healthier and force myself to actually excessive for that measly amount. Any thoughts, advice, especially from those keto veterans out there, would be great!

I saw someone said something about mislabeled or moldy product on this sub, but that's pretty obscure. Anyone have any real insight?

I'm actually not even doing keto anymore but I'm still gravitating towards low carb/high protein/fat because eating straight carbs/bread just makes me hungry right away. I used this stuff to make french toast with really good macros daily and my breakfasts just haven't been the same since :( I honestly can't even enjoy regular french toast because I'm starving within a couple hours if I make it with normal bread.",True,False,False,keto,t5_2rske,2350055,public,self,"Aldi keto bread still out of stock, is it discontinued?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/mgg02g/aldi_keto_bread_still_out_of_stock_is_it/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,

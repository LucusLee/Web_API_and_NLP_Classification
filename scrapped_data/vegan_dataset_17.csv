I came to the US from Bangladesh as an international student. I am currently in my senior year and would be graduating in about a month. My university is in small town in the South where, being a predominantly conservative state, my only viable options to shop for grocery are Walmart and Kroger. There are no vegan restaurants around me either. I live with 3 roommates who are all meat eaters, and we often buy common food items together (like buying a 20 lbs bag of rice and sharing it between us). Also, although this may go without saying, I'm hella broke. 

Now, I have recently watched a couple documentaries on the ethical, health and environmental aspect of animal agriculture, and I am completely convinced that I want to go vegan. I am not overly health conscious. However, I think I would like to make nutritional completeness a goal in my transition to veganism. The purpose of this post is to get some help from any of you, if possible, with some roadblocks: 

1. I have a taste preference for my traditional foods. Think Indian veg food with the addition of small portions of fish (which is mostly added for flavor as well as protein) and other non-veg Indian items like chicken Tikka masala and such. I'm considering replacing the fish in the traditional vegetable dishes with some other kind of protein that's relatively cheap (maybe adds some flavor too?). What would be some of my options? 
2. I watched some videos suggesting that I buy legumes, nuts, beans and whole grain from whole food stores where I can get the exact amount I need. Having no whole food stores near me, what would be my option to include these ingredients in my food? 
3. What are some good vegan snacks that would be comparable to hot Cheetos, or Lay's kettle-cooked jalapeno chips? Are there any popular brand name chips that are vegan? 
4. Please also include any tips, if you have any, to save money on grocery trips.

Hi Everyone,

We are working on creating an Instagram support pod using Telegram with a focus on vegan lifestyle, sustainable &amp; cruelty – free fashion. If you have are working to grow on Instagram, this could be a great pod to join &amp; grow your reach and engagement.

If you are unfamiliar with Telegram pods, they are communities formed to increase your reach and visibility on Instagram. You will need to download Telegram app to join. While there are many other engagement pods out there, we were not able to find one with a vegan / sustainable fashion niche so we created one.

If you are interested in joining, please comment on this post &amp; I will send you the link!

For me, I haven't gotten the virus but I did get my gallbladder taken out; and since then, it's been hard to eat anything unhealthy; everytime I eat cheese, milk, more than a dash of oil or butter, etc. I feel pain or very uncomfortable. I decided to eat plant based/vegan (though I'm not putting a label on it yet) and reinvent foods I used to be able to eat, and find healthy alternatives as well as just eating fruits and vegetables and stuff. It's literally the only way I've been able to eat. And for some reason once I started eating a lot more vegan/whole foods, real meat has just...been unappealing to me. Though from my memory it hasn't caused pain. 

Now, I've done this before, just not at this scale. Before when I went whole plant based, I would literally just eat vegetables and fruit, just in...bowls. Stir fry. That's it, that was as far as the cooking or creativity went, which made it very boring. Back then I was also anemic so after a while I also got fatigued. But my red blood cell count has risen thanks to transition, and thanks to vegans on youtube I have been able to be SO creative with plants it's insane!

Who are you a vegan for? Other people or animals? I bet if animals could understand that, they would not mind you constantly talking about the abuse they have endure on a daily basis.
The only reason why an omni would say ""she's not like most vegans, she's not annoying af"" about you is if you DON'T TALK ABOUT VEGANISM. 
Which sort of defeats the purpose of ethical veganism. 
As long as you don't point out contradictory morality of omnivores' actions making them feel uncomfy as a result, you are a cool vegan. 
I can see how some omnivores and ""cool"" vegans can say an argument like ""cool vegans are the ones who don't force their lifestyle onto others"" which is bullshit that some vegans believe.

If you see a person kicking a dog on the street and you call them out for that, would that be forcing your non-kicking-dogs lifestyle onto them? Even if so, good. 
Supporting animal abuse is a shitty lifestyle and they should be judged for that.

Personal freedom should exist up until a person's actions start hurting others. 
So I will judge until they get it, I won't shut up about veganism and If you care about animals then you should too.

In March I've decided to do 30 days of Plant Based diet. I cut out almost all meat and dairy products and embarked on a journey of tasty and colorful food. I'm continuing to stick to my diet as of today as I find benefits in PB diet.

Together with my journey, I've monitored my weight. On February 28th I was weighted 66.8kg, today me weight is 63.6kg. I've lost more than 3kg in a month+ and I'm starting to worry.

I wasn't a heavy meat eater before that and I rarely ate dairy products. On the other hand, before March, I can't remember when was the last time I've ate beans or peas. I tried to do calorie counting for some time and I'm not under eating. I can reach 2200+ calories a day and I rarely feel hungry, so I don't think that I'm under nourished.

However, this sudden weight drop bothers me from health perspective. I **suspect** it might be related to the fact that I did sort of drastic diet change and it takes the body some time to adjust, but I'm wondering if someone else experienced similar symptoms.

I was vegetarian for 5 years and became a vegan 4 months ago. I am trying to do my research to avoid health problems in the far future. While I am all in for veganism, I am trying to look at it from both perspectives to have an objective opinion as possible. 

During my research I came across videos with people who argue why they quit veganism. There is one already uploaded as a subject on this page from Olivia. Now I stumbled upon another video which also explains a bit why she had health related issues.

Thank you for your time.

I've been vegan for 6 years. I had always said the food is the easiest part, what's challenging of being vegan is other people. I've been mocked, insulted and judged, people had called me names, even friends and family. And mind you, I've never been agressive or ""pushy"" or anything, I believe ""forcing"" people doesn't work because people have to make the connection themselves in order to have a permanent and genuine change, but I speak about my convictions if asked. People always feel attacked so for a time I just smiled and keep my thoughts for myself (not anymore, but that's another topic).

Anyways. I've had a couple of boyfriends through that time. One was abusive and used to mock me, and the other one tried to ""comply"" with the ""issue"" and it felt it (I) was an inconvinience (we sometimes went to vegan restaurants but he still ate animals when we were together, he also said he could be vegan for me in the future if we lived together, but that didn't sit right with me because I didn't want to be the reason).

Anyways, I began a new relationship on May last year. He is amazing, honestly I didn't think I could be this happy. Guys, I found the one. He's the most intelligent, the sweetest, the kindest, the funniest, the sexiest. He isn't vegan, but he respects I am and from day one, he has cooked and eaten plant based whenever we are together. I had an amazing birthday, Christmas and new years eve feast. We share recipes and experiment with food. It is great. 

For the first time in my life, I feel that I can truly be myself with someone. He listens, we often debate and try to see things from the other one's prespective. So I just share my thoughts whever I see something that angers me or frustrates me, I vent to him. And he is always there for me. 

This week he told me he started reading some things about animal rights, so I decided to give him my copy of DeGrazia's introduction to the topic (amazing book, it changed my life, I strongly recommend it). I didn't think much about it. Then today we had a picnic (with safe precautions) and I shared my thoughts on the videos of a vegan youtuber that had made me question my approach to veganism. I think I have to change the ""pick me vegan"" behaviors I sometimes have. Anyways, he listened and then he told me he hasn't consumed animals since last Tuesday. He told me he has always thought there was something wrong about  animal product-food and now that he isn't eating it, he feels a weight has been lifted off his shoulders. Although he thanked me for speaking about the topic, he isn't doing it for me, but for the right reasons, the animals. His journey has started and I feel the luckiest woman in this planet.

I always thought I couldn't be with someone in the long run if they weren't vegan. Anti-speciesism is as important for me as anti-racism or anti-sexism or anti-homophobia. Discrimination is all the same for me and being against it is a fundamental part of my identity, so I always wished for someone who shared my same values. And I found him. I'm just so happy.

I'm currently living a sedentary lifestyle so have been eating 1400 calories max the past 2 weeks and have already lost 4-5lbs! 

About 8 months ago I was getting dizzy so I started taking a multi-vitamin and have been fine since then. I tried to stop taking the multi-vitamin once and the dizziness came back so that further confirmed that I was lacking something even when I was eating a lot of calories. However, since I've been eating 1400 calories I am still taking my multi-vitamin, but now my dizziness is back. It specifically happens whenever I stand up. 

I'm using myfitnesspal and I'm not sure if it's 100% accurate, but according to it I seem to not be getting enough of several nutrients, particularly protein and iron. Seems as though I get around 25-40g of protein a day. I'm not really sure what to do as I feel like my diet is pretty healthy, so I don't know how to add more nutrients without adding more calories.

To give insight into how I usually eat:

Breakfast - fruit and nut bar

Lunch - usually some variation of a salad. Ingredients I use often include avocado, falafel, chickpeas, beans, spinach, cucumber, etc. Sometimes I'll have a lentil and vegetable soup with bread instead.

Dinner - sometimes i'll have a bean and mince  chilli with avocado, sometimes cheesy pasta with spinach, sometimes tofu and chickpea curry, sometimes a lentil cottage pie w/ veg, etc.

Snacks - I usually have 1-2 snacks a day including stuff like choc rice cakes, quinoa chips, pretzels w/ peanut butter, popcorn, yoghurt, etc.

When I look up what vegan foods are high in protein or high in iron I see all the foods that I eat every day/week so I don't understand what to do. I eat 1400 calories as this is what is recommended to me, but could this recommendation only be good if it's a omni diet? Am I meant to eat more calories as a vegan? Will I still be able to lose weight if so?

Last Thursday I had two gallbladder attacks. The second one was much worse, so I went to the ER. I have sludge and gallstones. I don’t need emergency surgery yet, but my gallbladder needs to go eventually. I was told to do a strict no fat diet and talk to a general surgeon ASAP.

My consult with the surgeon is next Wednesday and I’ve been trying to watch the fat. I tested a small sandwich with some mayo and cheese, which gave me another attack. After 3.5 hours I gave in and took the percocet I was given. I can apparently handle a few grams at a time spread out over the day, but I can’t eat at all like I was.

I am so frustrated. I’ve been doing so well and now I’ve eaten lucky charms out of frustration because it tastes good and doesn’t make me hurt. I just want eggs or nuts or a burger or butter on my veggies.

I am trying to get through this and not completely fall off the wagon, but I’m not satisfied by the food now and it’s boring without fat. I wish I could just fast until my appointment.

So the numbers and data it is registering is for the last 5 weeks only.  (In total, I have lost 17 lbs since starting keto on Feb 10, 2021).

I wish I'd had this scale from the beginning.  It's really great, and tells me all kinds of info.  How many pounds of water is in me, how much muscle, how much subcutaneous fat, what my BMI is, etc.  Today I finally noticed something else, and that was that it is telling me how many pounds of FAT I've lost since I started using the scale.  It came to 2.9 lbs.  Of fat.  Gone.  Used up!  

My mom told me today I have strong keto breath.  I've been eating a lot of meats, (steaks! yum!), cheese, eggs, (God, so many eggssssss!), above ground veggies and pork rinds coated in butter, coconut oil, and natural peanut butter, nuts, and avocados.  I'm not watching my macros, because it's too difficult for me, and I'm trying to keep my calories under 1200 a day--  and I think I'm doing that, because most days I only eat one meal maybe two.  I've been doing IF without realizing it, so I know I'm doing this well.  I have not 'cheated' once since starting this.  I've got to lose weight for two foot surgeries, so I am SERIOUS.

Does it sounds correct to you guys, that out of 9 lbs, nearly 3 of those were fat?  I try to get on this scale every day, first thing in the morning. The more you use it, the more info it saves and adjusts and tells you.  It's pretty darn cool.  I didn't notice the info about the fat until today, because I'm legally blind, and it's really hard to see my iPhone and all of the data it is gathering.

As always, I urge you to read this sub's FAQ. It's been my rock and I'm not even exaggerating.

I basically summarized the FAQ plus my own little interventions:

* Try to keep your carbs under 20 a day but if you do go over, don't let it derail you, just keep them as low as you can for the rest of the day.
* Lean into protein. Make sure you're getting at least 100 grams a day even if you need to go over your deficit calories to get there.
* Drink ketoade and use salt on your food. (I gave her the FAQ recipe)
* Weigh and track your food as much as you can. Again, if you can't, don't let it derail you. Do your best and keep going. 
* Use a food tracker all the time, every day. If you stop, start again when you can. (She uses CarbManager, I did, but now use Cronometer.)
* If there is something you really want and will feel deprived and resentful without it, make sure you're already full (if you can) and have one bite of the thing. Count it as 5 carbs (it probably won't be that much) and then get rid of the rest. The first bite is always the best anyway.
* Be kind to yourself. This is not a punishment. It's not that you ""can't have carbs,"" it's that you don't want them. 
* If you stop eating keto you're not cheating. You're just not eating keto. It will be there when you're ready to come back to it. 

That's pretty much it. When she's had questions I've answered them. She told me she's gone off keto sometimes, but always gotten back on with the next meal.

I started easing back into things about 2 days ago doing the OMAD and keto since yesterday. And this morning, I broke the 150 (148.8!) which seems weird.

In this article, you will gain insights into the myths and facts surrounding the Ketogenic diet.

**What Is Exactly Is a Keto Diet?**

The Keto diet works on the principle that by depleting carbohydrates, you will burn fat for fuel, hence maximizing weight loss. It entails a gradual reduction of carbs intake and replacing it with fats.

**Keto Diet Myths/Facts**

Here are the common Keto diet myths and facts.

**Myth 1:** You Can Consume Any Fat

**Fact:** When practicing Ketogenic, people consume healthy fats. If you want to keep fit, avoid saturated fats, and focus on organic foods rich in fiber. To prevent any stomach discomfort, space out the quantity of your daily fat intake.

**Myth 2**: Weight Loss is the Only Benefit of Keto Diet

Fact: Contrary to what many believe, the Keto diet has immense benefits other than weight loss. For instance, it enhances cognitive function, boosts gut health, regulates body hormones, and stabilizes blood sugar levels.

**Myth 3:** You Don't Need to Exercise

Fact: Exercising is highly recommended when you are on a Keto diet. However, to achieve more out of workouts, ensure you eat adequately, and allow enough time for recovery. To exercise, you may need more carbs, and it is essential to up your carb consumption on workout days.

**Myth 4:** Your Muscle Mass Will Reduce

Fact: As opposed to the myth, people who follow the diet while doing strength exercises gain muscles.

**Myth 4:** It Is Characterized By Fatigue

**Fact:** During the adjustment period of the diet, you may feel tired, but that condition will diminish with time. More importantly, not everyone experiences fatigue during dieting. However, if you encounter it, bear in mind that it won't last beyond a week.

**Myth 5:** The Diet is for a Short Period

Fact: The duration of the diet intake depends on your health and fitness goals. In most cases, the standard period is between three to five months. After this phase, you may revert to your regular eating patterns for some weeks.

**Myth 6:** There is no Science behind the Diet

Facts: Several scientific studies support the Ketogenic diet. For instance, particular research shows that the diet was initially created to help epileptic patients regulate seizures. Additionally, the diet helps reduce or maintain body weight.

**Myth 7:** Rich in a Lot of Fats and Proteins

**Fact:** The diet doesn't contain high fats and proteins. Depending on one's training goals, the macronutrient is apportioned based on individual requirements. For example, the typical macronutrient split for this diet includes low carbs, high fat, and moderate protein.

**Myth 8:** Causes Heart Attack

**Fact:** Keto diet encompasses the intake of saturated fats, which doesn't cause a heart attack.

**Final Thoughts**

This diet can help you improve your fitness and health goals.

Hello! I came here to get some clarification and confirmation of my understating of energy source management.

Say, *a carb-burner* decides to go keto. Carb-burner's primary source of fuel is carbs (aka glycogen). Once carbs (glycogen) is depleted from muscles and liver reserves, his body will start switching to fat-burning. Once he went through 100 rounds of hell of keto flu, his body is learning to adapt to using fat for energy (on the condition that carb-burner stops eating carbs). 

And we have *a fat-burner* \- a fat-adapted person, ketoing for months. A fat-burner's primary source of fuel is fat.  (Although he relies on fat mostly throughout the day/night to give him energy, after he ate, he will still have a glucose spike. Depending on food he ate, the spike will either be steep up and steep down (if he ate a bagel for e.g.) or the spike will be more like a hill (if he ate 3 eggs for e.g.). But he will still have an increase in glucose levels-&gt; meaning that this glucose will go into muscles and liver --&gt; **meaning that he will be relying on glucose for some time after food intake**. 

HERE COMES THE QUESTION(S) --&gt;) 

Now, about this last bit of the sequence - as his glucose goes up, his ketones go down. **(1)** Does this mean that he switches to using glycogen as the energy source until his glucose goes down/ketones go up? OR he keeps using fat as the energy source and carbs that he ate will go into reserves. **(2)** Is there a ""max capacity"" of glucose reserves? If his reserves are full (from previous food intake e.g.), what happens with the carbs he ate during the meal?

So, I'm my understanding, being fat-adapted effectively means managing your glucose levels. After you ate, you restore glycogen and use it as fuel until next meal. After few hours your glucose goes down/ketones go up and you start using fat for fuel, then you eat again and this circle goes on until you go to sleep. Effectively, following the above piece, you actually have a prolonged period of burning fat **only** after your last meal (e.g. dinner). When you practice Intermittent Fasting (IF) (with a lunch &amp; dinner regimen), you will use fat for fuel only during the night and until your lunch next day. Question number **(3)** \- does this mean that if you do **not** follow intermittent fasting and consume something 3-5 times a day (doesn't have to be full meals but something that breaks your fast), you effectively always use glycogen as fuel rather than fat because your glucose goes up and down and you do not give your ketones a chance to ""override"" glucose? Following the above - an IF is a must on keto because otherwise you just do not use fat for fuel other than at night. Here is where I am struggling to understand fat-adaptation. 

To the title of this post - is fat-adaption all about glucose management as written above? 

I hope its clear what I mean and would appreciate your takeaway on the glucose management situation :)

Another stressor was waiting until I was hungry to decide what to eat and that would end up with me eating nonketo because it was the easy way out.

Another stressor was trying to keep to 20 carbs total.  I was eating only 900 to 1000 without bulletproof coffee and was getting dizzy.  Was following a group that stated that was the way to go and poo pooed anyone who argued.

Tried to replace sugar addiction with keto treats and just made it worse.

Firstly let me say, I call it relapsing because as a recovering alcoholic and drug addict, I know when I want something vs when I’m clucking for it. I’m a year and two weeks sober, and in replacement of the sauce and sparkle I used food. I’m now 5’7 and 92kg. Long and short, the floor boards squeak. 

I have been on keto for two weeks. I’ve logged my food, I’ve nailed my cooking and I have absolutely bloody loved it. Yoga everyday, walk everyday, building up little by little to the healthiest me. 

But today I had a vision of getting a massive cake with icing (I saw it on TV - the type of cake you want to buy a drink and lick all over) and I wanted to stick a fork in it and eat it until I felt sick and bin the rest. I don’t even like cake. It was never my thing but I had that addict twinge. I knew sugar was going to be tough to ditch but after you’ve given up cocaine and champagne, sugar was the lesser of two evils... so I thought.

I realised recently if I kept giving in to sugar, pretty soon I was going to give in to alcohol again. If I can’t acknowledge and address these addict ticks that set me off and cut them off, I’m going to relapse. 

So I turned back around. I stopped walking to my local bakery, turned around and came back home. Made an enormous cup of camomile tea and meditated. 

I found a higher power somewhere along the way today. I am grateful to be a part of this community and I am so grateful I have a safe space to share my small triumph.

Almost every person in this world is concerned about the extra weight of their body. Thus they are trying their level best to get rid of the extra pounds and they are adopting several ways to reach their target. Some are taking the route of hard exercising, some are going through [yoga](https://www.fitex.club/embrace-your-body-with-3-yoga-poses/). But there is another way through which you can get rid of the extra fats of your body. Here you need to adjust your diet plan a bit and increase the intake of protein food by reducing the carbohydrates. During this diet plan, you will be given a very little amount of carbohydrates and the same will be replaced by fat and protein. Since you are reducing the carbohydrate intake in your body, it will get to a metabolic state which is named Ketosis.

**What Is a** [**Keto Diet**](https://www.fitex.club/what-are-the-dangers-of-the-keto-diet/)**?**

A question may arise about what is a Keto diet. Normally a person takes 50 to 60% of the carbohydrates of his daily meal. But in the case of the Keto diet, you cannot consume that much carbohydrate. As carbohydrate is the main source of energy of our body, it protects the fat content to generate energy in the body. While you reduce the consumption of carbohydrates drastically, the body breaks down the fat cells to make the necessary energy for its physical and physiological works. During the Keto diet, you can only take 30 to 50 grams of carbohydrates so that the blood [sugar](https://www.fitex.club/unhealthy-fat-deposits-around-heart-from-too-much-sugar/) level does not fall and you don’t get sick. The required energy of the body will be generated by oxidizing the fat cell and it will cause you to shred the excess amount of fat in your body. In a Keto diet plan, almost 50% of the meal contains protein and the rest are made of fat and the least amount of carbs. People who want to shred their extra pounds quickly and effectively can adopt this diet plan. Basically, a Keto diet plan is for a month after that you will have to take a short break of nearly one week and then again you can go for the second phase of your Keto diet plan.

A Ketogenic diet is basically a form of diet that does not have the responsibility to give you proper health. It is only used to lose weight early. People who are suffering from cardiac problems, certain brain diseases, and have problems with acne are advised to stay away from this kind of diet. Since the heavy fat content can increase the problems as well. Though this diet is all about reducing the intake of carbohydrates it eventually increases the intake of fat through different foods like butter, oil, and cheese. This is why you require taking proper advice from your doctor as well as a diet expert on whether you can go for this diet plan or not. Without knowing the proper ways of adapting to this diet plan can cause you heavy harm. Eventually, there are some side effects of this diet, and people who are capable of tolerating these things can go for or other specific kinds of diet plans.

**Preparation Before You Start a Keto Diet**

Changing to a different type of diet system requires some preparation of the body. You can’t switch over to a different kind of food plan suddenly as the body requires getting adapted with it. First of all, you need to start with the basics of the Keto diet. It may cause you some uncomfortable moments first up but slowly and gradually it will get adjusted. Since the Keto diet is targeted to reduce the carb intake in your daily meal, there will be less than 30 grams of carbs daily in your diet. The lack of carbs will be fulfilled by the intake of fats. As carbs are the sources of energy for the physiological and physical functions of the body, you require some substitute to cover the lack. Fat is a very good source of energy in the body and in absence of carbs, it will oxidize to generate energy in your body. So your meals should be filled with meat, cheese, nuts, oilseeds, eggs, and other sources of fats. The same amount of fat gives double energy than that of carbs and thus you need to put some low-calorie vegetables in your daily meal.

During the Keto diet, you should keep some important aspects of it in mind. You will not get that much low-carb food here and there and thus you need to carry your snacks wherever you are going. It will cause you a sense of unfulfillment many a time after you eat meals as carbs help to secrete the hormone that gives you the signal that you are done with your food. Taking too much protein diet will definitely cause you some change in the chemical as well as fluid balance in your body. It will also affect the balance of minerals in your body too. There you may have to take enough salt as well as electrolytes from outside too to keep your body hydrated. If you want your Keto diet to work faster, then you can use some Keto salt supplements too. There may be several obstacles in your road to [weight loss](https://www.fitex.club/healthy-weight-loss-diet-within-budget/) through the Keto diet, but you need to stay focused and not lose hope.

**Things That You Can Take during Your Keto Diet**

Since you are not taking carbs in ample amounts, you need to take such foods that will keep you filled. Without a proper amount of food you may feel starving as well as due to lack of satisfaction after eating, you may have mood swings as well.

**1. Meat**

Meat is a very good source of protein. It will help you to build your muscles and shred extra fats in your body. There are varieties of meat that are available in the market. Most people who are on the journey of weight loss try to avoid red meat like mutton, beef, pork, and so on. But here in the Keto diet, you can easily go for all kinds of meats. In other weight-loss diets, the experts recommend only boiled meat so that no extra oil can get in. but in this case, you can go for your favorite dishes made of chicken or mutton or beef and no one is going to stop you since along with protein, you also need ample amounts of fat too.

**2. Fish**

Sea fishes can be very good sources of high protein and essential fatty acids. They are actually very tasty and are very good for heart health. On the other hand, it will provide the necessary amount of protein as well as fat content required for the Keto diet plan. Salmon, tuna, mackerel, trout can be very good options for those who are going through their Keto diet plan.

**3. Dairy Products**

Milk and dairy products are very essential in this case of diet. Milk contains almost all kinds of micro-nutrients which are really necessary. It also will give you some amount of carbs along with fat too. Other than that, cheese, butter, and creams can be beneficial for the person going through the Keto diet.

**4. Nuts and Oilseeds**

These are very important parts of the Keto diet since they contain essential fat contents for your health. Almonds, walnuts, cashew, peanut along with flaxseed, pumpkin seeds are very healthy ingredients in Keto diets. You can take them through your meal as they will provide you the necessary amount of good fats to keep your internal organs healthy.

**5. Vegetables**

Filled with vitamins and minerals, vegetables are very much needed for those who are going through the Keto diet. Vegetables will keep your stomach full and the dietary fibers present in them will definitely keep your stomach healthy. Vegetables of different colors will provide you different types of vitamins as well as minerals too. On the other hand, they will give you some amount of carbohydrates as well. If you are looking for some change of test of your mouth, then these veggies will definitely provide you with a different kind of test.

**Foods That You Should Avoid during the Keto Diet**

When you are going through a Keto diet you need to take proper food enriched in protein and fat but the only thing you should avoid is carbohydrates. Most of the snacks available in the market are full of carbohydrates. Though there are different types of carbohydrates, still the snacks are mostly made of simple carbs that get into the body and assimilate easily to release energy. This is why they get digested quickly and you feel hungry soon after you finish the snacks. Some of the foods that you should strictly avoid if you are going through your Keto diet plan are mentioned here.

The first thing that comes on the list is bread and bakery foods. Bread is one of the steady foods of our [daily life](https://www.fitex.club/this-is-how-you-can-incorporate-healthy-activities-into-your-daily-life/). It is a good source of carbohydrates that helps you to generate energy for all your works. This is why consuming bread and bakery products, diet crackers, cookies are strictly forbidden in the Keto diet plans. The second thing that should be avoided is sweet and sugary foods. Sweets are full of sugar and sugar is the finest form of carbs. This is why you need to avoid sugar and sweet foods very strictly. Sweetened beverages contain a high amount of sugar so you need to stay away from soda, different kinds of packaged fruit juices, sweetened tea, and soft drinks.

On the other hand Spaghetti, noodles, wheat, rice, cereals, potatoes, corn, peas, pumpkin, black beans, chickpeas, citrus fruits like oranges, grapes, pineapples, and most importantly alcoholic drinks should be avoided if you want to get your body fat free really. There are different kinds of fats too that you should not consume during your Keto diet like margarine, vegetable oils, and so on when you are taking protein as the major contributor to your meal you should definitely try to have fresh meat. Processed and packaged meat is very much unhealthy and will disturb your goal of losing weight.

So far we were discussing the foods that we should avoid during the Keto diet plan. But there are some foods that we can easily take. These foods contain healthy fat in good proportion and thus you can consume them to keep your body healthy. There are some supplements that you can take like exogenous Ketone supplements. This is nothing but some extra amount of Ketones that you provide to your body from outside. Medium-chain triglycerides give the Ketones a boost to keep your body healthy.

They are also beneficial in terms of losing weight, gaining energy for your daily works as well as they help in digestion also. There are some snack options too for the people who are going through the Keto diet. Almonds and cheese are very good sources of healthy fat for the body. Avocado with chicken salad, unsweetened coconut, nuts and seeds, half-boiled eggs, olives, and salami berries can be good snack options for you so that you don’t feel starved while you are traveling or you are out of your home for a longer period of time.

**Benefits of Keto Diet**

1. The lower the number of carbs in the diet, the lower the appetite will be. The experts say that sugary and carbohydrate foods increase the appetite. Hunger is the enemy of your diet plan and thus if you will go for a Keto diet, then you will feel less hungry.

2. While you will lower the number of carbs in your meal, it will cause drastic weight loss at the start of the diet plan. As we all know that carbs are the fuel of our body and thus while there is less supply of carbs in the body, it will use the fat to generate the energy for the physical or physiological works of the body. This will cause faster shredding of fats from the body.

3. Like in nature, in our body also, there are different types of fats available. There are different sites where the fats are stored. The risk of health is thus determined by the deposition of the fats inside the body. Mostly the fats deposited in the lower abdomen are very harmful. This fat is very rigid and thus is the reason for obesity. While you lower the number of carbs in your diet, you will notice that the fat stored in the lower abdomen is getting shredded very fast. The fat which is used to generate energy in absence of carbs is generally supplied from this portion of the body.

4. While you lower the amount of carb intake in your body, the triglyceride content of the blood falls. It is the fat molecules that move through the body along with the blood through the blood vessels. Thus it reduces the risk of different diseases and you can stay safe from the dangers of blockage of the blood vessels.

5. High-density lipoprotein is a very healthy fat content of the body. While you decrease the amount of carb intake, it gradually increases the HDL level in the body. It keeps the heart healthy and protects the other organs from danger.

6. As soon as you decrease your intake of carbs, it causes a lower level of sugar in your blood. Lower sugar level thus causes lowering the insulin levels. The Keto diet is thus very helpful for those who have blood sugar.

7. It also brings the blood pressure under control as increased carbohydrate is the cause of elevated blood pressure too.",True,False,False,keto,t5_2rske,2364095,public,self,Keto Diet Plan for Weight Loss,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/mrbd4v/keto_diet_plan_for_weight_loss/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': '1uUNJTViTMG1Bow-DPStoZM_JsC04Qi98eaVKSvlDZs', 'resolutions': [{'height': 43, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/FfmLPn6MBH1OQypN303qnS7aIp2kpbP0mhzMEkjugus.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e82b2b496f3e205e122426267a8e3dc4284892fb', 'width': 108}, {'height': 86, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/FfmLPn6MBH1OQypN303qnS7aIp2kpbP0mhzMEkjugus.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2bf03e188ced1bf001221b5927daa561269480e5', 'width': 216}, {'height': 128, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/FfmLPn6MBH1OQypN303qnS7aIp2kpbP0mhzMEkjugus.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=283569308e8cf50e4c22e0a261e740700a2c0faf', 'width': 320}, {'height': 257, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/FfmLPn6MBH1OQypN303qnS7aIp2kpbP0mhzMEkjugus.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=772d4ce6ab22f1adfd4939d686e5a2a647a0b2d4', 'width': 640}, {'height': 385, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/FfmLPn6MBH1OQypN303qnS7aIp2kpbP0mhzMEkjugus.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b3b4626511f4c8f0f4dc6683587ddd325730713b', 'width': 960}, {'height': 433, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/FfmLPn6MBH1OQypN303qnS7aIp2kpbP0mhzMEkjugus.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a71a7e9c0009eeb05741082f0e7834b3592aa259', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 446, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/FfmLPn6MBH1OQypN303qnS7aIp2kpbP0mhzMEkjugus.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=3c4dcbb5a9c4ebff09bcd9e2ec46bea251af3404', 'width': 1110}, 'variants': {}}]}"

I think I have been counting my net carbs incorrectly. I have been logging all food intake into Fitbit, the below are my results from yesterday.

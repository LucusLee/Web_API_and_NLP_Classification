""The first vegetarian society was formed in 1847 in England. Three years later, Rev. Sylvester Graham, the inventor of Graham crackers, co-founded the American Vegetarian Society. Graham was a Presbyterian minister and his followers, called Grahamites, obeyed his instructions for a virtuous life: vegetarianism, temperance, abstinence, and frequent bathing. In November 1944, a British woodworker named Donald Watson announced that because vegetarians ate dairy and eggs, he was going to create a new term called “vegan,” to describe people who did not. Tuberculosis had been found in 40% of Britain’s dairy cows the year before, and Watson used this to his advantage, claiming that it proved the vegan lifestyle protected people from tainted food. Three months after coining the term, he issued a formal explanation of the way the word should be pronounced: “Veegan, not Veejan,” he wrote in his new [Vegan Society](http://www.vegansociety.com/home.php) newsletter, which had 25 subscribers.

I'm honestly so content with my decision, no more feeling guilty after meals and cringing at chicken carcasses every Sunday. I grew up being extremely fussy and pretty much only eating animal products, I would heave trying to eat vegetables. I knew that I wanted to be vegan, and I knew that I wanted to be healthy, so I ate more vegetables. It was shit at first, but I found ones I liked, and I got to the point where I could make nutritious and delicious vegan meals. I realised that I didn't need animals as a dietary crutch anymore. I know it hasn't been long but honestly, it's been so amazing for both my physical and mental health. I keep having moments where I think to myself 'fuck yeah I'm vegan now.' I come from a family of foodies and I was always the odd one out eating plain chicken and rice, and now I feel like a true foodie along with them. I'm more aligned with my morals, I feel like I am closer to being a true environmentalist now. 

But how do I talk about this to non-vegans? I only have one vegan friend, and since being switching I have noticed a very strange vibe. I haven't been met with all of the 'how do you get your protein?' nonsense just yet. I've had a bit of banter thrown at me for being awkward to buy for and having 'vegan rage' (I had a brief rant about UK tax-subsidies to a work colleague). I haven't been met with animosity, but there is this strange awkwardness.  It's almost as if people avoid the topic altogether. I genuinely thought that people would want to talk about it more, but despite a rise in popularity, I've realised that veganism is still strangely taboo. 

I don't want to be the one to sit at the dinner table talking about cow pus and chicken menstruate. I always wanted to be the 'lead by example' type, as that's how I became vegan, seeing others live happily and healthily doing so. I just didn't realise how profound this change would be for me, and I want to talk about it without feeling like I'm making things awkward. I dunno, I'm sure many of you would say that it's important to have awkward conversations for progress to happen, and I agree with you. I just don't know how to get the party started.

I'm down to ~6 meals per week with meat (eggs/chicken). But my curiosity relates to the relationship between animals and money on the basis of Food and Clothing. 


Food: So when the world has stopped eating meat, what happens to all the pigs, cows, chickens, turkeys, etc? Are they just slaughtered by the millions as factory-farm owners see they're no longer profitable? Is there at all talk of reintroducing cattle to the plains and just letting them roam free? Don't these species, after so many generations of domestication and purposeful breeding, now rely on captivity? Are there any plans to monetize the small-scale domestication of animals for purpose other than meat? What are they?


Clothing pertaining to sheep, alpaca, etc.:
Where do we draw the line on clothing? As far as I know, there's a lot of overlap between vegan and anti climate-change/pollution communities. Wool has special properties like maintaining heat retention properties even when wet. In an ever-trying climate with harsher extremes, we may need this more than ever. Do we keep using sheep for their wool? Alpacas? The replacements are often plastic-based and I don't know which is worse.


Similar arguments often arise concerning climate change—when we can make money at it is when it will be taken seriously, or something along those lines. Countless animals are displaced due to construction, pollution, and more. And there's currently no good way to make money out of helping these animals (Overgeneralization, and please correct me in DMs if that's wrong, but please hear me out). We primarily use nonprofits for that, right? Is there yet a way to make money helping these animals we can advertise? Something I've missed? You can keep your business ideas! I'll work for friggin' minimal wage to save the animals and the world!

This is due to me disagreeing with a fundamental core to veganism, namely the reduction of animal suffering by any practical means. I do not view animal exploitation as inherently evil, I believe it must depend on the circumstances. Almost all forms of animal agriculture today are cruel and I accept that.. leading me to adjust my lifestyle to avoid as much contribution to the industry as I can. However, my disagreements lie in the fact that science is leading to more and more ways where we can use animal products in sustainabe, economical, and less cruel ways.

I will use the popular example of lab-grown meat; we are moving past the need for FBS, and the methods are getting more and more productive. I read in an article, the projection is we can create 20,000 pounds of beef from a cell collection. The implications of this are monumental, we could get to the point where we only need a small donor herd per region, the small size of this population will imensly reduce greenhouse gasses and will be easier to maintain these animals and provide them with an optimum quality of life; the only downside is being a relatively painless biopsy.

It wasn't that big of an adjustment for me cuz I wasn't a huge meat eater anyway. Once I found good cheese I was set 😁 

He was always bereft w/o meat at a meal. FF to Nov last yr, he had a heart attack and now he's pretty much 100% produce, no more processed stuff at all. 

But lately we've been getting into stinks about ""making exceptions,"" I think b/c he feels like he's given up more than I. Ex: he started buying honey once the jar we had ran out (like 2 yrs old lol). I told him how it's not vegan, try agave, ""it's not the same! I'm using honey in my teas and that's THAT!""

He's always had fish tanks, but not for the last 10 yrs cuz we didn't have space. So 3-4 yrs ago we started thinking about it again (before we went vegan), made room for a nice aquarium, bought a cheap stand, spent MONTHS refinishing and fixing it, shopped for fish... Then other prioritie$ took over and we stopped for a while.

Now he's talking about it again, maybe a turtle (!), I'm telling him it's really not humane, etc, but ""I've always had fish, I love fish, what do we do with the tank now, blah blah blah."" Idk anymore, I don't want to fight anymore but we already have 2 dogs (stray/shelter) and a snake that I've had for maybe 20 yrs (he was a rescue and I won't have a pet snake again, but I don't trust someone else to adopt him)... but I can't argue that we won't have time b/c this is HIS thing, I have no idea about fish care.

How do I convince him pet fish aren't vegan? Are they less or moreso than dogs? We've been married 14 yrs and this isn't gonna make for a divorce or anything but it will take up a BIG part of our living room, a good chunk of $, and a long-term commitment.

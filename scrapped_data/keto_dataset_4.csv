Im doing 2.5 months Keto right now and I love it.

I lost a lot of fatt and have more and more energy, no more brain fog.

Yesterday i did some glucose testing which hovers during the day between 89-93. This is all included with eating.

Now my fasting glucose after waking up was 101, which made me worried.
I read a lot about physiological insulin resistance, and i have a feeling this could be it.

Does anyone have an explanation for this? Otherwise i will do a checkup at the doctors.

I would like to give keto a try, and I've read a bunch of general things now, as well as reading through the food list with accepteble foods for keto.

So 5% carbs, 35% protein, 60% fat it is... but looking at the list of food, where do I get the fat from and how much in actual weight do I need of it?

Eating meat, skipping carbs by swapping them out with green veggies is what comes to mind for me, but I feel like I would end up eating too much protein and don't actually get the fat that I need like this.

And with the lists alone, I just can't quite grasp how much I need to eat of what to achieve this 5/35/60 ratio.

So I wanted to ask if someone could give me an example of a meal that I could theoretically eat every day that would give me all the important nutreints and keeps the ratio.
Of course I don't intent to actually only eat this one meal forever, but I think it would help me understand how to structure my meals. (As in, how many grams of meat +  gramms of veggies + gramms of whatever the fat comes from) 

I usually eat 2 meals a day (brunch and dinner)
so a suggestion for brunch + dinner would be nice.

I may get there, below there, or be above. For me it is all about how I feel and look to myself, and not the scale number. I found this sub over 4 years ago when I first tried keto. I was 130lbs then, and was just trying to get rid of stubborn extra tummy flab. I got down to 122 and still had it, but that's a whole 'nother post. I did not phase carbs back in, and just started eating like I did prior to keto. Add in stress from a really shitty job, anxiety and depression and you get to me at 170lbs. Then I finally got a new non stressful job and COVID lockdowns happened. We ate out the whole time and maybe cooked 3-4 times. Once we were allowed back at work I was just ordering door dash because I am lazy and it was convenient. That's how we got to me at 198lbs. My boyfriend also gained a lot of weight too, and we both were just done. We decided we would do keto, and we have been on it for about 3 or 4 weeks. To me it is the easiest diet I've ever been on and I can do it without feeling like I am depriving myself. I love that I don't get cravings or hangry anymore and that I have to actually remind myself it's probably time to eat. My only ""complaint"" is that I miss fruit. I am a huge fruit fan. My boyfriend on the other hand is a bread/pasta/rice fanatic so he hates this. He also hates all veggies except potatoes and carrots. But he is sticking with it until he gets where he wants. To him this food is just calories to fuel the body. 

I haven't started exercising yet, but I need too. Mainly for my mental health but I remember my gym routines from 4 years ago and I was just starting to feel strong and see muscles developing, so I want to get back to that feeling. I have chondromalacia (cartilage is coming off the back of my kneecaps) in both knees and a birth defect in my back (spina bifida occulta) that prevent me from doing high impact things, like running. I LOVE running. Of course I love the thing I can't do. UGH. So I suck it up in the gym (like my boyfriend does with food) for other cardio like a bike or elliptical. Anyone else limited in working out? What kind of workouts do you do? I think we will start by just going walking everyday, and I will add things in from there. I hate ""starting over"" in regards to working out because I hate feeling crappy (I am a baby for pain) for the first few weeks. No pain no gain.  


Without exercise being involved I've lost 14lbs and I'm stoked about it. My real problem is patience!!!! i just want to be back at my smaller size and feeling super confident. A pic of me from the previous keto time came up in my timehop today and OMG please gimme dat back!!! I know I will get there, but I need to stay focused on the now.

I hit 1650 days 1 &amp; 2 because I am half way through the insanity workout program, I just added strength training, and I walk a couple of miles most days. I was actually 174 when I started, but gained weight during insanity. I was half-assing my diet, i would do great 3-4 days and then I'd cheat for the rest of the week. I decided keto was a good idea because there's really no room for ""messing up"", which would keep me on top of my diet. The thought of being kicked out of ketosis is enough healthy pressure for me to not give into cravings! I am eating steaks, salmon, chicken, broccoli, yogurt, some cheeses, protein shakes, some bacon, eggs, and that's pretty much it.

This is my first week of keto, I am on day 3. Days 1 &amp; 2 were pretty good, I tried to consume LOTS of fats (only to realize that you don't need actually need that much, it's all about cutting carbs) and I kept my carbs below 22g. I am also being conscious of not going too much on protein! I bought a scale to accurately measure my food so I KNOW what kind of calories and macros I'm getting, which has actually been nice! I was WAY off from my previous guessing.

I've made sure to keep up with my electrolytes, I started taking magnesium and potassium tablets yesterday, and I know I'm getting enough sodium. BUT this morning I felt the symptoms of a hangover. Usually when I drink alcohol, I take magnesium and potassium tablets, eat food, and drink plenty of water before I fall asleep- and usually I feel fine. BUT THIS MORNING I FELT HUNGOVER, even though I've been keeping up with water intake and electrolytes!

ALSO, I've been feeling very anxious, and my awareness has changed. I feel like my world is just off. Like something happened that made my life super different. Then I started to doubt the entire diet. I was like ""is this healthy?"" ""am I putting myself in danger?"" ""I am challenging my body too hard?"". Idk I kept thinking about this as artificial scarcity, I guess there's a lot of fear based stuff in the media about this diet that's making me doubt this whole thing. Has ANYONE gone through this?

There are so many new folks that get railed by asshats that have convinced themselves anything processed is anti keto. And I believe these folks hurt the keto community.

In the last 30 years I’ve been always overweight.

I went trough a lot of different trials in order to go down with my weight. In 2013 I tried Dukan and I’ve got good results with -40lbs loss. That nutrition was very difficult to maintain, moreover I had also few health negative consequences. After I interrupted it, I bounced back to 260lbs. Then I tried a low-cal balanced diet I had a relatively lower weight loss and It was again very difficult to follow this kind of nutrition.

My dream has been to go back under 220lbs (100kg). I was really upset that even though in the past I got the target, I‘d not been able to stay there. I was quite desperate, and I couldn’t control my weight at all, and I reached again and again 260lbs.

One year ago, while I was struggling with my last low-fat/low-cal diet with actual poor results and lot of hardship, I was told about keto and the incredible result you can achieve with it.

I started with keto, and I have to admit, initially it was very difficult. Big difficulties for me was to give up on my beloved pasta and pizza and that’s a real sacrifice considering I’m Italian.

I was almost to give up, when luckily one year ago a friend of mine introduced an Italian brand specialized in low card foods to. They offer pasta, bread, cakes all with very low carb content (around 5gr CHO/100gr). There are also preparations to make pasta, bread, pizza and cakes home. Everything tastes delicious. You wouldn’t be even able to recognize differences with high carb food.

This way I’m now able to eat all my beloved dishes keeping my carbohydrate lower than 25gr a day.

Eating in such a way eventually I hit my target few months ago and I’m going further down. My current weight is 210lbs (95Kg)

I do back to back water fasting, and keto on eating days. I eat virtually no sugar on keto not even artificial sugar.

So I had that for lunch, and the same meal for dinner. With an organic cookie, half of a brownie, and some chocolate pretzels.

— 2-3 eggs, 1/4 cup ground sausage, 1/4 cup cheese all cooked in avocado oil (1 TBSP)
— keto brand sea salt ice cream bar with 1 tsp of peanut butter
— 2 rounds of babybel cheese
— 1 TBSP of MCT oil
— Water, lots

I've been doing keto for a little over a month now, and I've lost 20 pounds! I'm so happy! But recently, within the last week my calves keep almost/actually cramping on me, and it hurts like hell.

After a bit of research I found out this is caused by keto. What does everyone recommend? I hate hate hate calf cramps and wanna do my very best to avoid them at all costs, because I'm on keto for the long run here.

We like everyone else decided to try it.  The 1st week went well, I lost 7lb and my friend lost 8lb (not that we are competing or anything).  So far so good, right? Well into my 3rd week I lost 2lb and my friend gained 5lb.  In the meantime both my brother and my mom got on the kick and the same thing happened to them.  They lost a good amount of weight the 1st 2 weeks and then it slowed down drastically.  After talking with my brother, his friend (in the nutrition field) mentioned a different approach that basically outlined the do's and don't with this kind of diet and set him up with a ""eating"" plan.  Did it work? Yes. Do I have a friend that is willing to set up a personal ""eating"" plan for me? The answer is no.  Do I want to pay someone tons of money to tell me how to eat? Also no. But I did some research and there is tons of it on the internet.  I've been reading the forums, articles, posts, you name it.  Everything I came across had conflicting info.  So the same friend that got me started on this Keto life style found the Keto Resource and the 28 day Keto online.  He swears by it, and he didn't have to pay someone tons of money.  So what did I do? I paid the $37 (it was on sale) and I signed up for the ""challenge"", I figured why not.  Its cheap and if it works, even better. So far I changed my eating habits and I feel less bloated and not as hungry.  Here is the link if anyone is interested, I figured I'd share and maybe it will help some more people out.

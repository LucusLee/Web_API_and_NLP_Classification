My question is for folks who actively supplement with iron. I’ve been vegan for about 7 years and mainly vegetarian for many years before that. Recently, after experiencing a myriad of symptoms, I discovered I had low ferritin (26), where anything under 30 is an absolute iron deficiency. 

Admittedly I wasn’t consuming as many green vegetables nor beans, but I was always eating sufficient amounts of tofu. 

So! For those of you who are aware of your iron levels and are consciously trying to raise them or simply maintain them; what supplement do you take? 

I’ve been taking Spatone but it’s a measly 5mg so that likely won’t help me much. Thus I’m in the market for a vegan friendly iron that won’t overload me but be something I can take consistently and sustainably.

The problem is, that his behaviour strains his relationship with our family and others. He always asks me ""when will you go fully vegan?"" and any effort shown is not enough for him. If there's a vegan option for him, it's not enough, cause the whole table should be vegan. 
A couple of weeks ago, my parents went to visit him in his flat. They brought homemade pizza and when he realised, that some pieces my parents ate had cheese on them (the plantbased cheese had run out), he kicked them out. ""There will be no slavery under my roof"". 

Now, our Easter brunch is supposed to be tomorrow. He told us he won't be attending, as long as there is a single animal product on the table. And it's not like there will be a Suckling pig or anything, it's just about a couple of eggs and some mayonnaise.

I've been vegan just over a year and went to the dentist yesterday. First thing they asked me was are you a smoker (no)then do you drink red wine (said no, truth is of course yes but only seldom, and basically never this past year) do you drink tea, coffee (no, no)

What they were getting at of course is that my teeth were yellowish or perhaps a bit yellower than is usual (this makes it sound like they were in an awful state which I don't believe, but I guess dentists have different standards to us lay people). They booked me in to have my teeth properly cleaned by the dentist next week.

Found it a bit perplexing, thought it must just have been that it had been a while since I had had that kind of ""dentist cleaning"" done. I brush and floss religiously but perhaps you can never quite keep on top of it...

Brushing my teeth last night though I remembered every day I put Turmeric powder in my porridge, and it sure stains the whole bowl of porridge. I reckon that's it, and I'm gonna look up pills or capsules so I can have all the health benefits of Turmeric without making teeth yellow.

And I don’t want to buy that pre made shit. Maybe for every now and then. 
Also, I’m not even vegetarian, so I assume there must be some kind of weening off period. Also some recipes would be nice. 

Side note: Pre covid during my yoga teacher training we went on a retreat and meals were provided. To avoid any cross contamination the meals were vegan and though delicious, not filling for long.

Those ""vegans for health"" are not vegans but plant-based people. They are doing it for themselves, not to help animals or environment,albeit they do help animals and environment through their choices. That's accidental not purposeful. 

However, health reasons alone are not enough to forgo leather, wool, honey or search for vegan cosmetics etc. Unless you are allergic to those materials or animal ingredients.

If they choose to go fully vegan then they are no longer vegans for health only.

Almost done with week #3 of my first keto diet and IF. I'm working with a trainer and he's got me on strict daily macros: 31 carbs or less, 114 fat, 170 protein, about 1830 calories. While I've adopted to some aspects of the diet pretty well (I love a big lunch with meat, cheese and avocado and the return of red meat to my diet) but I have YET to fully hit my macros. I've come close; like today I'm closing in on 240 calories to go with 72P, 7F, 5C remaining. But that's rare, and what I've noticed is that I get in trouble towards the end of the day when I still have 400-500 calories left with a decent amount of P and F too yet no Carbs left to spend. I find myself PANICKING and trying to find something fatty to ingest right before my fasting cutoff; I've done everything from melting down coconut oil with peanut butter to making an after-dinner smoothie of protein powder and MCT oil. And don't think I haven't contemplated eating half a stick of butter out of desperation.

I know some of this is my old mindset – too few calories during ""sensible"" meals while supplementing with carb-heavy snacks – and trying to retrain myself to eat heavier meals. I also realize that I could be meal-prepping more so that I have good stuff on hand to snack on, whether it be hard-boiled eggs or homemade fat bombs. But I'm curious to know what y'all do to make sure you hit your daily goals and how you fill yourselves up at the end of the day if you're too far under.

I've tried Keto several times before over they years and lost 10 ish pound before falling off the wagon each time.  
I started reading this sub in late 2020 for inspiration and to learn.  2020 was hard for me like everyone, which caused some stress baking and the correlating stress eating.  In addition I had a severe 2nd degree ankle sprain in January 2020, followed by a horrible bout of sciatica in October 2020 that plagued me into the new year.  I was sick and tired of feeling sick, and tired and painful, and I knew my weight of 205 lbs at 5'5"" and age 40 wasn't helping things at all.  I knew I needed to shed some pounds to be able to get active without pain.  
I made the lifestyle change one random day in mid January 2021 (I don't remember exactly which day, I just remember which week).  I stayed on top of my electrolytes and macros with CarbManager and while the first week was hard, after that I was feeling pretty good.  Minimal keto flu.  Then, the positive changes started.
I previously suffered a form of insomnia (couldn't STAY asleep through the night), which disappeared pretty quickly.  I live with ADHD which I've never needed to medicate to function, but HOLY MOLY, I have a mental clarity that I have never known before.  My back pain and ankle pain have basically disappeared.  Whether it's directly due to weight loss, or reduction in inflammation, I don't know, and I don't care either.  No matter how you slice it, this lifestyle is doing amazing things for me.
So, this gal sat at 205lbs somewhere in mid January.  Yesterday, I broke through 180 to land at 178.6.  I credit reading the great advice and motivational stories on this sub with my success. I was stuck around 184 for a couple of weeks until I read here that I should recalculate my macros every 10lbs down, and that really the only macro I needed to hit or exceed was protein and to eat fat to satiety rather than trying to hit the macro.  These 2 things together made the scale move down again.  I started obese, and as of yesterday I'm down to the overweight category (though, I believe BMI is mostly bullshit, but I don't have body fat calipers or anything else to help me calculate where I'm at health wise) and have reduced some health risk factors!  
My first goal is to get to 170lbs: still overweight, but I feel it's a midway marker for me.  My ultimate goal is to get to about 140 lbs and feeling STRONG. I may go to maintenance sooner if I feel ""I've made it"", because I don't want to be skinny; I want to be strong, healthy and confident.

Ex:  I just had a Dexascan.  This helped me figure out the right amount of protein to maintain lean body mass.  My smart scale estimated 10% higher lean body mass.   Not needing needing as much protein helps me not go over total calories and fat grams. 

**2) If you meet with a specialist doctor related to your Keto diet and fitness goals, how did you approach researching this?** 

I'd like to meet with a doctor periodically to assess progress and changes given my specific situation.

Since  most doctors are now Zoom-friendly, the scope of my search can be US-wide, not just where I live in Austin Texas.

Ideal qualifications: 

1)  **Keto** knowledgeable / friendly

2)  **Fitness** and **weight training** knowledgeable 

3)  Able to prescribe specific medical **tests**,  
Ex: resting metabolic rate,  continuous glucose monitoring to see what I respond to the most, that food inflammation marker test, etc

\#3 is the main reason I need this person to be a doctor. 

I'm meeting with a dietician but she can't prescribe anything, even just for FSA reimbursement.

4) Ideally this person would be an **endocrinologist** or endo-smart because my thyroid was removed.

Cut to a month before the pandemic got serious. I started up keto with my gf at the time. Really serious with it, counting calories and meal prepping. Who would of thought it could be successful if you dedicate to it. A few months into the pandemic with Lockdown in full force. I'm down probably 40 or so lbs. Relationship ended and she moved out but that motivated me for some reason and about September or so I was at a huge milestone of almost being under 200lbs! I started at nearly 280.

I costed for another could months and got really close to getting into the 100s! I'm pretty sure there was a month where I was depressed and lost motivation so I got off of keto thinking I could control my calorie intake and start working out. This didn't work out, my urge to overeat came back and I fully fell off the wagon. So that was 4 or so months back. I'm back up to around 260. I'm living in a new apartment, got my first vaccine coming up finally. Things may go back to normal. I'm currently on a business trip which requires me to live from a hotel for a couple weeks at a time. I'm ready to go back to keto and finally get under 200. I know it's possible! I think I may just have to stay on keto forever otherwise I just eat eat eat. Keto kept my hunger in check. I was hoping that this summer I would be beach ready but I got knocked on my ass.

My father died at 57 from a heart attack, I have heart disease in my family. I need to become healthier otherwise I won't last longer.

It was working pretty good. My starting weight back then was 337ibs, and the lowest I got was 330.2, but I settled in around 332 and could never really get below that. With a little bit of frustration I broke my diet, and decided if I'm going to start eating badly again, start IF. So I've been doing IF for a bout a week now. Last time I had weighed myself I shot up to 340 ibs. So I thought I'd give that keto a try.

I've been on it for two days now, and mostly been doing dirty keto (basically getting fast food and ditching the buns and ketchup) and staying below 2000 calories for the last two days. I was shocked to see yesterday I was 335 ibs, and even more so this morning when I was 332 ibs. I'm sure most of it is just water weight, and of course if I was 100 ibs lighter the drop wouldn't be so drastic, but is it common to see this sort of dramatic weight loss in the first couple of days? Day 1 I did a bodyweight routine my trainer sent me and went for a walk for about 30 minutes, but yesterday I don't think I broke 2,000 steps on my tracker. 

As an aside though, I'm pretty okay with keto for the most part. I've had some sleeping problems ( **sparatic** napping during the day yesterday, couldn't sleep until 2 in the night.) but I've also read that reintroducing carbs too fast is bad and that it should be done over two weeks. There's a video game I'm looking forward to in early May, and while losing weight you sort of need to pick your battles, that release weekend I'm going to enjoy myself within reason. So I'm thinking of keeping my IF as is, and keeping calories under 2000 ibs throughout April, enjoy myself when my game is released, then try to reintroduce keto throughout May.

I won't be doing dirty keto when I return though.

(FEEL FREE TO SKIP THIS PARAGRAPH AS IT IS BACKSTORY BUT IS NOT NEEDED):&gt;! I have always been thin. In fact, I often got complaints from family that I was TOO thin. That all changed when I moved to Japan for studies (and I'm still studying. Starting uni next week). I was staying at a homestay and they would cook for me every day. The meals were so big, I managed to gain a few kilos. Now, I went all my teens without knowing (or caring) about my weight, so I have no point of reference other than my pants started to break often. After that I started living alone and got thin again. Then the big scary hit us all and I started cooking more. I took a look in the mirror and noticed that I no longer had that V thing around the lower ab area so I decided to check my weight. It was around 92.3kg / 203.4lb. I didn't think much of it until one day I weighed myself for the hell of it and it legitimately said 99.9kg / 220lb. The idea of ever reaching 100kg just never crossed my mind and I needed to get rid of the weight QUICK. So I tried keto and effectively I lost 15kg / 33lb in a few months. Then I stopped for a few months and went up to 86kg / 190lb, so I decided to do keto again.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

In the past two months of restarting the diet:

I lost 5kg down to about 81kg / 178lb the first month. According to a fitness geek friend of mine, my IDEAL final weight would be around 77kg / 170lb so I made that my final goal. Here is where I need your help. I have been stuck going back and forth between 80kg and 81kg for a month now and it doesn't go lower than 80.6kg or higher than 81.2kg. I make sure to always wear similar clothes, and to always weigh myself in the morning right after waking up, after using the bathroom if I need to. I'm not overeating, in fact I'm only eating one small and one regular meal a day, and I'm definitely still in ketosis, rarely ever going past 10g of carbs a day. So, what am I doing wrong? I do have to say there is not much fat left in my body, but there definitely still is. Is it time to stop and switch to a normal low calorie diet? I did notice that it took longer to drop the initial 5kg than the first time I did the diet.

&amp;#x200B;

Now to problem number 2. I have severe ADHD and take medication (since recently). Quite strong one, at that. One of the side effects of the medication is dehydration. It's bad enough outside the diet, but on top on keto, it's a nightmare. I have a few concerns because I've never mixed the two before now. Could my medication be affecting my diet and vice-versa?  (Not medical advice, just asking if it's a reason to stop the diet.)

Been going great. Today i unfortunately cut myself washing dishes and got stitches. After 15 minutes since the injury, we were still cleaning the wound cause it kept bleeding everything was turning white and cloudy, hearing got muffled. I swear i thought i was going to die. I blacked out for a few seconds and was sweating like crazy. Once i came back, color wasn’t coming back yet so i had to scarf down some left over fries and tacos my sister fortunately had just got home with. Ate the food &amp; Drank Gatorade zero on the way to the ER and started to feel better.
I’m assuming it was cause of the low blood pressure that i fainted. Doctor said it was most likely vasovagal, regardless of being bother by blood or not, it still happens. But i don’t think it was that. I mean sort of but i really thought i was going to die. Like i said the colors started changing and looking out the window it was really white and cloudy, i could barely even see my neighbors window when usually i could their entire house, chimney, fence and even the apartment complex on the other side of them. my hearing was practically gone. I couldnt understand my family when they were trying to talk to me. It all sounded very quiet and it didn’t happen instantly. This all happened with in a few minutes. I’ve never heard of anyone taking their time to faint...

I don’t really know the point of this. Not trying to bash keto, it helped me a lot. I broke the diet today and ate whatever i wanted (without going overboard) cause it really scared me. I don’t have a reliable source or guidance so I’m just winging it over here. :/ 

I’m really concerned about this diet with all the diabetes stuff i can’t get answered to. I only use sources that support keto but all i get is people telling me “don’t listen to haters”, keto supporter isn’t a hater... or “read the FAQs”. Yeah i did and it’s says the FAQs is not a doctor so do it at my own risk. 

Again, I’m not trying to bash but I guess I’m just really sad now i might have to give up keto. I lost 14lbs so I’m proud of that. Doctor said it’s fine to keep going but didn’t really go into. All they were trying to do is get me in and out of there.

My question is regarding the amount of Kool-Aid I make sweetened with pure sucralose powder. The idea of using the powder because of the maltodextrin has been vilified a ton it seems when I talk to people so I'm just asking here for clarification :)  


 For the [Blue Raspberry Lemonade Kool-Aid](https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/2c726085-4fab-4745-88fe-0f8145f6c860.93bc05d0c57f82606b4315ee6dbe3e0f.jpeg) I noticed Maltodextrin is after Sodium, so each serving has 10mg minimum of Maltodextrin because there's 10mg of sodium in each serving. Preceding Maltodextrin is Calcium Phosphate, and if you look at the calcium at the bottom it says it provides 2% of the daily RDA. Under the RDA's guideline for Calcium, it says that 1300mg should be taken in daily. 2% of this 1300mg RDA 26mg.   


So if we assume there's 25mg of Maltodextrin in each serving, that would make 125mg per packet right? So a gallon=2packets = 250mg of maltodextrin. Even if I were to drink two gallons a day, that'd leave me at 500mg or half a gram of Maltodextrin (or half a carb) a day form kool-aid, right?   


Is the ill response to these powders accurate because I'm missing something? I feel like I'm not understanding a specific concept or guesstimating the right amounts of ingredients. I mean, the [Cherry Variety](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/919Gey0CqJL._SL1500_.jpg) doesn't even have Maltodextrin in it. I originally got into this because it was suggested insulin resistance (because of things like the koolaid I make) is the culprit of why the last of my lower stomach feels like its been in the ""pre-whoosh"" stage for 2 months now and has what feels like the consistency of a water bed and extremely squishy.

So.. I started keto last March. I lost 100 lbs in 6 months. I've been maintaining it and losing a lil more here and there. I want to lose about 50 more pounds.

My problem arises now because I've become stagnant. I've hit that pesky plateau. I was looking into calorie deficit but I'm scared because I have PCOS. Carbs/sugar don't do well in my system and I gain weight super fast. I just wanted to see, if I were to switch to a calorie deficit, would I gain weight back due to the PCOS? I know that calorie deficit works, I've seen it, but sugars/carbs don't agree with me.

I know factually, that quite a bit of the time on keto I was not in a calorie deficit - I lost a lot of weight really fast and I was eating whatever I wanted (That was keto, but portions and calories didn't matter. I was just dropping weight like crazy.) I also didn't exercise. 

Now I take walks etc and try to do what I can to help with weight loss but I've been the same weight for a few months. I'm still doing keto so it's frustrating because it's always worked for me. I wanted to see how calorie deficit would work for me (if it would) but I'm scared bc of the PCOS. It feeds and thrives with sugar in my body and I am so worried about gaining weight back. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think if I swap to CD I'll lose, regardless of PCOS?

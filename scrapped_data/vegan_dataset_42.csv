I am from India and here instead of worshipping cows, they are a joke. 

So I was at a market and a very sweet cow was going shops after shops maybe asking for food or something but people were throwing water at it. Maybe they could have just given the poor girl water instead of spraying at it. 

Ok yes it's my fault too I should have stepped outside and argued with them but I didn't because I am not comfortable confronting people. Guilty I didn't do anything.

I saw a cat whose fur didn't look that good sure it needed food and water, but again I am a wuss I didn't stop to do something about it.  

I was volunteering at an animal shelter I got yelled at because I criticized at the amount of poop I saw, it definitely needed cleaning I was up for that but I am dumb I don't know when they eat and sleep. And they were like vegans don't do shit.  

I don't step outside of my house because I see cruelty everywhere. I get almost everything home-delivered, yes that has got a lot of plastic accumulated. 

I contribute most of my life savings to animal shelters still I cannot get peace of mind. I don't even use palm oil products because I want to be as minimalistic as possible. One of the big reasons I don't join local vegan groups is because I am highly sensitive to animal cruelty and I am not even sure what am I supposed to do. 

Can't I just live a normal life without the constant urge of trying to do something out of my comfort zone and I end up not doing it.  

I feel like I am in such a shitty lock situation that I feel guilty half of the time and then I try to do something and end up half-ass it. Today is like one of those days I wanna cry like a wuss and not get out after the things I saw.

While I do find it interesting, I began questioning it from the perspective of vegan philosophy; a quick search has shown that while bugs can feel acute pain ( nociception), I could not find any concrete evidence that they are sentient beings. So if entomophagy could potentially reduce the dependency on meat, would you say that it would morally be okay to raise bug farms? Or would it still be labeled as animal cruelty?

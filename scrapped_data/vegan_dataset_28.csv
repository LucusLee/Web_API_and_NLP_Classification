I have read a good deal about veganism for health, but the info seems to be more generalized, so was hoping someone might have some personal experience with this. 

I have endometriosis and it is not very well controlled with medications. Most people think it's just painful period cramps, but I don't even get a period and am usually in like, excruciating pain almost everyday. There is a lot more involved, but that is the gist of it. It sucks.

I have been looking a lot into dietary changes to help and have even tried a few different protocols myself, such as low fodmap, AIP etc. Most of these diets are fairly low-carb and nearly impossible to sustain on a vegan or even vegetarian diet. I was actually a vegetarian for 16 years and eventually started eating meat about 4 years ago at the advice of my medical team, RDs, etc. so that I could follow these plans. But I just don't buy the idea that eating a meat-heavy diet is helpful, especially considering all of the hormones and antibiotics animals are given, and it goes against so much of my morals and ethics. I am trying to avoid a hysterectomy (I'm only 30!!) and was just so desperate.

Has anyone had any success with veganism helping endometriosis symptoms? At this point I will probably head toward veganism either way, but was hoping for some insight and maybe some hope, haha.

1. Health - I was obese (still working on it) and eating processed sugars and junk all the time. Thanksgiving 2020 I was fed up and decided to make a change. I've lost 20 pounds since and have a long way to go but feel more empowered 
2. Skin - Acne prone here. Lowering sugar and upping vegetables found most successful changes so far

I haven't watched it, but it does come up if you type in any vegan documentary into the Netflix search bar, so I was curious to know if other vegans think its worth watching or talking about (considering how everyone has been buzzing about the new Seaspiracy documentary here).

Documentaries like Earthlings and Dominion center around animal welfare and ethics, so they are really pro vegan and environment, whereas Cowspiracy, What the Health, and Game Changers really just focus on the human experience in terms of health and fitness. The don't really dig deeper to question morality and speciesism. The two documentaries that present the strongest ethical cases are the two that Netflix does not offer. It's good that Netflix has a few plant based diet documentaries, but I really hope they open their catalog to more bitter truths. I'm going to be watching Seaspiracy this week, but judging from the trailer I can tell it's not really about the animals, its about the pollution and industry agendas as a whole. Which is fine, but that really is only the tip of the iceberg. Hopefully I am wrong about this assumption and it really does create a voice for the animals that are suffering and being slaughtered.

Netflix plays a major role in a lot of people's worldly education, just because of their extensive list of easily accessible documentaries.

Being the upvote whore that i am, i thought i would copy paste it in case anyone here cared :p)

This post ended up being really long and rambling, so im adding this at the start. TL;DR i went from meat lover to vegan almost literally overnight because of Alex's arguments for veganism, and the documentary ""land of hope and glory"" by Earthling Ed was what pushed me over the edge and finally made me abandon my cognitive dissonance and excuses i was making.

I dont know if he reads anything on this sub, but if by any chance Alex sees this, then thank you for all your work and opening my eyes to the immense amount of suffering and death that i have been supporting all my life up until this point.

Ive been watching for a while, mainly interested in the philosophical arguments after watching atheist experience for a number of years, and honestly, when he first started doing veganism related content, i wasnt very interested and only flicked through a couple of videos not really paying attention. But something stuck in my mind and eventually i came back to watch a bunch of it fully, and i came to the realization that there is simply no valid argument (at least for someone in my position) for consuming animal products in the way i did. I resisted at first, mainly using a pretty lazy and nihilistic justification of ""well, im such a small cog in the machine, what im doing makes no REAL difference""...But i felt a pang of guilt every time i ate meat. This lasted, i think, several months.

Then roughly a week or so ago, i sat down (with a pork sausage sandwich) and started browsing youtube videos, and i come across podcast #9 with Earthling Ed ([https://youtu.be/r-BTN8Ajs04](https://youtu.be/r-BTN8Ajs04)). I watch for a little while and am hit with the same guilt ive been feeling more and more often as (what i now recognize to be...) my cognitive dissonance starts to break down. Partway through the video Earthling Ed's documentary ""land of hope and glory"" was mentioned (i had never heard of him or any of his work before watching the interview - link to the documentary &gt; [https://www.landofhopeandglory.org/](https://www.landofhopeandglory.org/)) and i was curious, so i paused that video and googled it, and started watching. The pork sausage sandwich is about half eaten at this point.

As much as i kind of hate overly dramatic language like this, i dont think its an exaggeration to say that video changed my life. I had heard before about the process of slaughtering animals, about how they were stunned with a boltgun and then had their throats cut, or how pigs were put into gas chambers. But i had never actually been confronted with it. Never been forced to witness an actual intelligent living animal screaming in pain and terror and clawing at the cage around it as it suffocated to death. Or witnessing a cow fail to be stunned in a setting right out of a cheesy torture-porn horror movie and have its throat slashed while still conscious and its horrific writhing as it bleeds to death. And as silly as it sounds, i remember looking at that sausage sandwich on my desk and something finally clicked in my head and i no longer saw it as just a tasty lunch, but as a lump of dead meat from a tortured animal. And i simply could not finish that sandwich, i even tried to reason with myself that it was just a waste of food to throw it away at this point, but i just couldn't stomach it.

And from there, the floodgates had opened, i realized that if i couldn't eat meat anymore, then milk and cheese were off the table too, since those industries were just as bad for all the same reasons. Fish i found were more difficult to empathize with, and i almost flirted with the idea of going vegan except still consuming fish, until i mentally slapped myself with how silly that idea was. ""can fish really feel pain? i swear i read they couldnt..."" a quick google informed me that, yes, fish have nervous systems and therefore feel pain, duhhhhh. And of course i realized that ive always found the Japanese whaling industry incredibly problematic, so why am i applying those standards to large sealife but not smaller ones?

Ive not been vegan long now, as i said, about a week. But honestly, what has surprised me most is this...ITS SO EASY. I had this idea in my head before that i would have to be some sort of ridiculous ""taste martyr"" to be vegan and exist off of salad and nuts for the rest of my life... and then i had my first vegan sausage and realised, if i didnt know better, I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS MEAT. Alternative cheese, butter, milk, chicken, sausages etc... it all tastes really good?! What the hell?! Why isnt this better known?! As for health, my diet has been quickly improving, im still consuming wayyyyy too much sugar (im far too addicted to fizzy drinks) But im eating far more leafy greens, veg and fruit, and im really enjoying it!

The only problem im having now is trying not to be the ""preachy vegan"" to my family. I dont know whats right at this point, to live and let live, or to really try and push what ive learned on those close to me. I almost feel obligated to try and spread the message at this point as penance for all the suffering ive caused.

He wrote the following about a Master Hugh:

&gt;My mistress was, as I have said, a kind and tender-hearted woman; and in the simplicity of her soul she commenced, when I first went to live with her, to treat me as she supposed one human being ought to treat another. In entering upon the duties of a slaveholder, she did not seem to perceive that I sustained to her the relation of a mere chattel, and that for her to treat me as a human being was not only wrong, but dangerously so. Slavery proved as injurious to her as it did to me. When I went there, she was a pious, warm, and tender-hearted woman. There was no sorrow or suffering for which she had not a tear. She had bread for the hungry, clothes for the naked, and comfort for every mourner that came within her reach. Slavery soon proved its ability to divest her of these heavenly qualities. Under its influence, the tender heart became stone, and the lamblike disposition gave way to one of tiger-like fierceness. The first step in her downward course was in her ceasing to instruct me. She now commenced to practise her husband's precepts. She finally became even more violent in her opposition than her husband himself. 

*Douglass 43*

He later states;

&gt;. . . for, during this interval, a great change had taken place in Master Hugh and his once kind and affectionate wife. The influence of brandy upon him, and of slavery upon her, had effected a disastrous change in the characters of both; . . .

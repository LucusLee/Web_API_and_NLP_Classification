I used to do 23-1 IF and keto and had great results while working a labour intensive job. This was a couple years ago by now and I'm considering getting back into keto again (just started IF again)    

I was looking for meal suggestions though because I really like to keep things simple.   

When I was doing 23-1, I was eating 1 omelette a day and that was my meal. It was 3-4 eggs, 0.5-1lb of lean ground beef with some vegetables and hotsauce and that was basically it. Though I'm less active now (not doing 40 hours of labor a week) so I'm not sure if 3\~ eggs a day is the greatest idea with all the saturated fat but maybe it's not an issue at all.     

I never felt weak on that diet. There were days at work where I was hungry by lunch which kinda sucked but I never felt exhausted, lightheaded or anything like that and did this diet for months.  

So what are your favourite meals? Do you take vitamin/electrolyte supplements? By chance do you know if my omelette strategy meets all/most of the recommended intakes?   

I'm considering keto again mostly because even veggie-packed dishes that are supposed to keep me full just don't. Example: I literally just finished a 36 hour fast like 3 hours ago. I broke it by eating half a pineapple and then half an hour later had a banana and some oatmeal. That is already 500 calories and a decent amount of food but an hour later I was still hungry. I decided I'd make a stirfry. I used like 1/4 grated cauliflower instead of rice, a piece of haddock, cucumber, carrots, broccoli and black beans. Ate a full, average size bowl of that and an hour later I could go eat the rest.

Keto for March - strict adherence except early on when I misunderstood some key ideas and didnt have macros correct.

Restarted on Monday with 1551kcal, 154P/20C/95F along with intermittent fasting 16/8. My weight fluctuates so much that its hard to say if I really gained weight back but for sure beer, candy and pasta were on the menu. Not worried about it. I ran for 45 minutes yesterday - felt strong so for sure glycogen stores available. Plan to run again today - maybe a bit longer - to burn out my legs - then do a 24 hour fast. 

Sound like a plan? 

Postnote: Enjoyed the pasta and goodies but had a decent amount of unexpected guilt surrounding this. I mention because I think many would agree - in the course of a year - there will be times where its just very practical to suspend the strictness. I know I want to continue with the macros etc. for a few reasons (I feel better for one!), but learning how to navigate these schedules is a good skill. That month of being strict got easier and easier, then now, restarting, is second-nature almost. I think that will become the norm for me.

..

I am a food scientist, working in one of the largest food ingredients company in the world. Most of the time, I worked with major (and minor) food manufacturers for colas and beverages, crackers and cookies, snacks, sauces, instant meals, breads, sausages… you named it. 

How to I make them delicious? Through scientific manipulation of flavours and textures.

How to I make them cost as cheap as possible for profits? Using the cheapest fillers (think gums,  starch/modified starch, air, water, palm oil, sugar, syrups), combination of above while maintaining the longest possible shelf life.

My job is to create the most delicious, addictive and profitable wonders.

Now, why the confession? Because, personally I avoid these like plagues… I do not consume what I create. The only exception where I ‘eat’ my creations were duration product presentation and tasting sessions with my customers (I.e. food manufacturers), and secretly spit out on a tissue, unseen. 

..

I came from Singapore, where we pride ourselves as food paradise. And as with most Asian families, my ‘old’ home diet were largely filled with carbohydrates – rice, noodles, and mixing in the modern fast foods and snacks. We were fat, very fat. I WERE fat. We embraced low fat diet think that would save us. Thanks America,  your SAD and my government.

Likewise, when I was in University (late 2000s), low fat is (and still) encouraged in our product development and nutrition modules. Incidentally, I took biochemistry as well, and was some credits away to be a dietitian, if I want to.

At that time, the fat me was looking ways to slim down – which I manage to via CICO, but became skinny fat and bouncing back to fat. In combination of curiosity, frustration and google – I found The Warrior’s Diet by Ori Hofmekler, which then I fell into the rabbits’ hole of paleo, low-carb, keto, The Bitter Truth of Sugar (great video), Ancel Keys (fuck you), and Pure, White and Deadly (great book), along with countless literatures that are eyeopeners and equally suspicious. 

I. was. Mindblown.

Things I learn in school about nutrition were wrong.

I still remember the yelling from my mum and the ‘WTF’ look of acquaintances when I started the journey of keto.

10 years later, I am in and maintaining my greatest shape of my life – visible abs, strong and energetic, I looked good, in fact easily passed 5-8 years younger of my current age. My (2 years ago) last blood test has 265 mg/dL total cholesterol, HDL of 66 mg/dL, LDL of 145 mg/dL, Triglycerides of 31 mg/dL. No V-LDL readings available but I am extremely happy with my triglycerides. My testosterone level shot up too. Doc told me to take statin lol.

My mum? She lost 30kg, very happy and look much younger than her peers too. I am happy that she listened to me.

However, after all these, I still unable to convinced my dad and close friends. So I just keeping to myself now, to reddit, and to friends that need help and listens.

I am glad to take this journey, and will continue doing so.

P.S. my daily foods generally are – blended 2x chicken breast (thanks vitamix), 5-7 whole eggs and big bunch of greens.

I have posted a picture of me at my Daughter's birthday party in October of last year and a picture of me present day. I have tried multiple different diets, pills, drinks, bars, and just about everything else you could think of. One of my closest friends was nearly 400lbs when his Dr. told him that his life was in danger and he needed to make a change. He researched the Keto diet and started it. I was amazed at his results. After seeing myself in those pictures at my Daughters bday, I decided to give it a try. At first I felt stupid for trying another diet that would most assuredly fail. I felt like an idiot eating my hotdogs and burgers without buns, I felt like a girly man switching from IPA beer, to no carb seltzers. I missed gorging myself in pastas and bread, and doughnuts (oh my god..the doughnuts!), but I told myself I would give it an honest try for a week and see what happens. I weighed in at the end of that week and had lost 4lbs, it was full speed ahead from there. The real reason I wanted to make this post is because there were multiple times in the last 7 months that I was stuck at one weight range and thought I would never lose anymore, it frustrated the HELL out of me, but I stuck to it, you have to stick to it! At one point it took me an entire month to get from 247 to 245. I started a 20 minute HIT workout on my rowing machine, 3 times a week and went fully religious on the Keto diet. I gave myself a goal to get to 230lbs (because that is the weight that google told me I would no longer be obese at my height lol). In the picture at my daughter's party I was 283lbs, today I weighed in at 231. If you are stuck and you are frustrated, I came here today to say...DON'T STOP! Get more physical, drink more water.

I'm not drawn to this so much for weight loss, my weight is more or less stable. What really brought me to keto was going on whole 30 with my fianceé last year and then connecting some dots.

So, I'm diagnosed with Graves' Disease (AI thyroid disorder) and pretty much had it for as long as I can remember. I didn't get diagnosed til I was in my early twenties. A little under a decade later, and at the time of undergoing whole 30, I went to get some lab work done. My Endo tells me that my Graves' was entirely gone. WHAT?! I couldn't put a finger as to what happened due to other stressors going on at the time. Fast forward to about a month ago and I've gone down the rabbit hole of ketogenesis. All of the benefits from weight loss, boosts of energy, to possible reversal of some horrible illnesses. A light bulb had finally turned on and I gathered that my illness went into remission because I cut all the grains and sugar (although I still ate potatoes that I'd cook). This was such a wild occurrence, I couldn't stop thinking about finally making the jump myself.

I know I'm going to be starting with simple dishes. Eggs/bacon, salads with oil dressings, burger bowls, bone broth. I'm trying to figure out how to fit Japanese cuisines into this as well, it is my homeland, after all. One question I've had is what to do for the tare (broth seasoning). Idk if I can get past the shirataki noodles, so I may opt out of noodle options entirely. Eggs/veggies/meats will be easy enough, but the seasoning is difficult to put a finger to.

Does everyone in here regularly go to farmer's markets and butchers? I don't want to break the bank too much but I know I want as much lasting impact as possible. I've also thought ahead to get lite salt and mio flavoring for ""ketoade"" to fight the keto flu. I'm definitely starting with 1/8 teaspoon of salt to make sure I'm not overdoing anything.

After wrestling with alcoholism for over a decade and a half, I decided it was time to stop the cycle before I turned 30. In that time I had an incredibly complex and unhealthy relationship with food. I was always overweight, but was able to maintain a active lifestyle participating in sports year-round. After moving to the big city for work when I was 26, I began a sedentary lifestyle and drank over a 5th of alcohol 4-7 days a week for 4 years, and gained 100lbs in the process.

This isn’t a sobriety sub so I’ll skip to Keto. 6 months into sobriety, I began strictly monitoring my nutrition using Carb Manager and a food-scale. After 2 weeks of tweaking my diet, I finally started seeing the pounds melt off. I’m under 400lbs for the first time in 3 years, with a goal weight of 260. I am 6’3’’, and haven’t been under 300lbs since I was 5 inches shorter and 15 years younger. Realizing nutrition was a part of life and not just a short term diet made the whole process much easier and less daunting.

I had done keto in the past and the first week I’d feel foggy/lack of focus had some slight vision issues which made driving difficult (I’d stop to turn, look left, then right and completely forget what the left side looked like). But it would fade after the first week.

This time i went from 209 to 197 in 9 days (started incorporated light cardio at the end of my lifts as well). I felt exactly how i expected to feel, foggy etc. but after about 16 days of it i never got out of the carb crash and mental fogginess. Simple mental math became almost impossible. In the gym i felt great energy wise but i lost about 10-12% of strength on all of my one rep Max’s in the bench, squat and deadlift which didn’t happen the last time i did no carb keto, in fact last time i did keto i was making new person records in the gym. My bench went from 300 to 270 for example. 

I started eating carbs again with each meal but a much reduced amount than i used to. For example half a bagel with my breakfast instead of 2 whole bagels with my chicken, Turkey bacon and veggie breakfast. 

I had to start eating carbs again to get my mental performance back, my ability to do mental math at work and safely operate my car are much more important than getting a little extra shredded quicker.

Did i do something wrong?

The problem is that when I do my macros on cronometer, or search the internet, the only nutritional values are for a *drained can*.

I’m 2 months in and 29 lbs down. My confidence has increased dramatically and I was surprised out how stable my moods been. No more mood swings or days where I’ve felt unhappy for no reason whatsoever. 
At first I found it hard due to me being a big snacker and worst of all snacking on carb heavy foods like sandwiches. Anything that’s easy to grab basically. But once you figure out what foods you can have and what foods to avoid it’s actually very easy to adjust your lifestyle to implement keto.

My advice to anyone new is to do your research. The FAQ has a lot of great info on keto and it’s laid out in a way that’s easy for beginners to understand. Another page I found https://sites.google.com/view/ketodietfactsonline/home is very good aswell. Quick and to the point which is how I like to live my life! No big long article to read just info summarised to help you. I also signed up for the keto meal plan they have on the website but it definitely isn’t necessary. It just helped me because I’m very busy and work 55 hours a week so it saved me time in trying to think of recipes to make and all that jazz. It definitely worked anyway so if anyone’s busy it’s a very good plan to follow

The main thing to remember is keto works! Summers just around the corner but with keto you can have the body of your dreams by then! It can be tough but just think of the results!

Every now and then, I'll get a postprandial BG reading that's between 15 to 20 mg/dL higher than usual. It's not necessarily because of what I've eaten. As I said, I've been eating pretty consistently--I'll just rotate through some group of foods over and over. So this just means that for whatever reason, the same low carb meal that I typically eat will cause my BG to increase.

When this happens, almost without fail, my weight the following morning will be between 0.6 and a full pound lower than the previous morning. 

I'm not sure if the higher BG is causing me to piss more or something, but there seems to be a correlation.

I had previously had success with keto a year or so ago. I decided to come off it as I was working out so hard and plateaued. I lost roughly 70 lbs. 

Skip ahead, and I ended up extremely sick last summer and was diagnosed with Lyme disease. I could no longer exercise like before and depression hit so hard! The only way I know to cope is eating, which caused me to gain back 20-25 lbs. 

My doc states keto should be my diet of choice in regards to the Lyme disease for as long as I have symptoms (possibly forever). I find myself dreading the idea and also not trusting myself to follow through without using food (especially carbs!) as my drug of choice.

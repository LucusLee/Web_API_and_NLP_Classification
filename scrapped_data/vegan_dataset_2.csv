But just being more aware of everything has turned me in a way that I wasn't expecting. First there were these sorts of notions of needing to reduce, followed by flirtations with veganism with some apologetic arguments, to committing oneself to it, to just the 'shit gets real' gravity of the situation that hits and your perceptions of things start changing and you know you're not going back.

She still views cows, pigs, and chickens as ""food"". So materials that challenge that view may be the most effective.   


Hard part: Send me all the arguments people have said at you for why you shouldn't be vegan. I'm really struggling with this. I just can't fathom not being vegan, so arguing this side is going to be a huge challenge. But the better I argue, the better she has to (and the better she'll engage with the material.).

I didn't experience any problems for probably the first 2-3 years I suppose, but about a year ago I have been experiencing tiredness and some dizziness. At one point I was literally exhausted the entire day and would wanna fall asleep at 4pm or any time I left my house. 

I started taking a multivitamin and literally felt fine again a couple days later. I've been taking a multivitamin since then, I tried to stop taking it a few months ago but experienced a lot of dizziness. However the past year I have been eating really unhealthy, basically no fruit or veg and a lot of junk food + plus was sat down inside all day due to covid so I assume that played a role? 

I've been eating healthier now the past few months and want to try to stop taking my multivitamin again as I really don't want to have to take one. But when I look up how to get every nutrient/vitamin naturally it seems a bit pricey for certain things.

For example, to get omega 3 I need to buy like flax seeds or chia seeds or seaweed which is really not within my budget? Most vitamins seem easy to get, there's just a few that seem a bit more pricey, such as iodine as well? It's all a bit confusing and I'm scared that I'm gonna have bad long-term effects on my health if I'm not getting enough of something, but also can't spend a lot of money. I've seen loads of people say that veganism is really cheap and that you don't need to take any kind of pill to get enough vitamins and whatever else, so I don't understand what to do.

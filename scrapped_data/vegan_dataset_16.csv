Not only my own cultures are full of vegan recipes (creole, soul food, Indian, African, French are my cultures... I'm mixed), but the more I travel and meet new people the more I wanna slap and kick myself many years ago before I decided to really give up meat/dairy.

I have some friends from Asia and they introduced me to a lot of their plant based food, but recently another friend from South Korea showed me some pages he follows and I LOST MY MIND.

It's mind fucking blowing that these few types of meats are the center of all recipes when there are thousands of ingredients out there to take your food to the next level.

Honestly if everyone knew about plant based food around the world they wouldn't even touch meat anymore.

Even if I didn't care about the animals, the environment and I still consumed meat I would be lying and delusional to think that meat is just better/too good to give up.

As  you may know, Bill C-205, Canada's federal ag-gag law, has passed  second reading in the house of commons with the support of the Conservatives and the NDP. On its face, Bill C-205 looks like an   attempt to prevent disease on farms, but don't be fooled—this dangerous  bill targets animal advocates who go on farms without permission, but  lets farmers off the hook for creating disease risks. Steep penalties include massive fines and even jail time for animal advocates. This is a  tactic that conservatives use worldwide- make already illegal things  illegal-er, with a view to demonizing animal rights advocates, and  punishing and deterring animal rights activism.

However, it hasn't passed third reading yet, so it isn't law. There's still time to stop this nonsense.

Here's  how you can help if you are a Canadian: Animal Justice has made an  online tool that makes it easy to send an e-mail to your MP. Check it  out here: [https://action.animaljustice.ca/page/78832/action/1](https://action.animaljustice.ca/page/78832/action/1)

While  it is important to let your MP know that you don't want this bill  passed, this is particularly important if you live in an NDP riding.

But I worry about the ingredients in like the tortillas and the refried beans. How do y'all handle this?
* My in-laws are pretty awful and don't make it a point to accomodate me when we visit, but I have no problem bringing my own veggie burgers or whatever and eating sides that everyone else is having.

I’m wondering if anyone has any ideas as to what I can eat in the morning for breakfast instead of eggs. I have been slowly transitioning to a fully plant based diet, but the final frontier for me seems to be eggs. I am struggling to find something to eat in the morning that is clean and will keep me energized like eggs do. 
I would like to avoid eating processed foods in general if possible.

Recommendations would be appreciated.",True,False,False,vegan,t5_2qhpm,586224,public,self,,,Egg substitute for breakfast ?,0,[],0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/mkr3bw/egg_substitute_for_breakfast/,,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

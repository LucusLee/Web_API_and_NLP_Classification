When I was 13 I went from a 22 BMI to 18 BMI in a little over a month because I was starving myself. People started to notice and I was basically forced to eat more until I gained the weight back. Later that year I started throwing up my food to avoid gaining weight. I would regularly pass out. 

When I was 14 I came across a vegan YouTuber and my first reaction was “how fucking stupid” but then after listening and looking at more vegan youtubers and eventually watching ‘earthlings’ I knew I could no longer support the meat or dairy industry. 

I went whole-food vegan. And after a few months I noticed I was at my desired weight (about 135lbs and 19.5 BMI) it took no effort whatsoever either. Months go by and I wouldn’t lose or gain any weight despite not looking at my calorie consumption and eating plenty of food. I also felt happier and had more energy. 

Fast forward to today I’m 22 years old and have had no issues with my eating disorder. I’m still at around 135lbs average and I couldn’t be happier.

I live in Scotland where we have a massive overpopulation of wild Deer as they have no natural predators left.  There are government targets for their culling as they cause issues such as preventing natural and commercial forest regeneration &amp; a lot of car accidents.

Given that they live wild, legally have to be culled by highly trained professionals (at least the ones that I would be buying were) and could potentially be carbon positive given the tree regeneration they suppress while alive and that they will be pretty locally shot....is there any reason why I shouldn't eat their meat?

Literally the only relief I had from it was when I was vegan. 

A few months ago I was watching a lot of vegan media on YouTube and I went vegan again (previously was vegan a few years ago) and it really helped me to stop binging!! It was such a great thing and I felt so good in so many ways. 

Then, after a while, I had one big binge and I ate animal products in it. It's been about 2 weeks of me not eating vegan again since then and it 100% just stems from me being unconscious to my truer wants and being out of control to the binging. 

My stomach has been in constant pain from the meat and dairy products honestly. I think it's incredible how once you stop something you realize what a strange ""normal"" you were accustomed too. 

I also quit coffee 2 months ago and I used to think I just naturally went to sleep at 11 pm-1 am but now I get proper tired between 9-10 pm. 
I feel like the same happened with animal products; I'm now really aware of how crazily they wreck up my digestion! 

Anyway, I need to get back on track so I'm buckling down today and going back to being vegan. I know it's an important thing to me for many reasons; the animals, health, human exploitation, and the environment.

The avocado industry has skyrocketed in the last 10 years, being marketed as a super food, trendy and a status symbol. 

With this boom, comes issues. Most of the US's avocados come from Mexico, where the industry has been contributing to habitat loss, climate change and loss of eco systems, as well as funding drug cartels. Who then, in turn, harass, kidnap and kill locals. 

Avocados are water hungry fruits, taking about 1000 litres of water to produce 1kg. In Chile, one of the main providers to Europe, local avocado farmers are being run out of business because they can't afford the water needed for their crops. Rivers have dried up, wells are drying up and the elite control the precious resource. I'm sure you can extrapolate what it means for the environment and human rights when the water drys up and is seen as a commodity, but those who have spoken up about it have received death threats. 

So what can you do? 

For Europe, buying the fruit from Spain ensures its traveled less, and ethically produced. 
For the US, its not that simple. Even home grown crop has its issues, because they need so much water, it contributes to the desertification of already arid states. 

Obviously, these options aren't perfect. The best you could do is decrease the amount you eat avocado, or stop altogether.

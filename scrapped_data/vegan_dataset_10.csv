I'm friendly, productive, social, respectful, clean, COVID-conscious and responsible. I can be outgoing as well as leave others to their privacy or parties.

Currently moving from Frederick to be closer to the mountains, and ideally would love to find my own place or one with some like-minded people!  


My requirements are a private or strictly vegan kitchen as well as a private bathroom or one shared with only one other individual. I'd prefer not to live with couples, dogs or other noisy animals (love 'em, but I want assured peace and no dog hair). Cats and reptiles, etc. probably fine.

Hello to all you wonderful green people of [r/vegan](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan)

First of all I want to say three crucial things:

\#1 From the bottom of my heart, thank you for choosing compassion over fear and suffering. This is the most important thing we as vegans need to remember and remind ourselves each and every day if we are to live at peace with the fact that we are vegan in a non-vegan. 

\#2 I hope to make it as straightforward as possible that my intention of writing this post is not about an egotistical gathering of attention to and around me and my work. Let me be the first to say that the most critical voice that I will ever hear about what I do is my own voice. This post is because I'd like to stretch a hand of compassion and offer an opportunity to those who resonate with me. This project of mine has been a considerable source of personal growth, and I'd like to try at least to inspire someone to join me. I'm doing this because this is what I would have liked to see more of in my own ideal world.

\#3 I hope to clarify that I don't sell anything, nor that I am going to. This post is not about trying to get people to WATCH my content. It's about asking WHAT the vegan community would like to see and hear more of. 

For the animals, together we stand strong!

\---Abstract/TLDR---

What kind of content would you, yourself, have wanted to see produced on YouTube? 

Is there anything I can help you with to make you start producing your own videos on YouTube? 

Are there any specific topics, questions, or things I can make to help people be inspired to become vegan or make vegans be inspired to become active for the animals? 

Is there any suffering (vystopia) which people struggle with, and I can help alleviate through inspiring videos and content on YouTube or otherwise? 

Any other questions, information, contact info about me, or anything else, please leave a comment. It would mean the whole world to me to get feedback from you.

\---lengthy post with lots of details about who I am, where I'm from, what drives me and why I do what I do follows--- 

So basically what drives, and makes me want to innovate is largely fuelled by the profound amount of energy, and gratitude I get from just the simple fact of being vegan, from just having the flame and feeling within me of the knowledge that every day that I live life, I'm sparing animals from being killed. That is what I fundamentally want to pass on to the other people of the vegan community. I really want to help alleviate the suffering people feel about how humanity is treating animals. I want to help people see and realize that we do the things we do to animals because we are unconscious. 

This is what the brand I have created since November 2020 has turned into today. 

Metta Sutta Vegan Activism:

The name ""Metta Sutta"" is inspired by a Buddhist text about the cultivation of goodwill, and it's something I really found inspiring because it's what we as vegans do towards animals.

This is what I've been doing in the vegan community the last few weeks (I've only recently started being active)

\*I've been active in Facebook comments on agricultural/vegan groups for the last month 

\*Me and my girlfriend started a podcast (Norwegian podcast) this easter - it's gotten great responses from our closest vegan friends and the community!

\*I have invested around 2000 dollars in hardware for creating high-quality videos: mirrorless camera, professional recording software, microphones, website, ads, etc...

\*Recently, I started producing videos on YouTube. This will be my primary focus from now on. I'm working intensely on upgrading the quality of those videos by working on myself, which is a major reason as to why I'm asking the community for feedback and constructive criticism.

\*Recently started a Metta Sutta Instagram where me and my girlfriend will be collecting and posting inspirational videos, quotes and all things that makes the hearts of vegans melt in joy from the love of animals.

\*Recently became active in reddit (this account is 3 days old :) )

I know me posting this may be something that I regret doing ""too soon."" Still, I would rather get some genuine feedback about my work thus far, and hopefully some guidance on where to go from now on and, hopefully, find someone that would like to connect more with me. 

From the understanding that the reason we as a human race do these things to animals stems from an unconscious state of mind, we as vegans can ourselves become liberated from the constant judging, and maybe more fully start to communicate to the meat-eaters in more effective ways? That's my highest hope, and I wish someone has some thoughts about how we can do this. I've read the book ""A Plea for the Animals"" by a Buddhist monk called Matthieu Ricard and recently listened to ""The Joyful Vegan"" by Colleen Patrick-Goudreau. I find these books highly inspiring, and I want to pass along that inspiration in video and podcast format. And what I'm hoping is that if anyone resonates with anything written here, I would like you to get to know me a little better and work together to find out how to speak our truth to the world more effectively.

I'm trying to offer to create a place, a circle of innovation and inspiration that will hopefully blossom into a beautiful space of support and clarity, and my highest wish is that you would be a part of it!

\---

A little bit more about me: I'm 22 years old, I've been vegan for 1,5 years now, and l live in Norway. When I first went vegan, I was met with so much resistance from family, friends, and the society around me, and the path from the transition to veganism to the present day, has been a really hard, but rich learning experience. What I really want to do with my work is to inspire vegans to live happily with the knowing that they are doing the right thing, as well as (hopefully) helping meat-eaters realize that choosing compassion is the right choice.

How our truth needs to be spoken is in a way that connects with those people's minds, at their stage of development, through the heart, in a way that's relatable, in my opinion. 

If anyone is interested in checking me out, I do have a website: [www.mettasutta.net](https://www.mettasutta.net/) \- although I'd like to mention that the website is not fully finished yet, it's under construction. Alternatively check out my youtube channel. I recently deleted all my videos from other channels, and reuploaded the best I've made thus far on my main channel ""Metta Sutta"". Some are English, some are Norwegian.  
[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAkJcRMcWoY2fsJBF5uXCTQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAkJcRMcWoY2fsJBF5uXCTQ)  
If there is anything particularly good or bad about my videos thus far, feedback is highly appreciated.   


I will be actively responding to whatever does (or doesn't) come out of this post. I'm a little bit giddy, and nervous, but at the same time inspired and grateful for doing this.

I'm hoping that I can use the responses I get from everyone in the r/vegan subreddit to better see myself clearly and how I need to align myself going forward, to better help the animals that are suffering every day!

Kid: why don't you drink milk?

Me: uhh I don't think it's really good for you. ya know? milk is made for baby cows and I'm not a baby cow.""

Kid: oh, okay

I explained to her what I said and her response

""well, I'd appreciate it if you kept your indoctrination to yourself when you're around my kids.""

I am writing a speculative fiction story and one of my characters is vegan.  That isn’t the reason I’m here, though.  

You see, in the world of my story, veganism has evolved and become recognized as a major religion.  That’s what I would love to hear real vegan ideas and opinions on.  

What do you think that would be like?
Would you like or dislike religious recognition or protection?
Do you think it would be good or bad?
What do you think would have to transpire for that to happen

It’s definitely cheaper than Deliveroo even without the £20 off. But bit pricey for its original price.

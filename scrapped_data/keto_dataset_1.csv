Last year around March I've lost a job at the same time Covid shut down everything in my area, I spent a month in my bed browsing memes on the internet until I met someone who successfully lost around 100 pounds with keto. I was tired of being in my bed, in a situation I couldn't control and knew Covid would be the perfect opportunity to train hard, eat better and fix myself.
I've suffered from huge back pain for years and lost a lot of money on chiropractors when the only issue was my weight and lack of exercise. (I couldn't tie my shoes it was too painful to bend over but now I can rest the palm of my hands on the floor in that position !)

Time has come.

I hopped into the keto bandwagon and did intermittent fasting everyday. My diet was mostly made of fish, charcuterie, cheese, almond milk isolate shakes and lots of low carb veggies.
My appetite decreased over time like pure magic.
I cut down in half every portions of the amount of food i've used to eat and limited myself to three meals a day, sometimes two, no snacking. I also took potassium and magnesium supplements just in case.

To introduce myself to consistant exercise, I promised myself to do 30 mins a day of cardiovascular training, nothing else. Eliptical was my training of choice, then later I discovered a passion for jogging. I recently ran  a half marathon in 2 hours, I couldn't believe it. I still pinch myself to know if i'm dreaming or not.

I did that, only that from April 2020 to January 2021.
10 Months, went from 250lbs to 140lbs.
No excess, only 30 mins a day of jogging and a stable keto diet (with a cheat meal on Fridays for me.)

I must say I'm proud, happy and I can't believe it.
If I had to do it again I would certainly retake the challenge without hesitating.
Sadly, I saw a lot of people around me gaining a lot of weight during the quarantine and I truly hope my story will spark a little light of motivation in them.",True,False,False,keto,t5_2rske,2367608,public,self,Lost 110 pounds in less than a year !,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/mt5nmj/lost_110_pounds_in_less_than_a_year/,all_ads,6,success,a8bb6b80-abe7-11e8-8696-0ed9e0d77ef8,Success Story,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'cz5pbuY1vJFl9xGIcy2qEmgTPDY--3QDZJ1b-GWkrTs', 'resolutions': [{'height': 108, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/UCTr7lqOhRfUWRWNwvCHjt_j5NeCcpSHBTQOxSlavrU.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78fec3529db901a0cd5fbdd2a7e56733dba4865e', 'width': 108}, {'height': 216, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/UCTr7lqOhRfUWRWNwvCHjt_j5NeCcpSHBTQOxSlavrU.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=001b13e9600ce825d0a28473c709e0e362c66a33', 'width': 216}, {'height': 320, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/UCTr7lqOhRfUWRWNwvCHjt_j5NeCcpSHBTQOxSlavrU.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63e8dafc413e4bb2f1068783d8928063ffe51e63', 'width': 320}, {'height': 640, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/UCTr7lqOhRfUWRWNwvCHjt_j5NeCcpSHBTQOxSlavrU.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f4cd48df4d27d456bb4f03b1653da827312e9d0', 'width': 640}, {'height': 960, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/UCTr7lqOhRfUWRWNwvCHjt_j5NeCcpSHBTQOxSlavrU.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fce8cdba6d79bd83820dd7ecd245a8796f4e740b', 'width': 960}, {'height': 1080, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/UCTr7lqOhRfUWRWNwvCHjt_j5NeCcpSHBTQOxSlavrU.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=995dcee916a0b2571cae1fd865acb9e231c51a63', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 2048, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/UCTr7lqOhRfUWRWNwvCHjt_j5NeCcpSHBTQOxSlavrU.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=298bdedb1a823f265f0760ef7c6c10b12d0afc24', 'width': 2048}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,

Managed to keep it off with on-and-off lazy keto until falling off the keto wagon completely at the end of 2019. In the middle of 2020 I tried keto again but started experiencing GERD symptoms that were first misdiagnosed as sinus and asthma issues. In December a veteran ENT immediately recognized it as ""silent reflux"" aka GERD and told me to do an elimination diet: cut out all fatty and acidic foods, coffee, and carbonated drinks. The elimination diet helped until I came down with a terrible norovirus (stomach flu) over St. Patrick's Day this year; everything afterwards made my stomach hurt and nauseous as hell. Saw another random doctor - due to my PCP being overbooked - said my post-stomach flu issues was due to GERD and prescribed me to continue a bland diet and take 40mg PPI pills every morning. He also lectured me about my weight -- with neither advice nor a referral to a nutritionist -- which pissed me off.

While the meds have helped, my weight continues to creep up because a GERD-friendly diet is kryptonite to people with PCOS and insulin resistance. I love keto. I miss it. And I desperately need to get back to losing weight because it is wreaking havoc on my knees and ankles. This week I've been 75% immobile - only getting up to let my dog outside - because my knees are so swollen and stiff with obesity-related osteoarthritis. I am also tired all the time because my body can't handle the glucose from eating a bland diet, not to mention my hormones are out of whack. 

So in a nutshell: I feel like I am stuck between a rock and hard place having to choose between saving my esophagus or saving myself from type 2 diabetes. I know keto will help **my whole body** feel better but I don't want to disobey doctor's orders by starting keto again. What I want to know is if there are some people here who manage to do keto with GERD that can be managed with PPI drugs?

Four years ago I was 317. I am now 237. I lost the weight thanks to Keto. It’s the only thing that has ever worked. I’ve been between 236 - 241 for a year. My BMI is still in the 40’s so I certainly have more to lose. I monitor my ketones using finger prick blood testing. Typically I’m between 0.9 and 1.9. Most often right around 1.4. This seems average for me even when I was actively losing a lot of weight. On occasion it goes past 2.0 but not real often. 

I’ve tried so many little tweaks and nothing has made a difference. Most recently I slashed my protein in hopes that my liver was doing me wrong and converting protein to glucose. I do intermittent fasting, anywhere from 24 to 36 hours. Carbs are always 20 or under. I thought maybe my keto cheesecake wasn’t helping so I cut that out. I don’t need any keto sweets. I have pecans if I’m wanting a treat. On average my daily fat intake is about 80 grams.

If anything I’ve made my diet better but I’m still not losing weight. I checked if I had ketones in my body today and the thing came back as negative. Even though I haven’t done anything that would be a reason why my body isn’t in ketosis. 

My diet nowadays consists of foods like almonds, cheese, mixed berries, bulletproof coffee, stevia, half and half, eggs, vegetables, chicken and beef. 

I’ve done my macros, I count calories, I count carbs, I don’t eat any sugar but I still don’t lose weight anymore and I don’t know what to do. 

If anyone has any suggestions on what I can do to lose weight please let me know.

Since you guys are electrolyte experts by default maybe you could figure this out. What would you say based on these symptoms and reactions to each supplements? I've tried to supplement and add foods in many different ways and nothing seems effective so far.

Overall symptoms: Brain fog, effort to breathe (only on rare occasions I ""forget"" I'm breathing, low energy overall, threshold crampy legs.

Sodium: Makes me feel just with a little more energy and less lightheaded for a short amount of time. Taking more won't help much. Serum is always around the mid-lower healthy range.

Potassium: Instantly kills any anxiety and makes my breathing smooth, lowers cramps. The effects are very short lived and reverse into worsening symptoms in a pretty short time. Taking too much irritates stomach, increases brain fog and makes me  dizzy and weak. Serum is always around the upper healthy range.

Magnesium: This is a real riddle. Magnesium takes a while to buildup in the body so it would make a lot of sense to assume I'm depleted, after all I haven't been supplementing throughout the lowest carb periods. But I can't tolerate it at all. As little as 260mg-400mg a day will increase sleepiness(will make me sleepy the next day even if I take it at night), cramps (yeah, literally a short while after taking my muscle will threaten to cramp at the next contraction), diarrhea, and brain fog. Tried most forms (glycinate, malate, threonate), threonate is the only one that won't give me diarrhea, but same side effects. Serum is on the lower healthy range which could indicate subclinical hypomagnesemia but I can't tolerate it. Go figure....

Calcium: probably have been on a pretty low intake for a long time based on what I eat. Had a vit D deficiency a while ago, but was corrected through supplements and reached normal levels.

And how can I ensure that I'm getting a quality MCT oil if I buy one online?

About me: I'm still relatively new to keto; I began the day after Thanksgiving last year and have been going great (with one 3-day period two weeks ago where I allowed myself to have carbs before returning to form).  I have lost 30 lbs since Thanksgiving 2020 (due in part to both keto and IF, not really exercising much yet); however, before my brief carb overload, I realized I was plateauing and not really losing much anymore.

So I started to finally keep track of my nutrient counts (I mostly just avoided eating anything with carbs, testing to ensure I never fell out of ketosis) and I realized that there are days when I have trouble getting my fat intake where it should be.  Don't get me wrong, for the most part, I have been nearly spot-on with my macros (60/30/10) without actually focusing on hitting those numbers for months, which I was surprised by, but there are days where it gets out of whack.  (Usually those are the days where I have chicken breast for dinner, as the protein/fat ratio throws things off a bit).

I decided to finally look into MCT oil, but as with everything, I don't trust any company's claims of being great.  I've seen far too much bullsh\*t... I usually go to Labdoor to check for their rating on supplements, but they don't seem to have MCT ratings.

From January 5th to today I’ve lost 34.2 lbs. / 15.5 kg (5'5"", 235.2 lbs. to 201.1 lbs.). The picture shows January 9th vs. April 10th. 

In the summer of 2019 I’d gotten down to 174 lbs. from 230 lbs., then my life situation changed, then Covid happened (excuses excuses, but I succumbed to them). By January of this year I’d regained everything plus 5 lbs., and was back at a point where the weight was getting physically uncomfortable. About half of the initial weight loss was from keto, and I wanted to get back into it because not has it been the easiest and most comfortable way to stay in a calorie deficit, I generally feel amazing on it.

Especially this past fall I struggled with getting half heartedly into it again and again, only to go off it way too easy. This resulted in slower (but still...) weight gain and feeling kinda hopeless. During a particularly indulgent December, and my feet hurting a lot after work days (fairly active job), I started to prepare mentally for a different January. Seeing photos from New Years Eve was the cherry on top and I was looking forward to taking back control. 

It’s now been over 3 months back on keto, and I generally feel better than I did all of 2020. I know motivation is unreliable, but it’s still here in full force and I take advantage of it the best I can. I didn’t start out with any exercise goals beside collecting a bunch of steps on my Fitbit. Only very recently did I start c25k as I felt a genuine wish to sweat more. 

I try to stay at 20g carbs or under, allowing up to 25g if need be. The past 1.5 months I’ve incorporated IF and some 36 hr fasts and found that I absolutely love it, so that will definitely be a part of my journey going forward. This was not necessary for me to be successful with keto or weight loss at all, I was most interested in all the other benefits. Still, I didn’t expect it to suit my lifestyle as well as it has. I know I would never have bothered with this if I wasn’t already eating keto. 

Sorry for this little wall of text, I just wanted to contextualize and explain what I've been doing. I guess I felt like sharing because I just feel so *hopeful* these days, and keto plays a huge role in this.",True,False,False,keto,t5_2rske,2366708,public,nsfw,2021

At the end of Last year, i decided to start Keto again and lose weight.  It has been going well thus far, but i believe progress is relatively slow, and i think i might be doing something wrong somewhere.  So, i am here looking for advice into what i can do to improve the situation! :D

&amp;#x200B;

My start point and end point are as follows:

Sepetember 2020: 124.5 Kg at 43.1 BMI

As of Today, April 17 2021: 99.4 Kg at 34.4 BMI

&amp;#x200B;

So, about 8 months to lose 25.1 Kg.  

&amp;#x200B;

While i am happy i lost weight at all, i think this might be too slow.  I am aware my body could just be a slower model lol, but i am hoping some of you fine individuals could help me improve this \^\_\^

I am going for the following macros ideally:

5% Carbs

25% Protein

70% Fat

1500 Calories

&amp;#x200B;

Usually, i stay just under the macros, but sometimes i exceed a bit depending on meal.  But i have did my best to adhere to this as best as possible.  My main issue is staying under the CALORIE limit to reach my fat goal.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, i have rambled on long enough!  Any insight into how i could improve would be amazing!

I often see the recommendations to limit protein intake to a maximum of 25-35 g per meal, as this is what the body is able to utilize for muscle synthesis and that excess protein may be unproductive to ketosis, as it will convert to glucose.   


And yet, as someone attempting to gain muscle mass by bodyweight training, while eating two meals a day within an 8 hour window. Eating only 25-35 g of protein per meal seems sort of silly, if no detrimental to progress.

I hope it gives someone out there the motivation they need to find the lifestyle that works best for them, keto or not.

My first weight loss journey in 2013 was based on calorie restriction and cardio. I paid no mind to macros since I didn’t know what a macro was... I just focused on eating healthy foods and made sure I had a big calorie deficit while hitting the gym for 45 minutes a day. I lost 30 pounds in 3 months. I was stuck at 166 pounds for about a week before I became so discouraged, I gave up. I hit a plateau and didn’t know how to break it. Instead of being patient and trying to work through it, I went back to my old bad habits.

My second weight loss journey was in 2018. I had hit 209 pounds on the scale... my heaviest ever, outside of being 230 pounds when i was 9 months pregnant with my son. NOPE! I started a low fat diet. That, working 2 fairly active full-time jobs, AND going to the gym, helped me shed 47 pounds in 4 months. My progress went downhill when I switched to 3rd shift at one of my jobs. I was stuck at 162 pounds and didn’t have the patience to break through the plateau. I didn’t give up on myself immediately this time, but I lost it over time and ended up gaining all but 5 pounds back within the next few years.

Here we are. Round 3. Sitting at 204 pounds and struggling to stay awake past 6:30pm every day, I knew changes had to be made. I joined and followed social media groups for the top trending lifestyle: Keto. I read through so many progress posts and most people have done so well with it. I decided to look into this way of life a little more and read about carb restriction. The ONE thing I haven’t yet targeted! I then stumbled upon an article about carb sensitivity and the warning signs. I will be damned. I relate to every single sign. That day I discovered that I really need to limit my carbs and I decided that Keto is probably best for me, personally. 

I started this journey 2 and a half months ago in February and I’m already down almost 40 pounds. This time, with minimal exercise and working only one job. With this new diet, paired with intermittent fasting, there is no doubt in my mind that I will finally make it through the 160’s and maybe even reach my ultimate goal of 145 pounds. A goal that I have repeatedly failed to achieve for 7 years now. With the knowledge and experience I have this time around, I WILL succeed. Only 20 more pounds to go. The last 20.

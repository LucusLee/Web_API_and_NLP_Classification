I just recently started seeing a really, amazing guy. It’s only been 2 weeks but things seem to be going really well. 
Some quick context: when I told him I was vegan he was very good about it, didn’t get defensive, didn’t try to argue stupid things. He did, unfortunately, use the classic “in my culture, every meal needs meat” thing, but that’s something I can work with as we go lol. We’ve talked about cooking food together and he’s down for eating my cheese etc. (Some really good green flags IMO!) 
However, my issue is watching him choose and eat meat and dairy etc. We went out to get food the other night, he got pizza, and ordered.... meatlovers...... I felt my mood immediately drop and he could see it in my face. I’m sure you all have felt the same, we see the meat and can’t help thinking about the animal. I had to work really really hard in my brain to be able to stop thinking about the pizza and move on to have a good night with him. 

My question is to those of you who are currently with a SO who is not vegan, how do you mentally manage your mood and feelings when eating together?? Do you have any tactics to keep you out of that sadness? What works for you?

However, this is the second time it has made me sick. I have acid reflux issues, so it wouldn’t surprise me in the slightest if the fat content was the culprit. 
Impossible meat has never been part of my regular diet because it’s not healthy... like at all. The high protein content/no cholesterol claim are about the only things going for it. 
It’s the perfect substitute for the classic American diet because there are 14 grams of fat per 4oz. It feels heavy on your stomach and is very filling. Plus, it tastes like meat, cooks like meat, etc. 

I ate it last night and I ate too much of it, so I woke up at 5am with nausea/stomach pain &amp; heartburn. 
I’ve eaten it dozens of times over the last 3 years and it’s only made me sick twice, but I think that’s enough for me to swear off it for now.

I was unexpectedly intrigued by what Melanie called ""Witnessing"" in the above book, which if I interpreted it correctly sounded like activism or would you say they are different? I found this part interesting, because I have never been much of an 'activist', because I don't get emotionally riled up very easily and don't enjoy the feeling either--nothing wrong with that, it is just not my demeanor. However, the way she described it as ""witnessing"" was very interesting to me. She cited three simple things you can do to witness if I recall correctly:

1. Eat as vegan as possible
2. Join a vegan society/advocacy group(Second bullet above)
3. Share/Educate others about veganism and carnism

This appealed to me, because it sounded like I could be an advocate or witness by doing the above items plus educating people or just talking to others about veganism and much to my relief she says you can do it even if you are not the perfect vegan yourself (phew! I'm trying!😅).

Besides the above items, how do you witness or what other tips or advice do you have for speaking to others about veganism? Any other resources you recommend I read up on?

I was hoping to get some help about why I can't get my body to enter Ketosis.. .

For the last 4-5 weeks I've been attempting Keto, but can't get my weight to move (even a single KG). 

Biggest problem I've got, is I can't accurately macro track my meals, because I work remotely and eat at a cafateria (buffet) for all my meals. 

I've been using myfitnesspal to track my macros as best I can, this weeks macros (65% fat, 28% prot, 8% carbs) should be working for me. 

I ordered a few little additions to help, like ketofatbomb coffee creamer and keto cheesecake smoothies to help boost the fat, because I just can't get easy access to avacodos and coconut oil.

Look forward to ideas and thoughts on what's causing this, or what worked for you to kick start keto. 

Attached is the last 7 days of macros/calories.

When first start I was totally lost. I didn’t know what most of the letters and numbers above meant. After a while it became apparent. I made an account specifically for this subreddit. I had stalked it for about a month before giving it a try. The current goal weight is only my first goal. I will be setting new goals after reaching those. Making realistic goals for myself first. 

The first month I lost 16 pounds. I started at the beginning of February. I was absolutely shocked by how much better I felt within that first month. No more bloating, more mental clarity, overall I became less socially anxious and never as tired as I used to be! Not to mention the reduced appetite and overall confidence boost that it gave me determination. No more of my reckless binge eating. 

During March I hit a miniature stall. I lost another pound or so in the beginning of March. The scale wasn’t budging at all after that. It went on for about 3 weeks. Not enough to be called an official stall. It wasn’t until this last week that the scale started to budge again. Even though it only budged a pound it felt like a huge victory after it refusing not to budge for almost an entire month. I know, I know, the inches matter too. Although I don’t really have anything to measure inches. But during March I also noticed my endurance had increase as some of you might have seen from my recent NVS evil hill post. Even though I have only lost 4 pounds this month even the small victories add up. Who knows there is still 2 more days to go in March. But I am 4 pounds away from onederland! Been almost 2 years since I had last been in onederland.

If anyone needs a push to start or get back on well here it is. Small victories count and they sure do add up over time. Also on a little side note, has anyone else like when they look at high carb foods they used to love, they just don’t look as appetizing anymore?

I have been trying to lose weight for 2 decades and have never been successful despite my efforts, I have always exercised moderately. I have never been an over eater, dont even like fast food or junk but will over snack here and there but its never been a real problem as I never keep snacks in the house. I have always felt that I eat less than most people yet have always been heavier than most. Every attempt to lose weight has resulted in a measly 5lbs loss in 3 months or so then I lose heart and give up because the process is always painful for me, so then just go back to my old way of eating, even though my old way of eating ain't bad at all.

Anyway I started my keto journey mid Feb, weighed myself after 3 weeks of carefully logging my food intake with 20 grams of carbs. Miserable most if the time and wondering if I am just wasting my time like before and . Then I stepped on the scale and had barely lost anything, maybe 1lb, despite all the science saying its in those first few weeks that you lose rapidly, never seems to happen for me on any diet. I cried to realize I hadn't lost anything despite eating keto for 3 weeks. And I am eating the right way I know, I eat enough fat and protein to not be hungry but I miss regular good so much. 

So I will not weigh myself for a couple more months. I dont feel or look like I have lost any weight and its been 1.5 months, even fasted two whole days. Cheat days = 3.

But I feel so hopeless
1. Anyone out there who felt like their initial weight loss didn't even really happen like it does for everyone else?
2. How do you stay the course when you feel so discouraged,  when you think despite your efforts nothing will ever work for you and you see no light at the end of the tunnel.
3. I have heard a lot of people say there have been on keto for years. Wondering at what point you were fully happy with the keto lifestyle, no longer miserable with what you had to eat and did not even miss carbs anymore? When will I get to this point too?

I feel so hopeless, and kind of miserable because I miss the carbs. Everyday is a struggle even though I have kept at it for 1.5 months.

I have been on keto for 6 weeks and have lost 4 pounds. I've been strict and have only cheated once with half a piece of cake at my own engagement dinner.  I'm frustrated because I tried keto a few times last year and the weight would melt off me. I lost 13 pounds then 17 pounds, but gained the weight back once I abandoned the lifestyle. I thought the next time I'd try keto, I'd have no problem losing the weight but this year has been so different! I've been the strictest I've ever been on keto and i have barely lost anything. 

\-Most days, I do about an hour to an hour 15 min of cardio on an empty stomach. It's not super strenuous, but I've mixed up doing walking and HIIT some days, and just walking and elliptical on others. I don't believe i'm over exercising. 

\-I ordered a Keto Mojo about 3 weeks ago and my fasting glucose is in the 70-80 range. My ketone level is consistently under 1. One or two days it went up to 1.5 but I mostly stay at 0.5 to 0.8. 

\-I did one meal a day for about 2 weeks, making sure my one meal was rich in good fats. I'd drink coffee, eat 3 farm fresh eggs, keto toast with 4 net grams carbs, and i would make an avocado spread. And of course, MCT oil. I reduced my cheese intake and nut intake. I do not eat keto snacks. 

\-Since I haven't been losing, I've looked into whether a few of the foods (like for example, the keto bread) are causing my blood sugar to rise. I've tested this using my KetoMojo to test my BG and ketones 30 min, 1 hour, and 3 hours after I eat. No problem with the foods! None of the ones I suspected increased my blood sugar more than 25 units at 30 min, and I returned to baseline by 3 hours. 

\-Yes, I get good sleep.

\-No, I don't think i'm that stressed out at all.

Depois de dar à luz nosso filho em julho passado, eu sabia que precisava perder peso. Mas eu estava com medo. Eu havia tentado e falhado tantas vezes que simplesmente não conseguia passar pela ansiedade, impaciência, autocrítica, desespero e derrota mais uma vez. Portanto, decidi esperar até que estivesse emocionalmente pronto para perder peso. (Graças a esta submissão, eu já estava mentalmente preparado e sabia o que precisava fazer quando estivesse pronto para me comprometer.)

Para mim, prontidão emocional significava aprender a ser grato pelo meu corpo. Tinha carregado dois bebês lindos (um que pesava 4,5 kg ao nascer) e era forte apesar de anos de estresse e alimentação estressante. Também tive que parar de ver minha dieta como um castigo por engordar e, em vez disso, começar a ver a perda de peso como um presente que eu queria dar ao meu corpo por tudo que ele fez por mim. E, finalmente, eu tive que deixar de acreditar que eu tinha que fazer Keto perfeitamente, e se eu não o fizesse, eu estava condenado ao fracasso e acabaria desistindo. De novo.

Quando reiniciei o Keto em 9 de fevereiro, me pesei, mas não tirei nenhuma foto. Eu não rastreei minhas macros ou registrei minha comida porque rastrear essas coisas sempre me fez questionar se eu estava “otimizando” meus esforços. Eu simplesmente comia alimentos com pouco ou nenhum carboidrato (principalmente carne, queijo, ovos, manteiga) e vegetais. Tirei uma foto “antes” alguns dias depois, mas apenas de frente e de trás. E então, algumas semanas depois disso, tirei algumas fotos depois de ver alguém neste grupo dizer como isso foi útil para ela.

I'm fairly new to this sub and I have a couple of questions that you all lovely people might be able to help with. 

&amp;#x200B;

My husband and I started our keto journey in February. Since then I've lost a total of 14 lbs (Started at 289 lbs sitting at 275 lbs) which is an ACHIEVEMENT all in itself since I'm on a corticosteroid called prednisone for my asthma. Before keto, the hubs and I used to enjoy making yogurt in our instant pot because it was cheaper for us to make our morning breakfasts than buy premade. Since we've started we've been having a hard time finding a good yogurt that is 1. tasty and 2. still keto-friendly. We found some Kroger carb master ones that are pretty good and seem to fall within the carb intake we want but I want to attempt making it ourselves again but I'm at a loss at how to make yogurt at home that's still ok! Does anyone have any experience with this? 

&amp;#x200B;

Second question: Every year we get a ham for Easter and usually after stuffing our faces with delicious delicious ham, we save the ham hock so my hubby can make his fantastic ham hock soup. However this year since we're on the keto train, we're not sure how to make a tasty ham hock soup with no beans in it (his recipe calls for navy beans). Anyone have any good recipes they're willing to share with some newbies?

So a few weeks back I posted here, I was getting anxious about cholesterol and a family history of heart disease. I just kept going, mostly because it just made sense for my body (never - ever have I felt this happy before while doing a major change on my diet, and I followed most of the advice people gave me here). I am a 37 (F), mother of 2, and I still have some weight to lose. These last few weeks I switched yoga for belly dance, 3-4 days a week, kept eating fat, proteins, some vegetables (a bit of zucchini here and there, and cauliflower) and green leaves (spinach, lettuce, etc). 

So everything's going great, but I wanted to ask some of the women here, I've read many posts about Keto worsening your PMS, but my experience was the absolute opposite. I've been eating Keto for almost a month now, and I've always suffered before my period, really bad PMS, horrible migraines, a cyst in my right ovary that sometimes caused excruciating pain (having to go to the ER on some occasions), cramps, loose stools, vomiting, joint pain and binge eating. This month was nothing like that, smooth as silk. I didn't have any cravings (though I ate cocoa nibs before and dark chocolate with no sugar), I did indulge in hot cocoa with a bit of cream and some drops of stevia (don't really use sweeteners at all, but this time I did), and on my first day I'm feeling surprisingly better than I have felt in years. A side effect though, is that a week after I started eating Keto my libido went up, high as hell, like a teenager. I've been looking for an explanation but I still can't quite get it. Is it the estrogens because of the meat I'm eating? Have I always been healthier and hornier and I just got stuck on an awful lifestyle for most of my life? 

It feels crazy, I'm not even counting calories, I just stay Keto as naturally as I can, keeping it very simple, and I know I've lost weight (my balance is broken so idk how much I've lost), but I don't think just losing weight can make me this horny, or feeling so good about myself. Or work on my cyst and my ovaries, and PMS... It feels so amazing. 6 months ago my then boyfriend told me he didn't love me anymore, I don't even know what I was thinking being with him, it was the worse relationship of my life, and as I look back now I feel so different from that overweight, overtired and turned off woman that I was then... 

I'm just so amazed by this return to health, so to speak... I've been approached by other men, I feel is something that it is also starting to show in the outside, so it's not just a feeling apparently. I had sex with a guy I used to date, but my libido still can't get enough (what's wrong with me? 🤣). I can't say that I'm feeling like running a marathon now that I'm on my period, it still hurts a bit, and I still use a warm bottle, but I'm not crying in pain or feeling indisposed. Still feel horny though, that makes me really curious. 

So, have any of you girls / women have noticed this kind of hormonal changes?

But I was afraid to. I had tried and failed so many times, I simply did not have it in me to go through the anxiety, impatience, self-criticism, hopelessness, and defeat once again. So I decided I would wait until I was emotionally ready to lose weight. (Thanks to this sub, I was already mentally prepared and knew what I needed to do once I was ready to commit.)

For me, emotional readiness meant learning to be grateful for my body. It had carried two beautiful babies (one who weighed 10.13 lbs at birth), and was strong despite years of stress and stress eating. I also had to stop seeing my diet as a punishment for getting fat and instead start seeing weight loss as a gift that I wanted to give my body for everything it has done for me. And finally, I had to let go of the belief that I had to do Keto perfectly, and that if I didn’t, I was doomed to failure and would just wind up quitting. Again. 

When I restarted Keto on February 9, I weighed myself but I did not take any pictures. I did not track my macros or log my food because tracking these things has always caused me to question whether I was “optimizing” my efforts. I simply ate low carb to no carb food (mostly meat, cheese, eggs, butter) and veggies. I took a “before” picture a few days later, but only from the front and back. And then a few weeks after that, I took some side pictures after seeing someone in this group say how helpful it was to her. 

I am now 7 weeks in. I still don’t track anything, although I weigh myself every few days because the numbers no longer cause analysis paralysis. I’ve lost 20 pounds and still have another 40 pounds to go before I will be at a comfortable, healthy BMI. I would like to try IF at some point, but I’m letting myself settle into this new normal for a little while longer. 

And even though the judgmental voice inside my head is telling me not to post this, I let fear and shame tell me how to feel about my body for decades. Also, I have learned so much from this sub and have been inspired by so many people here, I thought I would share my story for anyone else who may be afraid to try again.

A couple weeks ago I posted asking for help because I cook for my family and I wasn’t sure if keto would be feasible cooking for both myself and my family. You can see my last post here: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/m0enfy/how_the_hell_am_i_supposed_to_eat_keto_with_a_non/

I knew I desperately needed to lost weight, but didn’t realize how much until I took progress pics and saw the amount of back fat I have. 

I decided to do keto the week my siblings would not be with me to have a head start. It was difficult at first, but I eventually got the hang of things. I should add that this is not my first round of keto. I tried it a couple years ago and I did lose weight but I didn’t stick with it.

A true test of this diet would come this past Monday when my siblings came to stay with me for the week. The food that we usually eat is filled with carbs from rice sugar, bread, etc. we mainly eat Caribbean foods which are filled with carbs.

I am writing this to encourage anyone in A situation like mine. IT IS POSSIBLE TO EAT KETO AND COOK FOR YOUR FAMILY AT THE SAME TIME. Yeah, it takes more work, but it’s worth it. You also have to be creative. 

Here’s what a couple meals this week looked like: 

Monday: Jerk Salmon, Asparagus, and baked potato (ditch the potato) 

Wednesday: Chicken Kabobs, yogurt sauce, broccoli, and yellow rice (replace yellow rice with yellow califlower rice) 

Friday: Chipotle 

Saturday: Homemade Burgers, fries, ice cream, chips (no bun burger, ditch the fries, rebel ice cream, and Quest chips) 

Sunday: Red beans and rice, stew chicken, baked Mac and cheese, carrot cake (okay so I didn’t have ANY of this. Can’t even have stew chicken because the base of it is caramelized sugar. I had a protein shake instead. I was planning to have a Cobb salad but got too sidetracked to prepare it. ) 

On Sunday for breakfast I had bacon and eggs in a low carb tortilla and coffee which kept me full the WHOLE day and I only had a protein shake at 1 am before I went to sleep because I was feeling peckish. It’s unbelievable how full this diet keeps you. 

Side note: does anyone know of a sugar alcohol that caramelizes the same as sugar?? 

GUYS!!!!! I didn’t not cheat. NOT ONCE. Not with the rice, bread, carrot cake, ice cream, Doritos, aloo (potato) pie, pancakes, English muffins, Mac and cheese. And this is coming from someone with binge eating disorder. 

I wanted piece of carrot cake so bad (I like to bake) but I stayed strong. I saw some carrot cake fat bombs I’d like to try, tho.

I've heard friends and people on here say that the reason that they think they start to stall on keto is because of them eating keto deserts. I thought the same too. We were keeping it under 20 carbs everyday, so what was wrong? Then I tried something that I was avoiding. I started loosing weight immediately.

Were you still eating your greens? 

I found out that for me personally, it wasn't so much of the ""rebel ice-cream and general keto stuff everyday"" that was messing up my progress, I learned that as soon as I added green veggies into my diet everyday, I started losing weight again. Immediately. But I still eat the ice-cream, atkins, and everything keto related like that. I do this pretty much everyday. Like, now I eat 2-3 small bags of those quest chips (4 net carbs each (I know, but they are SO good)), two peanut butter cups (2 net carbs), two cheesy hot dogs wrapped in keto bread or one split keto tortilla (2 for bread or 5 carbs for tortilla), and a full can of green beans with butter and salt and pepper (I dont generally count these carbs, especially if I'm under 20 by that point). I lose a .8 to a pound every 2 days. I'll also switch the deserts out with whatever I have at the time, like pecan ice-cream (ugh, yes)

I now keep my carbs pretty loose. If I go over 20, its usually just 23, and the rest is filled with the green beans (7).

Idk if this will work for everyone (because you might already be incorporating greens everyday, and there might be another seemingly inexplicable reason why your stalling)- but I do hope that this will reach another me out there who thinks that eating meat and cheese and everything else just to avoid greens is the move- because it isn't. I learned that the hard way lol

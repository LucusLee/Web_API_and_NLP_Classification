 TLDR for below: I basically use some facts from cowspiracy plus other bits of information I've picked up. I explain regardless of legitimacy of activism, it is the message we need to get behind.

Thing is, the post isn't getting any views and I was wondering if that site is actively supressing it. I was wondering if people can go to the site to at least just view the post, which might help it appear in peoples feeds. Here is the link:

[https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Netflix-trying-to-encourage-vegetarianism-and-veganism-Is-it-performative-activism-or-legitimate-humanitarian-efforts](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Netflix-trying-to-encourage-vegetarianism-and-veganism-Is-it-performative-activism-or-legitimate-humanitarian-efforts) 

""For someone like me, this seems like a disingenuous question. Why does it matter if its false or legitimate encouragement? The message is definitely something to get behind, considering the large devastation caused by animal agriculture. The animals themselves suffer so much.

Don’t give me crap about plants are living beings too; that’s a double whammy considering, for example, that the USA has a population of 320 million and grows enough grain for 800 million people. Most of it goes to feed livestock. All that mindless consumption and cruelty just for our taste buds. The first sentence of your ‘plant lives matter’ manifesto should be “stop the animal agriculture industry”.

Incidentally, the implications for water consumption in the US are stark. The animal agriculture industry uses around 50 trillion gallons of water annually. To put this in some kind of perspective, 5% of water is consumed by homes compared to around 55% for animal agriculture. In fact, on a global scale, animal agriculture uses up to a third of the worlds fresh water. That’s woeful when literally thousands of kids die of waterborne illnesses everyday. Also, livestock covers 45% of the worlds land mass, having the biggest impact on species extinction and habitat destruction.

Not to mention animal agriculture being responsible for 18% of greenhouse gases, more than all of our planes, train and automobiles combined. Some estimates put this at 51%, when you combine all greenhouse gases of animal agriculture and its by-products. Additionally, compared to human waste, there is 130 times more animal waste produced in the USA.

We’re deforesting the amazon, the literal lungs of our planet, to make way for soy production and livestock. Before you even think about blaming vegans for eating butt-loads of tofu, most of that soy is used as feed for the livestock. Soy for human consumption from this area only accounts for about 6% directly. So much for soy boys, when you consider who is eating the most soy indirectly.

Then the health implications of meat and dairy. Heart disease, cancer, strokes, obesity etc. The Wests health care bills, especially the USAs, are spiralling out of control. And its not all to do with an aging population. Just take a look at blue zones where they consume much less meat per capita, they have more health in their long years.

Take this anecdote as you will but I know how real this is. One of my older cousins had a bypass operation two years ago at the age of 41. He took BP pills, had sky high cholesterol and ate meat all day everyday, 21 meals a week. His favourite was a nice fatty lamb curry with a few pints of lager down the pub. He wasn’t even that overweight.

Then the climate change impact of all this… if you don’t know about this, then where have you been? You can’t refute the claims of literally thousands of expert scientists on this matter (even if a literal handful of them claim climate change is bogus.)

Okay, I can concede that maybe Netflix has a target demographic which appeals to millenials and other youngsters. After all, millennials are probably the main drivers behind the veganism ‘epidemic’. But here’s the thing, millenial or boomer, Netflix or regular programming, legit humanity or narcissistic activism… people aren’t asking the right questions and we’re running out of time. A barren wasteland cannot support a single crop, let alone billions of humans and their monstrously expensive tastes.

Hang on, this is not only a disingenuous question, its quite frankly a callous question. I feel a little sorry for the person who asked it. I can at least be a voice for the massive, mindless cruelty inflicted by human society on the animals, the planet and most idiotically… **OURSELVES.""**

I had a friend who bashed me for having chickens and eating their eggs, saying it’s cruel.

Now I am not vegan, but I wouldn’t really have an issue becoming vegan, as in I don’t have some driven need to eat meat/animal products and more often than not I don’t eat any animal products just by chance.

Anyway, I have a Vegan friend, but I don’t know his motivations or anything about being a vegan. He was a lil mad at me for having chickens and eating their eggs.

The only reason I have chickens is because my parents rescued them. (We also have a turkey who was rejected from her flock, don’t plan on eating her and she has been accepted by our chickens)

Now I stopped buying eggs because I know how horrible egg chickens are treated and instead of buying cruelty free, I just treat my chickens humanly. They have a pretty big coop with room for everyone(Even the turkey) and a pretty big run that’s safe from the animals living around my house.

I make sure to feed them with good feed and any vegetables scraps I have, I sit with them basically everyday so they aren’t startles by me entering their coop, I did name them as chicks, but as they grew up they got less and less distinct. I make sure they’re comfortable and happy.

I do take the eggs they produce and eat them and give them out to family so they also don’t have to buy eggs from mistreated chickens.

Now, a lot of vegans hate this notion because it’s still an animal product, but isn’t being a vegan more about the cruelty and less about the actual by product? 

Like I am aware that chickens eat the shells of their eggs(I’ve read mixed things on the actually inside bits), so I usually crush up the eggs shells and mix it into their feed, but I also have a bag of crushed sea shells just incase

Basically my friend said I was still harming them by just owning them, but I really do treat them as good as my dogs and if I didn’t take care of em they would have either went to someone else who might not have.

Basically I’m wondering if veganism doesn’t include eggs because of cruelty or simply because they’re an animal product. Cuz my friend seemed pretty ticked, but I’m treating them well.

I want to add a disclaimer that I’ve been vegan since December 2019 and I feel amazing. I am also an avid runner, and my vegan diet plus my exercise routine has helped me lose nearly 130 lbs. 

Because I exercise so much, I try to eat at least 100 grams of protein a day. I have recently upped my calories to 1700 and I’m considering even moving it to 1800 as I start maintenance.

I haven’t had much trouble getting to 100 grams of protein a day, but I feel like I’ve been able to do it by focusing on a few staples (tofu/soy, peanut butter powder, protein shakes) and not really eating a varied mix of fruit and veg. Most days, a banana is the only fruit I eat. I have managed to sneak in more veggies to my meals, but I could definitely eat more of a rainbow.

I guess my question is, with all my activity, am I eating enough protein, too much, or too little? I would like to vary my meals a bit more. I want to start eating oatmeal with peanut butter and banana in the mornings and not worry if the meal has a certain amount of protein. I want to start adding roasted potatoes or veggies to my dinners and again, not stress so much on if I’m hitting that 100 g mark. When I don’t meet it, I often opt to cut out veggies and add something like nutritional yeast in order to get to 100 g while not going over calories. 

I feel very good when I get 100 grams of protein or more, and it’s been so long since I ate less than that. I’m just wondering if I could be a little more flexible with that number and still maintain my fitness level for running.

At the same time, I am fairly uneducated when it comes to nutrition. I’ve always been basically an accidental intuitive eater, which worked when it was just me, but I’m worried about maintaining my milk supply and ensuring that my baby gets everything he needs.

To this end, I want to go to a dietician for some advice. But I live in the Midwest and am nervous that I will not find one who is supportive. For example my therapist is actively against this decision (I don’t totally understand why; I think she’s worried it’s too big a lifestyle change to take on while I’m also dealing with a newborn). 

I’ve reached out to two dieticians I found online who had veganism listed as a speciality and not heard back. Wanted to ask this forum for some advice:

1. Any other EBF parents who have some advice that worked for them? (Not medical advice for me obvi)

2. What are watch outs when I do meet with a dietician? For example from reading this sub I know that not getting enough protein is a myth and if they bring that up they probably aren’t the right fit. Other topics I should make sure they do or don’t bring up? Common myths, etc to be aware of here? 

3. General advice on the switch appreciated!! 

For context on what I’m doing currently (started around a week ago): all meals are vegan (cooking everything at home), taking b12, but haven’t cut out dairy everywhere because I haven’t started reading labels closely for hidden things (for example ate some tortilla chips yesterday that it turns out had dairy in them.

And my question is, how does this even happen? People are very quick to denounce any type of human abuse, or animal abuse outside of the meat industry. But the amount of people who are okay with animal abuse within the meat industry is absolutely insane.",False,False,False,vegan,t5_2qhpm,590771,public,self,Why is it so easy for people to not care about animal abuse in the meat industry?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/msrbsi/why_is_it_so_easy_for_people_to_not_care_about/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The old Animal Liberation Front website had an excellent FAQ that covered all areas of AR philosophy. I've linked to a functioning archived version above. It's also available here: [https://www.animal-rights.com/arpage.htm](https://www.animal-rights.com/arpage.htm) but the ALF's version is more navigatable 

It saddens me that it isn't really mentioned anywhere. It's very comprehensive.

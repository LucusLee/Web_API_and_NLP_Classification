so i’ve been vegetarian for about 7 years then vegan since about august last year, and my sister turned straight to vegan in about november/ december. the rest of my family are meat eaters which obviously i don’t agree with so it was really nice having another vegan in the family, so whenever the topic would come up and i would speak about how the meat/ animal product industry is literally killing the planet (as well as it being unhealthy for your body) i’d have someone to completely back me up so i didn’t sound like a preachy dick while the rest of my family rolled their eyes, it was great. The problem now is that she’s saying that she doesn’t really have any interest in being vegan anymore and that when the UK lockdown is over in a couple months she’s almost definitely going to go vegetarian because when she’s out and about with friends and stuff her options are way too limited and she probably wouldn’t be able to find food, and idk i think it’s kind of bullshit. it seems like such a tiny problem that could be really easily solved by either making your own food and bringing it out (a bit of a hassle i know) or just going with something you don’t want to eat as much as a non-vegan option but you’ll make do because it’s still good food.it’s also that she says she PROBABLY won’t be able to find food, she doesn’t even know for sure... i feel like i shouldn’t be so personally upset by this, especially because i don’t feel this annoyed about my family eating meat? but if feels like a real bummer and almost a betrayal?? cause she seemed so passionate about the ethics and wellbeing of animals being very anti-cruelty and pro-not-killing-the-environment and now she’s like “ah fuck it life is easier for little old me when i don’t always have to only eat plant based” and it feels like she thinks her convenience is more important that the literal lives of animals and that it seems to go back on the values she’s seemed to have since turning vegan :( i’m probably overreacting i’m just really worked up about it especially because i don’t want to bring it up with her for fear of sounding like a proper asshole/ like i’m controlling her so i’m just bottling it up i guess?? 

tl;dr My sister has been vegan since november and says that when UK lockdown is over in june she’s almost definitely going to turn vegetarian because it’ll PROBABLY be too difficult to find vegan food when she’s out with friends or something. i’m upset about this for obvious reasons and idk if i should i bring it up with her or just let it go🤷‍♂️",True,False,False,vegan,t5_2qhpm,585248,public,self,rant about my sister? advice?? idk 🤷‍♂️,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/mj46ts/rant_about_my_sister_advice_idk/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My midwife was more than happy for me to continue, I’ve been taking an all inclusive multivitamin, which has literally everything I could possibly need for the developing fetus and could be missing out in my diet. I even found out the fetus can literally leach calcium from my bones if it needs extra (creepy) 

But my family and my partners family won’t stop judging me for continuing veganism during pregnancy, I’ve said all I’ve said above , but they keep insisting that I’m being selfish by not putting the babies need above my own beliefs and it doesn’t matter what I think humans are meant to be omnivores (🙄)

French bread pizza: do the same thing with the tofu. Cut the baguette in half, put pizza sauce or marinara sauce on first, then the tofu. Add your favorite toppings

Chickpea tacos: dice some onion and or cucumber. Take the chickpeas and mash them together with the onion and or cucumber. Add chili seasoning, and any other Mexican type seasoning you like. Place in the over just to toast it. I like to toast my tacos a little too! Add some lime!

Chickpea (tuna fish) sandwich: in place of tuna, I use chickpeas. I like to toast, so same as above but once the chickpeas and onions are toasted, mix it with vegan Mayo in a bowl. Then make your sandwiches

Pesto: spinach, basil, nutritional yeast, walnuts -
Blend and can be used as a dip or on any type of pasta noodles. Add tofu too!

Black beans or pinto beans on rice, sometimes I put it on brown rice or quinoa. No explanation. Add potatoes!

Middle Eastern Bowl: chickpeas (or green lentils)  on couscous or rice or quinoa. Add humus and any veggies you like. I also add sweet potatoes or potatoes 

Peanut butter and banana sandwich: self explanatory. I put it on whole wheat toast 

Green lentils on quinoa or couscous: I boil some water, add some salt and then when it boils, I add the lentil, cover and turn down to low and let it sit for 30 minutes. So simple, one of my favs.

Hello, I am newish to the concept of veganism (been learning about it for only 3 years) and I have been considering going vegan for some time now. I overall agree with the sentiment that animal lives have intrinsic value and the fact that 8% of the population is vegan is enough to convince me to participate. I believe that if that number continues to grow, the animal agriculture industry will die out or become obscure and as a communist, all exploitation is bad, including towards animals.

While I don’t particularly like animals, I recognize that they are Living for beings who experience pain, love and deserve a life beyond being used for consumption.  

However, I have autism, and I am an extremely picky eater.

When I say picky, I am not just talking about textures, I haven’t eaten a piece of fruit since I was in elementary school and most vegetables make me gag. I also can barley stomach salads and you couldn’t even pay me to eat that kind of stuff. There are very few textures I Can actually tolerate and a lot of vegan recipes admittedly kind of look like dogshit. 

I would have no problem actually cutting out stuff like meat (I hate the taste of milk and yogurt so I don’t eat those, but I do eat a lot of cheese). But finding healthy substitutes to those things is the difficult part—especially since I live in an area that doesn’t really have many supermarkets, yet alone vegan options. 

Seafood would also be a big problem for me since it’s one of the only proteins/sources of B-12 I get and I am going to be honest, I really like seafood. I also really love cheese and seafood and cheese are stuff that even from some vegans, say that the vegan replacements don’t taste good. 

One saving factor would be the fact I am obsessed with mushrooms and I could easily cut out all meat and replace it with mushrooms, but mushrooms alone doesn’t make up a balanced diet. 

This has just been circling my mind a lot and I don’t know if anyone is going to notice this, but yeah.",True,False,False,vegan,t5_2qhpm,585127,public,self,Considering going vegan...but I am neurodivergent,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/mixd18/considering_going_veganbut_i_am_neurodivergent/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,Advice,3ae8cb6e-685e-11e9-90e6-0eb95b81be6a,Advice,,,,,,,,,

I'm a 16(F) and I'm very concerned about my health at the moment. I went vegan about a year ago (only for the animals), and ever since then, my food choices have just plummeted. That's not to say a non-vegan diet is inherently good for you, but when I wasn't vegan, I was given much more support, and thus, much more options. My family does support me somewhat (they are not vegan), and they buy me things like tofu, vegan snacks, and even got me a whole bunch of vegan stuff for my b-day. However, because they're not vegan (and because the world is generally non-vegan), I never really properly learned how to make anything that doesn't contain rotting corpses in it. I don't know how to cook a lot of vegan dishes, and I struggle to find recipes online that can cater to my living situation right now (my parents only buying vegan products they can afford). I also want to try and abstain from plant-based ""meats"" and other products like that; I want to cook real vegan meals, because I just think they taste better. My go-tos in the past have usually been things like white/brown rice with different veggies, depending on what we have. But in contrast, I eat a ton of processed junk throughout the day, like chips, soda, candy. And by the time dinner comes around, it's usually another gigantic load of sodium or processed, easy-to-make meals. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

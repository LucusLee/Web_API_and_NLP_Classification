I suppose this seems like an unnecessary rant, we’ve probably all felt this way, but I cannot understand how this is happening. How can we do this? I care about the environmental aspect of all of this as well, but even if none of that was a factor, this pain and torture is abominable. If anyone has any belief that we should do good in the world and not cause harm, then you cannot support this industry. The disrespect we’re showing these creatures is like something out of Saw. It should not exist. 

I’m continually gagging and I’m only ten minutes in. I know all we can do is stop eating it ourselves, and using products, but that doesn’t feel like enough. I’ve always suffered from severe depression, but knowing what is happening in this very moment, and has happened for years, and will seemingly continue is making me sick, and hopeless. 

My family and friends don’t want to see, nobody wants to see this. Anyone with any power and sway in this world doesn’t seem to want to help either. Of course there are exceptions, but overall we’re just fucked. I’ll be okay I’m sure, this just feels like the only place anyone will understand. 

I feel hate toward the workers, so cruel and callous about it all. They can’t even treat the animals with dignity, they actively make their lives even more of a Hell. These beautiful beings only want food and freedom, and would, as individuals show us all the love our pets do. As I write this my cat is climbing in my lap to check on me, because he cares about me. I know if any piglet of calf were rescued they could bond just as much with me. 

I just wish I could Thanos style snap them out of existence. Maybe that’s cruel too, but it seems better than what they have. Ideally I wish they could live free lives, but what would that mean to a genetically altered beast that no longer has any part in the natural ecosystems. We alter the world with no regard for what could happen. And we deserve whatever we get because of it. It’s breaking my heart that we’re taking everything else with us. 

This rock will keep spinning when we’re gone, and new life will rise, but how awful that everything beautiful here may be lost before we make our exit.

And ever since that conversation, every SINGLE day, and every fucking time he gets the chance to, he forces me to eat meet.
Literally whenever we go out to a restaurant or something he orders a very meat based meal for me, and  forces me to eat it??
I tried telling him that i was ""convinced"" of what he told me last time about this subject, and I've expressed to him multiple times how uncomfortable this makes me feel.

First time posting here.

I’m several months into the veggie lifestyle. I’m personally loving it. I love the food I make. I feel great physically and emotionally. I’m healthier than ever. I no longer feel guilty for contributing to the mistreatment of animals or damage done to the environment. 

But... I’m feeling defeated af. I just want to share all the stuff I’ve learned over my, albeit recent, journey with others because I’m excited about it. I’ve read so many science-based books and studies, as well as watched a lot of documentaries about the harms of eating animals and animal byproducts. 

Unfortunately, people are so biased to eating meat and just blatantly misinformed about the evidence behind the harm of it all. I find myself trying to be as objective and science-based as possible, but I wind up getting into debates I didn’t want to get in. I don’t want to be *that person* who comes across as the condescending vegan forcing their beliefs down someone else’s throats... because apparently that’s just automatically how you’re perceived as soon as someone learns you don’t eat meat and care about the planet. Insert eye roll here. I just want to be an advocate without being too much. 

I just want to help other people. I wish I had known about all the health benefits to eating plant-based much sooner. I wish I had known the full extent about how even just drinking milk and supporting the dairy industry results in cows suffering. I was just blissfully ignorant I guess. But I really wish I had made the switch years ago. 

Anyways, any advice on how to not feel so sad and defeated about people just not caring about going plant-based?

This stance has expanded over the years to include the obvious environmental argument for a reduced land-use impact on the world and reduction of the high greenhouse gas emissions that result from raising the billions of animals we slaughter every year. 

I haven't however yet went so far as to cut out animal products, such as eggs and dairy, especially as I can buy some of them from a farm near my house that has a  lovely sense of animal welfare. But after speaking with my roommates more about reducing our individual impacts, I decided to look closely at what the emissions are of the foods that I commonly eat, and, wow:

It turns out cheese, chocolate, and coffee account for the bulk of what's left of my food-related greenhouse emissions. The rough ball park is that my consumption of just those three products leads to about 500kg of CO2 equivalents being emitted per year. Equal to roughly what I emit from power consumption or traveling by bus/subway/rail. The rest of my food consumption combined probably only equals 200-300kg of CO2, with a lot of that being from olive oil. 

(Using the data found here:)
https://ourworldindata.org/food-choice-vs-eating-local

It's a tough sell for me, as I like practically every cheese and would put it on every meal in some way. Chocolate isn't a huge deal for me, and I've replaced coffee with some other coffee-like products made from wheat that don't have caffeine but do the trick for me. 

Probably I will take an approach to reduce my consumption, allowing the odd cheesy treat instead of having it be a very regular part of my purchases/diet.

associées :

 Trouble de l'évacuation recta - sigmoidienne ( qui est à proprement parler une fausse constipation ) 

- par insuffisance de volume du bol lécal ; par insuffisance d'hydratation : par mauvaises habitudes diététiques ( abus de nouilles , riz , sucre , cho colat : pauvreté du régime en aliments riches en cellulose : légumes , fruits ) .

- vieillard , sujets déprimés , hypotonie neuro - végétative : - constipation régulière , selles déshydratées , diminuées de volume . 

3. Constipation spasmodique : 

– femmes jeunes , hypertonie neuro - végétative ; - constipation intermittente , douloureuse ; - ballonnement abdominal . Il faut rattacher à la constipation : - les selles non homogènes , scybales et liquide , de l'hypersécrétion colique : la fausse diarrhée homogène que l'analyse chimique caractérise comme une surdigestion .

So based on that of course I don't want to stop, I don't think anyone does, but if I continued using medicine then I'd be contributing to animal exploitation which defeats the purpose of becoming vegan to begin with. 

Ultimately, human and animal life are equal, neither one is morally superior to the other. So if I get sick, then the ethical thing to do would be to let myself get sicker and die. Why should I sacrifice an animal's life to save my own? But I don't want to get sick and die, so I'm stuck.

There was a study where people bribed $1 or $20 lied to say a boring activity was interesting. The people paid $1 changed their attitude so that they actually believed the activity wasn't too boring. This study shows cognitive dissonance in action. However, the people bribed $20 didn't change their attitude. This was because they could say that it was the money that made them lie, not themselves.

We all know omnis experience cognitive dissonance which leads to my question:

Let's say taste is the bribe to abuse and kill animals. If omnis say they love meat, then why do they have cognitive dissonance when the people bribed the higher amount didn't?

The taste they experience is actually not significant, it is only exaggerated by their cognitive dissonance to justify their actions.

Would this knowledge help with outreach, no.

i was a huge meat eater. i loved cheese and eggs. there wasnt a day, heck even a meal, without animal products. then one day, 4/8/2014, i watched earthlings and turned my nutrition upside down: fully plant based. i researched cruelty free products and avoided zoos etc. i have never felt as genuine and real and authentic.

i dont know what happened in 2018 but i completely lost myself. 

i started hurting myself again. i was completely burnt out. i started binge eating and purging. i ate until i was sick and then spent 3 to 4 hours at the gym. i compensated the pressure and anxiety with food and exercise. then i figured, i would feel sick faster if i ate the lifeless bodies of innocent animals and if i drank baby cow growth juice and if i scrambled some chicken period. so i started consuming animal products again...to hurt myself. every time i put something on my plate, i thought about the horrific process needed for this to land on my plate. it made me feel sick to my stomach. this was my new way of self harm. when my own blood wasnt enough, i needed my conscience to weigh heavily on me for having the blood of innocent animals on my hands.

after about two years of this mental torture to myself, i realized that i wasnt fine. i wasnt „just coping with thing differently“. i was hurting myself, either with the knife on my skin or with the fork on my plate. i mustered all my courage and finally admitted i needed help. i started therapy. 

a few therapists, and meds, and diagnoses, later, here i am. 

i found myself again. 

i am immeasurably sorry. i have betrayed my beloved fellow earthlings. i wouldnt say i have any regrets in my life...except for this betrayal.

anyway, then i got them benovo, they don't like it at all, and I can't blame them, just by smelling it it doesn't smell nice, very bland and unappetizing, they actually got thin on it, and would barely eat it, ate mostly homemade food.

Then got them vdog nuggets dog food, they love it so much, probably the most out of all the dog foods, they did love vegan natural balance more than the meat based dog food i used to feed them but i think they love vdog even more than that.

The problem is that after switching them to it my dogs became itchy, one of my dogs, the male in particular has become super itchy and keeps biting himself.

the bag is almost over, in alittle over a month i think, usually the dog food lasts them a lot longer tho.

Anyway my dad already got another bag of it, i think i should probably have it returned, i wish i could find natural balance vegan dog food.

any experience with this?

I would like to keep my dogs on vdog but i would need to find a solution to the biting problem, is it some form of allergic reaction to one of the ingredients?

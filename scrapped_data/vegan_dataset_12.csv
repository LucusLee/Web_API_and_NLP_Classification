These toxins are primarily caused by making fertilizer, and while I enjoy veggies and grains myself, keep in mind:

1) In the United States, just 27 percent of crop calories are consumed directly — wheat, say, or fruits and vegetables grown in California. By contrast, more than 67 percent of crops — particularly all the soy grown in the Midwest — goes to animal feed.

2) Eliminating animal agriculture would result in a 75% reduction in overall farmland use and still feed the world.

In conclusion, feeding animals, to in turn eat them, is a woefully inefficient use of our limited resources. We could massively reduce farmland by eating the crops directly ... which would in turn massively reduce the need for fertilizer ... and then we might not have to worry that our houses might get crushed by tidal wave of toxic waste! Wouldn't that be nice!

I manage to tune it out pretty well, so the annoyance of the noise is not really a concern. What I'm much more concerned about is the wellbeing of the fuckin dog, for a few reasons:

1. Dogs don't just bark all day for no reason, right? Sure some are more rowdy and hyper than others, but it lives on the third floor of a building, what does it have to bark at that it can see out the windows?
2. The dog sounds choked. The barking doesn't sound playful; it sounds more like gasping and yelping, and sometimes it quiets down for a minute and instead I hear low, slight howling, before the barking picks up again.
3. The sound always comes from the same part of the apartment. I hear it much more clearly in one room than I do elsewhere in my apartment. 
4. The people have lived here for at least 5 months, and I have NEVER ONCE seen them walking a dog outside or even taking a dog out to go to the bathroom real quick. My roommate, who hasn't been working for the last couple months and has been here a lot, has also never seen or heard any sign of the dog going outside.

I wouldn't have thought much of it until I realized those last two points. Would it seriously be possible that they're keeping the dog in one of the rooms and not taking it outside? If so, how the fuck do they deal with the dog going to the bathroom? I have no sense of smell, but my roommate said she doesn't smell anything suspicious. I just don't wanna take any rash actions. I knocked on the door upstairs and the guy answered but he spoke almost no English, I think he thought I was just telling him to keep his dog down. I don't wanna call animal control because I'm worried they will just euthanize the dog or some shit, seems like most organizations are always so quick to do that. I think my best bet is to ask the property manager if they could just go in there and take a look at things, but that might also result in animal control coming. Are there types of animal control places that I could contact that would know how to better deal with this situation? Or should I just assume the dog is okay and just leave them be?

The app is still relatively new and we only launched Jan / Feb this year so we don't have many users right now, but are growing slowly each day.

Looking at peoples feedback regarding other vegan dating apps having bad interfaces, poor design and bugs we have tried to take this onboard when creating TofuTogether. 

The app is mostly free with a few limits on swiping (5 yes swipes a day, we also think this helps reduce spamming right/ yes swipes) and feed posts (3 a day). We wish it could be entirely free but then we would have to secretly sell your data 👀 or put adverts in to sustain the costs. People you have matched with are entirely free to message.

**If you have any feedback on the app, bugs or features you'd like to see added, please let us know as we'd really love to hear.**

I can understand the benefits of vegetarianism and could one day take that route, but currently believe veganism is actually ethically counterproductive. Thats a discussion we can save for another time.  

Anyway, I was having a debate with my significant other the other day about hunting. This isn't pertaining to illegal hunting, poaching or any form of hunting that actively kills an already diminishing species. This is more in regards to sport hunting and other legal forms of hunting. My significant other is vegan. 

So, anyway, I personally feel as though hunting isn't as bad as it is made out to be. My SO felt quite the opposite. She basically stated that killing any animal under any circumstance is one of the worst things you can do. Although I do agree to some extent, I do believe that there is a lot more to take into consideration than just the death of the animal. In particular, I made the argument that sport hunting and the industry actually does bring about a lot more good than people realize. A lot of hunters pay for permits, and in some cases of big game pay thousands of dollars to kill one animal. This money is often put back into the land used for preservation purposes as well as funding security for those animals which are often poached. The documentary Trophy discusses this particularly well in my opinion. If if were not for this money put back into preservation, I believe that a lot of forgotten land would be taken advantage of by big business for development purposes. Additionally, in the case of invasive species, it can actually be beneficial to hunt those animals as to preserve the indigenous populations. My SO, however, did not feel the same way at all. She said that no matter the circumstance hunting is ethically wrong and should be looked down upon.

At this point, I decided to bring up the famous ethical trolley problem. Instead of giving her the situation using people, I instead used deers. Would it be okay to kill 1 deer if you could save 100 deers from death. She was very turnt off by this question. She first tried to say that she would not make that decision but would rather die before making it at first, until I pressed her. She eventually landed on not killing the 1 deer because she could never be the person that determines the death of an animal. I thought this was a bit of a cop out and explained to her that one would then assume that she is basically letting the other 100 deer die. She argued that it was a ridiculous scenario and not one that can be related to ethics at all. That i should not have brought up that situation when discussing animal activism. Oh well.

Anyway, my point was to say that hunting, legally, may result in the death of a few animals but at the same time it could bring money to help preserve many more animals and environments. Ultimately then, if done correctly, hunting wouldn't be so bad and instead could have positive benefits. Especially since it is already so hard to fund land preservation and hire lawyers willing to fight against big businesses for this purpose. Anyway that was a brief rundown of the discussion at hand. I know she values the opinion of this community so I am posing the question to you guys. What are your takes on hunting?

However, I have only been looking at calories, never at nutrients, but today I realised I am not getting enough of some things, and too much of others (according to MFP).

MYP says I'm meant to get 70g protein, 47g fat, 175 carbs, and 53g sugar. Another website said I'm meant to have like 250 carbs, whereas another said I'm meant to have 50-100 carbs if trying to lose weight which I am. Generally most websites seem to say about 50g of fat and 50g of protein. And then some websites say 30g of sugar and others have said 90g! 

I don't know what to do and I'm freaking out. I've also been trying to plan food for a day and have been trying to keep my nutrients around 150g carbs, 50g protein, 50g fat, and 30g sugar and it feels impossible to get it perfect without one of the nutrients being too much of too little!

I was wondering about something...
I have been vegan for about 3 years and vegetarian for about 10. I grew up in Blowmaha Nebraska and moved to PHX about 3 years ago,  right about the time I became vegan. It was difficult but not impossible to not eat meat in the middle of beef country, but I'd say pretty much impossible to avoid things like butter and eggs in sauces and such. Much easier here in the Land of Produce :D
Anyways, I'm 6'10"" 360 lbs and I've never really been into fitness or exercise. I hate to use a cliche, but I truly don't have the time for it. I recently went to a gym with a friend of mine and I figured what the hell, I'll give it a go. Im not really in the best of shape, especially as a vegan. I feel great and my bloodwork etc are all good, but I can't seem to lose any weight. Too many grains and beans, which my system doesn't do so hot with. 
At the gym my friend had me lift weights with him. He said we could do reps to figure out the max rather than overdoing it and likely causing an injury. I maxed benchpress at 375, curled 110, and legs 2000.
If I wanted to really get into this, is vegan food going to be enough calories? Like I said beans and grains don't do very well for my guts, and f&amp;v have hardly any calories. That leaves mushrooms and nuts and avocados...
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

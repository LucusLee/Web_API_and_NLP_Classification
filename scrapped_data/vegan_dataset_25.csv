I understand the type of white vegan that people are describing when they have a negative feeling to the term - I am probably more plant based than vegan because I don’t think I am 100% vigilant about every thing I use in my life, so this is more out of curiosity of people’s thoughts than personal reasons anyway.

1. How expensive it is when lacking the time or motivation to cook.
2. How easy it is to not get sufficient nutrients/calories.

The last year and a half I’ve been struggling with the calories factor. I’ve tried eating more peanut butter, avocados, olive oil, etc., but maybe I’m just crazy and can’t eat like that every day, multiple times a day

At this point, I feel like I’m too depressed to be motivated for basic upkeep of myself. As a result, my periods became so irregular, and I’ve lost so much weight and cannot gain it back. I’m almost borderline underweight. 

So I resorted to ordering food delivery literally everyday (I don’t have a car to do takeout and the spots I can eat at are not within walking distance), with a mixture of groceries because I don’t want to have strictly delivery. I’ve spent at least $3k in those 5 months on this, maybe even $4k. So I’ve been getting more calories in and my period went back to being regular. 28 days on the dot for 5 months straight. But my pockets are shot when I’m supposed to be saving to move out.

So the past few of months, I’ve been trying to force myself to cook and eat, and this is quick or easy kind of foods (throw it in an oven, microwave, etc.) but I don’t think anyone understands how hard these basic tasks are for me, especially if I need to cook more nutrient-dense, calorie-heavy foods. Plus, I can’t stomach even half as much home-cooked meals than I can with delivery. I get full fast, and half the time I lose my appetite altogether. 

People keep telling me to just start meal prep, toss food in a slow cooker, eat this, eat that, do X, Y, and Z. It’s not about what to do, it’s the effort. Now I feel so much pressure and like a failure because these basic tasks are no-brainers for the average person. But it’s a difficult chore for me.

Still, 3 months later trying to eat from home, and I thought I was doing good with it, but I’m still not eating enough calories. Some days I eat 2-3 times a day and only manage &lt;1k calories, some days I only eat once or not at all.

And now my period is late. Last month, my period came early at 26 days. I knew what this meant, and I’ve been trying to eat more, but now I’m 1 day late and still don’t feel the signs that it’s coming yet. This is what my periods have looked like in the past year: https://imgur.com/a/Mg9lKMV

Eating was a lot easier before I was vegan, because all the processed and fast food was cheap if need be while providing all the calories. Then I’d just take multivitamins. 

But being vegan is proving extremely difficult for me, and I’m hating myself so much for it. I went vegan for ethical reasons, so I simply cannot stomach the idea of eating animals, and I’m still struggling with eating enough.

Please read the rest of this post with this in mind, and approach it with open-mindedness and self-awareness.

&amp;#x200B;

During the past decade, veganism has become a viable, mainstream alternative to the traditional western omnivore diet, it is now more accepted than ever and its benefits are backed up by science. However, it still isn’t something completely normalized especially in developing countries and there’s still a lot of work left to do for environmental and vegan activists.

Now, in my opinion, the reason why this uphill battle is so much more difficult than it should be is that mainstream vegan activism is so overly aggressive that it turns potential “allies” into disassociated, indifferent assets. PETA, for better or worse, is the face of the vegan brand around the world, and its marketing approach is horrendously hostile, actively insulting people. Listen to this, You will NEVER change someone’s mind when you start a conversation with “You are wrong, stupid, and a bad person; here’s why…” call it immaturity, overly sensitivity, whatever, that fact remains true. That’s the same reason why climate change awareness is so difficult to get across people’s minds, very few people have the ability to be that introspective and take that amount of personal responsibility, to sacrifice something without a tangible reward for them.

You are right. You have the truth and the moral high ground on your side. Use that responsibly, use it as a tool and not as a weapon. Instead of sharing belligerent memes to “fight back” the status quo or the obnoxious, intolerant people that you have come across with; be patient instead. Create a platform and a space where people can feel safe talking to you and asking questions and seeking help. Most of us have been conditioned and indoctrinated to eat meat and dairy products. Stop acting like it's not hard, stop acting like it isn’t a hardship for some to leave something that brings them so much joy. I’ve lived in several countries throughout my life and you have no idea how out of touch you can sound when you nag people who are trying to quit meat gradually instead of instantly. In third world countries, vegan alternatives are much more difficult to acquire and the building blocks for a well-balanced, tasty diet without the help of animal-based products are simply not there sometimes. People find comfort in their favorite food and to take that away from them is going to be challenging but if you want to gain more followers in your movement I implore you to leave the self-righteousness behind and learn to be resilient. Ignorant people will give you shit, so what? Prove that you are in this for the right reasons and talk to them, teach them and be patient. It takes time for people to come around and find within themselves the answers and strength to take this kind of life-changing decision.

All of you together need to change your radical approach. I know that animals are being tortured to an incomprehensible level, but if you want to win this generational war, you need to do it with kindness and understanding. You may think it's dumb and that people should just “grow up” and do the right thing. Well, guess what: that’s not gonna happen by guilting them. That’s why there are so many visceral attacks against you, people are in denial and have protective mechanisms, you shall strip those down one at a time. You may be thinking “Changing people is not my responsibility” and you are right, this post is written for those of you who already had taken on that responsibility, who have already talked to your friends and family, and are active on social media, and donate, and volunteer your time.

Slow and steady wins the race. You are on the right side of history and if you know history you understand that these things are won by fighting methodically, not emotionally.

There's a lot of benefits too"" sounds a lot better than ""meat-eaters are terrible people and are going to hell. become vegan or else you're shitty"" ofc the latter is really just an example and i don't think people say those exact words, but there are vegans who try to shove that belief down other people's throats.

More than 63 billion terrestrial animals and, by very conservative  estimates, more than 103 billion aquatic animals are killed for human  consumption every year. The amount of death and suffering is simply staggering.  
&gt;  
&gt;If any other species caused as much damage as humans do, we would think it wrong to breed new members of that species  
&gt;  
&gt;All this is caused by the human appetite for animal flesh and  products, an appetite shared by the great majority of humans. Using very  conservative estimates, every human (who is not a vegetarian or vegan)  is, on average, responsible for the death of 27 animals per year, or  1,690 animals over the course of a lifetime.  
&gt;  
&gt;Perhaps you think that by raising vegan children you can evade the  reach of the misanthropic argument. However, each new child, even if a  vegan, is very likely to contribute to environmental damage, one of the  means whereby humans harm humans and other animals. In the developed  world, the per-capita contribution to environmental degradation is  considerable. It is much lower in the developing world, but the much  higher birthrate there offsets the per-capita saving.  
&gt;  
&gt;If any other species caused as much damage as humans do, we would  think it wrong to breed new members of that species. The breeding of  humans should be held to the same standard.

This feeling has caused me to buy 5 pigs in hopes of giving them a life outside of the slaughterhouse. My first 4 pigs i had to give to animal sanctuaries because I didn't have a place where the landlord was OK with them.

My mum often scolds me that I was wrong and irresponsible. I don't think she understands how deeply I love animals despite becoming a vegetarian after I became one aged 12. I honestly do not regret getting my first 4 pigs because the fact is they would be dead right now had I not bought them.

Right now I have my 5th pig. I will admit to you I didn't have permission from my landlord to get a pig but I was hoping my flatmates wouldn't mind. However one minded. The pig happened to run off at which point it was taken to a stable pending the ear tag which I then ordered. I have now collected the pig and taken it to pet boarding pending moving into a rented flat with a garden in a few days.

I am being totally honest here when I say i didn't look for housing until after having the pig, largely because I doubted any landlord would say yes but I couldn't take it any more thinking of innocent creatures dying.

I did spend some time with the pig for 4 days before it was at the stable or pet boarding. Another thing that made me worry I'm a bad person is that I took the pig on a walk and it only walked with me half the time and it plopped down and I dragged it a bit because it was too heavy to hold. It's 3 months old but it weights almost 35 kg. I then noticed part of its skin was bleeding and I felt really bad like wow this is my fault.

I also find myself flying by the seat of my pants because I find most online info too confusing to understand. However I have requested contact info for the farm from where the stable orders pig feed so I should be able to feed it properly going forward. This morning I fed it a whole easter cake. I felt a bit ashamed though that I googled can pigs eat dog food before taking my pig to the pet boarding.

I guess all this has made me feel like, I do have good intentions but I sometimes think I'm some sort of idiot because of all the trouble I get into with my piglets and I wonder if something is wrong with my brain.

I will say my pig liked me very much. It loved sitting on my lap and lying next to me. It loved spooning as well and often fell asleep next to me.

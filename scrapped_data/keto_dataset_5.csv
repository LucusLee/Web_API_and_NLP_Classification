However, I want to know what other long term keto dieters do in sustaining mode, and maybe give people starting on the diet encouragement to continue. Or is it actually difficult to sustain for the majority?

My own experience on sustaining:

After 2 years of strict keto and reaching my goal body fat and weight, I relaxed the protocol and would treat myself to ice cream (w/real sugar) almost daily (2 scoops &lt;20 g carbs) and do not restrict carbs on the weekends (however, carbs feel so filling now that I can only eat once a day on the weekends).

Blood tests show I’m still always in ketosis. Any weight gained from a weekend of carbs disappears by mid-week and I haven’t had dreams about eating carbs for the last 2 years. In fact, carbs make me feel so full so quickly that I tend to avoid any old carbs and only eat carbs I really love like ice cream and French fries.

Examples: The far eastern civilizations were built on rice, the Roman empire and the civilizations in the fertile crescent were built on wheat and barley; The mesoamerican civilizations, that is the Aztecs and the Mayans etc., were built on corn, and potatoes. It was grains, and the farmers that grew them, that allowed the civilizations to produce enough calories that they didn't have to be hunter-gatherers all the time, and could therefore build on their arts and sciences.

Those of you with more keto experience probably already know what happened.

They ran tests and everything looked normal. I did however have potassium on the low end of normal as well as sodium and magnesium were in the lower end. I did some more research (which I should have done in the first place), and it became very clear that I was not consuming enough electrolytes.

Their urgent care is absolutely horrible, though, so I didn’t go.

I’ve been on keto for almost a month and a half. Since changing my eating habits, most of my stomach upsets have gone away, which has been awesome! However, today something awful happened. I was sitting at a coffee shop and I had diarrhea. No big deal, I just went to the bathroom and did my thing. When I walked out of the bathroom and sat back down, I experienced what I can only compare to labor pains. I’ve never given birth, but in my mind this is what I think labor pains would feel like. I had extremely painful cramps in somewhat of a V shape on my belly and my uterus area hurt so insanely bad. I damn near considered calling an ambulance because I didn’t know how the hell I was gonna make it out of there. I sat down for a few minutes and just calmed myself down. I gathered my belongings and left. I walked to my car and drove home with tears streaming down my face. My belly felt so tight and my cramps down there were something fierce. I got home and getting inside sucked too. I live on the second floor, I don’t even know how I made it up the stairs. 

My question is essentially this: could I be eating/drinking something that is causing this? I generally stay below 30 carbs a day. However, I have been drinking a lot more coffee flavored with a Vanilla-Splenda syrup. I also had two vodka on the rocks yesterday (I don’t drink often) AND I will admit, I ate a ton of spicy pork rinds yesterday. This pain was absolutely horrific, I wouldn’t wish it on anyone.

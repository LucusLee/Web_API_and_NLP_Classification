I am quite young for my age, but I assure you I am well over my years mentally. I care deeply for the environment, animals, and my body. I went vegetarian (which I know is not the same) about a year ago, but unfortunately had to go back to eating chicken (please don’t hate me, my mom and doctor both said I needed more protein) because I got very ill due to being malnourished. I wasn’t getting enough protein in my diet, despite eating lentils, beans, nuts, and other things. I even opted for some vegan patties, nuggets, pizza, and other things while being vegetarian. I absolutely HATED eating any thing with a beating heart. I still do. I feel guilty every time I eat chicken or any other meat. 

My mom supports me through everything, so if I told her I wanted to go vegan, she wouldn’t mind, I would just have to do intense research to make sure I don’t become malnourished again. The only issue is, my entire family eats meat... so whenever I have dieted, exercised, or even when I was vegetarian, I was the only one in my household. It was hard at first, but I just stopped craving meat and such. It is hard to do’s nothing remotely different when you’re in a house with people who don’t care about the meat industry and stuff. I guess they just aren’t as educated as I am. 

I really have a hard time finding foods I like. Or foods that are good. Or being full enough. I don’t want that to happen, because we all know that being hungry sucks.

That focus be shift to singling out the methods for which meat is harvested? No I don't mean in a ""-and this is why you shouldn't eat meat"" way, because that doesn't address the problem directly.
A person could go vegan today and still millions of animals will be killed tomorrow because everyone else isn't vegan. So what I mean is, attacking their methods directly.

Vegans could address their methods with the purpose of forcing a change to alternative methods that meet a supposed humane criteria. A method that is used to, theortically bring suffering and torture to zero if not the bare minimum. For starters its known that the methods they currently use are optimized for mass production, not for the regard of animals at all..
If these methods are approached with the sense of bettering the production instead of shutting it down (which is also the ultimate goal.) .. This will impact production value. As most ways to mass kill for demand won't meet the bare minimum of suffering criteria that has been set.

This should get support as most people don't support the suffering and torture of animals. So if a petition is started perhaps signatures would be bountiful if that reason is expressed for changes in regulation.

If it goes as expected, the prices of meat will rise due to new regulations of more attentive killings of animals. More attentive meaning more time consuming, less is being able to be produced.. The only option to compensate is hire more people, which eats away at the businesses money. The only way to compensate THAT is higher the prices. 
With prices going up, less people will buy or be able to buy, which would effectively put a dent in production value would it not?

This also ties into the forceful impregnation of animals. If you could prove in court that it is no different from the rape of a real animals by human hands (which is already illegal). You could forcibly change regulation to only have breedings done naturally. 
If the animals are being stressed out constantly and tortured, the last thing they are going to want to do is breed. That would indefinitely slow down production and make meat a rarity. Something not a lot of people could buy.

I am new to veganism (made it my new year's resolution to be vegan by the end of the year, and I've made great peogress) but was a vegetarian for a lot of my teen years, whenever it was possible. My adoptive family, despite frequently using meat substitutes in their food, would ridicule me in public, with their friends, and at restauraunts for not wanting to eat meat. You probably have heard it, joking about forcing you to eat meat, tricking you, etc. I have dealt with previous mistreatment (hence why I was adopted) and basically just... Gave up until I ran off as an adult.

This, and the way veganism is so often openly mocked by others online, makes me really nervous to be in this situation if I ever mention my diet. I don't want to react poorly to someone and just be another person reinforcing the idea that veganism isnt something to take seriously. You're all probably much better equipped to handle these situations, please tell me what your strategies are. I want to be openly vegan someday once I'm actually 100% there. I want to be an advocate. But I know this might be a big hurdle for me.

Last night I was laying in bed and couldn’t fall asleep for a while... I’m reading vegan news and saw about Joaquin Phoenix and Rooney Mara helping with donating vegan meals to the LGBTQ+ community (shared last night if you’re interested!) and felt super moved. I just finally went fully vegan last month after being vegetarian since the end of 2018. I want to do more. I’m sharing content on my social media accounts, I’m following vegan accounts to stay informed, I’m even finally creating my health blog and will be offering a free e-book with most all info I can dig up on going vegan, including vegan resources, pages, groups, recipes, and brands. I feel damn good about this! 

Anyway, as I was thinking about all of this, I realized, I live in South Carolina, a huge region for fishing, barbecue, etc. and know one person who is a vegetarian. I’m wondering if there’s like, a site where I can find vegans near me? I would just love that fellowship because I feel so alone in my area. I’m also not working, 27F, and live basically off an old golf course surrounded by very rich people with nothing but time, so that also makes me feel more alone in this effort. 

Any tips are appreciated! I’m down for virtual friendships, but being able to say, be part of an activist group would feel freaking great, and I don’t know if there are any near me. 

That’s all! Thank you all and have a great day!",True,False,False,vegan,t5_2qhpm,584908,public,self,Groups Near Me,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/miksdb/groups_near_me/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was a recent episode on what they referred to as Honor Culture. 

Honor Culture is the concept that you have to defend your position and reputation above all, with dire social consequences if you don’t. It traps you in a cycle of violence and being unable to admit when you are wrong. 

Examples ranged from the loss of the World Cup by France after the Italian star player called the French captain’s sister a whore (and he head butted him and was ejected from the game) to the examples in movies and media, so on. 

Everything I was hearing tracked with meat eaters being part of this example of honor culture. Inability to admit it’s wrong. Reacting violently with actions or words when confronted by the unpleasant truths. 

I highly advise giving it a listen and then responding with your thoughts.

Like most people I've eaten meat all my life. I met a good friend online who's been vegan for about 5 years now. He's helped me find alternatives and been very welcoming and accepting that changing your entire lifestyle is difficult much like changing your religion isn't an overnight rewire of your brain. I know veganism is more than a diet, its an ethical at its core. Ive been looking for resources and groups to help me keep my mind on the goal of being a better person and helping build a better world for animals and humans alike. 

I still have thoughts of eating meat and can't seem to tear the wall down between the animals I want to save and the cravings I still get. Ive changes almost all of my diet apart from eggs and fish which are the last 2 mental walls I have to overcome but I still crave meat.

 This brings me to the question I posed in the title. Why does this subreddit seem so hostile? From the posts I've read I expect to be called names and down voted for my curiosity. Not everyone is the same, in the same place mentally, or wired the same way.

Obligatory ""I'm not a vegan"", but I've been enjoying more tofu and plant-based meals as of late. I still don't mind eating meat, but I prefer not to when I have the option.

I did have a genuine question though. If you raised your own chickens just for fun, would you eat their eggs? I ask because I used to raise poultry (not for meat purposes), and they were always producing eggs. The hens, if no rooster was present, would rarely be broody (they were rarely broody even with a rooster), so the eggs were just left in the nest. I understand going vegan out of concern for animals and their treatment, but in this case, no animal is being harmed and it keeps animals like snakes and raccoons out of your coop because they know there are no eggs. Is there anything that makes eating these eggs unethical in your eyes, or would it be okay because you own these chickens and they're free-range - not being forced to live in terrible conditions to maximize production?

I'm just genuinely curious! I choose vegan options at the store when possible (if I have the budget for it since it can get expensive), but I spent the majority of my childhood raising chickens and just couldn't get this question out of my head. **I do understand not wanting to buy eggs in the store because of the horrible conditions they keep chickens in.** 

(I would also just genuinely like to know what made you choose to go vegan, questions aside! Did you start out vegetarian first, or did you hop right in?)

I hope none of my questions offend and thank you for taking the time to read this! I just want to become more educated on the topic and understand it from a different perspective.

*Processing video b86onllzv6q61...*

Hi Everyone,

**This is about her survival and how you can help**

Vivek here, the person in the video is my sister, Kriti. I will try to make this as short as possible, but at the same time, request you to read this entirely.

**Since past 10 years, my sister has been fighting BLOOD CANCER - Chronic Myeloid Leukemia,** it is very dangerous disease which requires weekly blood test, chemo meds and hospital visit, she has been visiting hospital every month for past 10 years.

Now, her disease has progressed to **Advance Stage** as she developed drug-resistance towards all chemo medicine available.  
**She has suffered enough pain, needles and dreading hospital visit in past 10 years, please understand the pain and come forward.**

Only solution for us is if she finds a ""**TISSUE-TYPE"" matching BLOOD STEM CELL DONOR, who can donate few amount of stem cells (just like donating PLATELETs) which help** cure her Blood Cancer.  
**There is no ORGAN OR SURGERY INVOLVED.**

**ISSUE IS:**

* Finding a match is extremely rare. **1 in MILLION** as very few people are registered in stem cell registry.
* People don't realize that everyone ""tissue type"" is **unique and rare,** and only 2-3 people matches with one another in the entire world, so unless they register we can't find match. So by not registering they are not including their tissue type to be matched against her or someone who's cancer you can cure.
* We have tried everything in **past 9 months to get a match, still unable to find one, but her cancer cells are growing rapidly.**

**IMPORTANT: How you can help?**

* You can take a **free swab test, which are delivered to your home to see** if your **""TISSUE TYPE""** is matching with her. **ANY BLOOD GROUP can be a match. (Age: 18-50).**

* **You can help us by asking your family, friends and co-workers to register, share them this link it will have all information.**

**What are STEM CELLs? How donation happens?**

Stem Cell are basic cells, which gets converted into all the other cells of your body like liver cells, tissue cells, blood cells. Stem Cell Donation is similar to Platelet Donation, and **you keep making stem cells in your body, no harm to you, but is a lifesaving treatment for my sister.**

I feel guilty wearing them, and feel some shameful obligation to hide them (to ""prove"" I'm vegan now), but in my logical mind I feel like no longer using those things would be wasteful and the thought of getting rid of them somehow makes me feel worse. I feel like I have a responsibility to get as much use out of them as I can to prevent waste of the animals products I already have, that are decades old. It may be against the vegan moral philosophy to continue to utilize these things, but I'm personally significantly less concerned with something as abstract, emotional and personal as moral consistency as I am with reducing actual harm and improving conditions for everyone.

Is there is a good philosophical justification for ceasing use of old leather stuff? I've reflected on why I feel guilt anyway and I've decided that it's all just emotional guilt with its only basis in some ""code"", and no basis on my actual impact on the world on the result.

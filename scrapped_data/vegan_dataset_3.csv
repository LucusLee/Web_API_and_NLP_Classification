I apologize, but I'm going to rant for a minute. I had someone tell me recently ""If you were a ***real*** environmentalist, you wouldn't invest in crypto"". I mean, yes, crypto definitely has an environmental impact. But so does posting on Reddit, using Facebook, streaming videos and/or music on Netflix/Spotify. If our society ran on renewables, this wouldn't even be an argument. I hope that one day our society will diverge fully from fossil fuels onto renewables, and I am trying to make that happen as best I can but I'm only one person with limited capital and influence doing what I believe is possible to make a difference. But getting back to the main reason for this post.

That statement. It felt like it negated all of the changes that my wife and I have made in the last four years trying to be more environmentally-conscious and pro-animal safety and health. We use as little plastic as we can. We recycle as much as we can. We share a vehicle and only use it when absolutely necessary. We rarely travel. We compost. We eat a vegan diet, and avoid animal products as much as we can when it comes to other products.

I refuse to quit because of things like that. I believe in the beauty of this planet and the right to life of all the beings on it. I will do what I can to help protect it. I don't even have kids (nor do I want them) but I do want them to be able to look forward to the future like I did when I was younger. I feel sorry for the generations after me. I feel like they are definitely getting the short stick in terms of crumbs to live off of after my generation and those before me are gone.

Everyone seems to have this ""all or nothing"" mentality when it comes to making real change when in fact, this is often not feasible at all. When it comes to being a vegan, we went all in on that right off the hop, but I find most people like to break into it slowly. Maybe cut out meat gradually, then dairy, then eggs. Small changes lead to big things when done on a large scale. I saw a statement somewhere once that really resonated with me. It was something to the effect of ""We don't need a few people making major changes to get things on track, we need the majority of people making a few changes"".

This is a fact of life ... and the marvellous thing about a fact is that one can not argue with it. One can argue about a belief, an opinion, a theory, an ideal and so on ... but a fact: never. One can deny a fact – pretend that it is not there – but once seen, a fact brings freedom from choice and decision. Most people think and feel that choice implies freedom – having the freedom to choose – but this is not the case. Freedom lies in seeing the obvious, and in seeing the obvious there is no choice, no deliberation, no agonising over the ‘Right’ and ‘Wrong’ judgment. In the freedom of seeing the fact there is only action.

When it comes to the consumption of nutrients there are many and various beliefs one can hold dearly to. There are people who will not eat red meat at all ... only white meat and fish. Then there are people who will not eat any flesh of warm-blooded animals at all ... only fish and reptiles. Then there are people (**vegetarians**) who will not eat any meat at all, but will consume eggs and dairy products. Then there are people (**vegans**) who will eat only vegetables, grain and seed. Then there are people (**fruitarians**) who will only eat fruit. Then – as we go into myth and fantasy – there are those who live on water and air ... and finally those who live on air only!

Some vegetarians maintain that as a carrot (for example) does not scream audibly when it is pulled from the ground there is no distress caused by the consumption of vegetables. Yet the carrot indubitably dies slowly by being extracted from its life-support system – the ground is its home – and is this not distressing on some level of a living, growing organism? It all depends upon the level, or degree, of ‘aliveness’ that one ascribes to things. Vegans, for instance, will not consume eggs as this prevents an incipient life from being born. Fruitarians go one step further and say that, as the consumption of carrots prevents them from going to seed and sprouting new life, vegetables are to be eschewed entirely. Then, as the eating of grain and seeds also prevent potential life-forms from growing, they will eat only the flesh of the fruit that surrounds the kernel and plant out the embryo plant-form (I have been a fruitarian so I know full well what I am speaking of).

The obvious fact is clearly demonstrated by taking all this to its ultimate consideration. What will one do – as a fruitarian causing no pain or the taking of life of anyone or anything – about those pesky things like mosquitoes, sand-flies, cockroaches, rats, mice and other ‘vermin’ that invade my house? Put up screens? What about outside? Will I slap them dead ... or just shoo them away? What will one do if attacked by a snake, a crocodile, a shark, a lion and so on? Do as the Revered Scriptures say and turn the other cheek? Will I humbly submit to my fate and be mauled severely myself – or even killed – simply because of a religious injunction, a moral scruple, a noble ideal, a virtuous belief, a passionate opinion, a deeply held ethical theory? In other words, have animals and insects been given the right, by some inscrutable god, to do with me whatsoever they wish? Is my survival dependent upon the non-existent benevolence of all those sentient beings that I am not going to cause distress to?

What then about germs, bacteria, bacillus, microbes, pathogens, phages, viruses and so on? Are they not entitled to remain alive and pain free? If one takes medication for disease, one is – possibly painfully – killing off the microscopic creatures that one’s body is the host too. Some religions – the Jain religion in India, for example – has its devout members wearing gauze over their nose and mouths to prevent insects from flying in and they even carry small brooms to sweep the path as they walk so that they will not accidentally step on some creature. It can really get out of hand. For instance, small-pox has been eradicated from the world by scientists as a means of saving countless human lives ... is this somehow ‘Wrong’? What is ‘Right’ in regards to what I do in order to stay alive? If I do none of these things then I will be causing pain and suffering to myself ... and I am a sentient being too. It is an impossible scenario, when pursued to its ultimate conclusion.

And then there is the matter of one’s fellow human beings. Some of them – in fact at times a lot of them – are desirous of invading the country that one is living peacefully in, with the avowed intent of killing, torturing, raping, pillaging and subjugating oneself and one’s fellow citizens. If one holds a strong and passionate belief in not causing any pain and suffering to other sentient beings then one must be more than a fruitarian ... one must be a pacifist as well. This amounts to hanging out a sign – if everybody else in the country one lives in adopts this specific belief – which says, in effect: ‘Please feel free to invade us, we will not fight back, for we hold firmly to the principle of not causing pain and suffering to any sentient being whatsoever’ (the Tibetan situation is a particular case in point).

So basically to go vegan. 🌱

I'm female, 21, and a Vegetarian for a couple of years already, and actually a huge cheese fan. Yikes.

How I ended up in my situation:
After I turned Vegetarian, I regularly got a rash or something at the finger knuckles of my right hand  - It swells, turns red, tickles and when you touch it, it hurts. This would occur every few months from then, staying for two weeks and then disappear. I hoped it would go away at some point. (I can't tell if turning Vegetarian was the reason it appeared,  I just know it's been happening for couple of years now)

Then a few months ago I started to get a stomach ache consistently, nearly every day. It's not strong or anything, but just always there.
It also didn't get better when I switched to oat milk (which is so much better than normal milk, whowie!). 🥳

Now I've went to let someone check my hand, and she was asking me if it occurs when I'm on my period, which isn't the case. (It could be because of hormones).
 So next she asked me how my stomach is feeling and I admitted that it troubles me a lot (Funnily I had to think for a moment cause the tummy ache was so normal for me 😅). 
She said, my intestine, so my stomach isn't alright, it afflicts my skin. She recommended me to leave out any milk products for at least four weeks and watch it. 👍🏻

Soooo I'm excited to go vegan!
Problem: I'm still living with my parents who aren't tooooo happy about me being Vegetarian already.... but they get vegetarian options for me at least. 🙈
But I can't stay dependant on them forever! Especially if I happen to become Vegan. I cant expect them to cook for me anymore. I need to... grow up 😱

But.... I'm just a terrible cook, and to be completely I've never been interested in cooking. It seems like such a bothersome task.. coming up with an idea, getting ingredients, stand there for 2 hours... 🙄 I'm lazy, I recognised it myself, thank you.
 
So I'm asking you guys for ANY useful advise that you can give me. Whether it is about motivating myself to cook, or vegan recipes, or venting about me being lazy, anything!
Also, do you agree with her theory that the skin rash is directly connected to my stomach condition?

The story is somewhat funny. I'm 17, come from a family living in a rural nowhere. Family's quite conservative and all. And basically, my mother started having troubles with her arm, which hurt a lot, two months ago. She can't do all the things she did before so my parents...Dumped it all on me. I'm the only girl and I have two brothers. Before that, it was my mother doing most of the chores and all, with me helping. Now it's me who have to do it all, my parents' words ""But even if we ask them, they won't do it, they'll do it wrong"". 

Ok.

Mind you my dad won't do shit either, of course.

&amp;#x200B;

So I decided to make it suck. As I said it's quite a conservative family and for some reason my little brother had something specifically against vegans. Literally would make up obviously fake stories about ""annoying vegan girls"" at school that he dissed (he is 15, also I'm literally in the same school). My whole family is the kind that'd say ""Bacon lol"" if someone says they are vegan.

I'm the one doing all the cooking now. So we went vegan. They hate it by principle. They hate it especially when I make something good and they ask what's in it and realize it's vegan. Now they aren't fooled anymore and just say everything tastes disgusting by default. Mind you none of them have taken up cooking lmao. They have taken up snacking madly on junk food though. 

Looking for vegan recipes made me read more and more into veganism. And definitely convinced me slowly but surely. And I discovered lots of vegan alternatives to foods I used to love (though there isn't much vegan meat and whatever where I live lmao). 

I will be leaving to move to another city for university in about a month, and I don't see myself going back to my previous diet.",True,False,False,vegan,t5_2qhpm,590329,public,self,,,Accidentally converted myself to veganism for life,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/ms3wqf/accidentally_converted_myself_to_veganism_for_life/,,all_ads,6,,,,,,,

The purpose of buying and cooking on a vegan diet is mainly animal condition and environmental protection (at least on my case) but, whatever it is, we have to have more people trying and enjoying plant recipes!

I just need to vent to people who actually kind of get it because I'm in a really bad headspace with it right now. The whole thing really fucked me up. 

I have friends in a discord server. One of them I've known for about a year. The others are newer friends. The friend I know has always been very serious about immediately stopping any sort of mockery or bashing towards another person, and they've always been open minded, which is a quality in them I've always admired.

Well today, they bring up a certain controversial vegan activist in the chat, which is fine. I was a bit nervous because I was scared the conversation would go wrong, but these people are aware that I am vegan, and there are other vegans in the server as well. I figured that they could have their conversation respectfully, and chose not to participate. 

Well, it got out of hand. All of a sudden there's these "" Lol I bet \[activist\] is one of those vegans who xx"", and ""lol vegans like that make me want to eat a ton of meat"", and just things that were extremely offensive to me, especially because these people were having a completely different conversation with me in another channel while saying all of this.

Anyway, I finally said something, because it was genuinely giving me anxiety, and they just seemed like...more interested in telling me that I'm wrong than actually listening to me when I say that xx or xx is wrong and is extremely offensive to say. They essentially asked me why it was offensive, and I told them, and they told me I was wrong, and then when I said otherwise they just shut the whole thing down.

I don't know. I just feel..judged? Secretly? And also it feels very backhanded that all other mockery towards any group or anything is banned, but this was okay? Like maybe that's how they really feel about me? And maybe I'm not really wanted in that space either way. Which frankly, I don't want to be in spaces that treat me like that.

I don't know. It just feels really shitty, because I feel backstabbed. Maybe I expected something in the friendship in regards to a level of respect for my ethics and beliefs, because if I said something really offensive about a friend of mine's beliefs, I'd want to know so that I can apologize and make sure they knew that I understood how offensive that could be, and that I'd do what I could to ensure that sort of conversation wouldn't happen again.

Maybe I'm just selfish for expecting someone to alter their conversations around me. Its hard to say. I just feel really shitty and now my anxiety is a fucking mess.

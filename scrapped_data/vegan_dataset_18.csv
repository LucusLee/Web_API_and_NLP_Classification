Anyway, I'm not allowed to talk about it with my family because they'll say, ""You can't bring up dogs, it's not the same thing! You have your opinions and we have ours."" So while they're sitting eating lamb or veal and I just don't say a word, they still don't know why I'm upset? Then they'll keep asking, ""What's bothering you? I know you! I know you're upset about something!!!"" What do you want me to answer?

If I say, ""I'm upset because of the animal abuse,"" they'll say that's just an opinion. ""You can't let yourself get upset about that, you always ruin our fun, we're just trying to celebrate and have a good time!"" I'm not allowed to be sad that you celebrate life and special occasions by killing babies? 

They've many times told me I'm not allowed to talk about it and they get mad when I do, and their answer is always the same: ""That's just your opinion! Opinions are subjective, you can't tell us how to live our lives. Live and let live. I respect your choice to be vegan, you should respect our choice not to!""

And yet, the other day I decided (in the privacy of my own home while eating in front of the couch) to lick my plate. My sister looked at me and said ""That's disgusting!"" 

So to maybe give her an idea, I said ""Well that's just your opinion! You can't tell me how to live my life. I respect your choice not to lick plates, respect my choice to do it!"" She could not believe what she heard, like I was some kind of crazy person, and said to me, **""Well SOME things are OBJECTIVELY wrong!""** 

Hmm, so violently killing a baby animal is just a subjective opinion that doesn't concern anyone but you and me, but which utensil I decide to touch with my mouth based on arbitrary social mores is ""objective""? 

It bugs me because they always tell me what to do, and say something is ""rude,"" and constantly judge everything I do. But when I even get upset and don't say a word because of systematic mass slaughter, I'm out of line and no one should ever judge. Every single thing they think is worthy of judging people for seems like *nothing* compared to the seriousness of what the meat industry is doing to the world, and yet they *laugh* making fun of vegans in mocking voices going ""mEaT iS mUrDeR HAHAHAHAHAHAHA BUNCH OF CRAZIES 😂""

Another thing that happened is when I go grocery shopping to buy vegan stuff and my mom asks me to pick up some meat or dairy. I've told her many times why I'm not comfortable doing that, and even asked her what she would do if someone asked her to go kill a dog for her, saying ""You don't have to *eat* it, it's not for *you*, don't be selfish!"" And yet nope, she still thinks I'm selfish for ""literally forcing"" my views on her. Last time I said no, she says to me, **""I understand you have your opinions and you're very passionate, but sometimes you have to put your beliefs aside and do the right thing!""**

""The right thing"" is killing baby animals, and my ""belief"" is that I don't personally like it? She doesn't realize I could say the exact same thing to her, right? Put *your* beliefs (that 5 minutes of enjoyment on your tastebuds is a good reason to kill a baby animal) aside, and do the right thing (leave them alone).

Sometimes I want to give up hope and feel useless.

I’m fine with that, I don’t care what they eat, I just wanna know how to cope with knowing that people I love and respect are informed enough to realize what goes on and simply don’t care.

My mom insists that she can’t live without meat, and that our local, organic farm is different from the big ones. She’s a bit more in denial IMO, and she just gets real quiet when I bring up the horrors.

My dad, on the other hand, isn’t in any denial, he just doesn’t care. I’ve told him what goes on, (not in an annoying way, I wanted him to understand why I was upset, not for him to stop eating meat), so it’s fair to assume he knows, he just doesn’t care. His reason for not caring is that “there’s no way to ethically feed billions of people” and “you don’t wanna know how the sausage gets made”.

I respect my dad so much and I know he’s a good person, but it bothers me that he doesn’t care. Also, he has kind of a history of viewing animals as objects, in a way. He has a fish tank and referred to cheaper fish as being “expendable”, meaning he doesn’t care if they die.

I believe in the good in people and that most people don’t care because they don’t know. But my dad knows and doesn’t care. And it upsets me. Again, I’m not trying to meddle in their lifestyle, I just don’t understand why they’re like this.

A lot of answers I have found on Google or with minimal research. It hasn’t been easy but I’m definitely committed to doing this.

In any case, my question is about sodas.
When I started, I had read that white sugar has bone char, making it an animal product. I wasn’t really much of a soda drinker but to satisfy that crave, I would have the Coke bottles imported from Mexico since it’s made from sugar cane.

As I’ve visited vegan restaurants, they often have fountain drinks with coke products. Are fountain drink sodas vegan? Am I looking at normal soda wrong thinking it has bone char?

That isn't a good enough reason to discount a lifestyle. Honestly, I'm trying to put together a lifestyle that is more centered around self care, and I haven't been putting enough effort into the food that I eat.

Why is it that the total use of animal products is inhumane, and not just the consumption of meat? Isn't the use of animal products derived from non-lethal uses just a result of a symbiotic relationship between man and animal? Is it possible for humans to have relationships with animals that isn't destructive and exploitative?

Human beings sell and provide human made products like blood, breastmilk, DNA, etc. Is that inhumane to do? Or is that different than the use of animal products? If so, how?

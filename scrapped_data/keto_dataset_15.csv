I'm M46, having struggled for the vast majority of my life with my weight, going up to 330lbs at my peak in my late 20s, yo yo-ing up and down, stabilizing at about \~275 for a few years until I decided about 15 years ago to go through bariatric surgery and get a lap band. That helped me out for a while, bringing my weight down to about 225, but I was building a ton of muscle at that point, going to the gym 5 days a week for a mix of light cardio and strength. And then, of course, ""life got in the way"". I work in tech, which meant long hours, grabbing whatever I could eat, and things crept up.

Over the last 20 years, I've also been suffering from mild clinical depression. Nothing crazy, but enough to add to the ""uggggggghh"" aspect of life and exercise, and coming up with excuses not to do X, Y, or Z. Unsurprisingly, things were a lot better during my ""healthy"" period, and my psychiatrist has often recommended focusing on my weight loss to get better. Easier said than done, especially when living in my head!

The challenge for me has been trust, and accountability. I'm married, with 2 kids, and am the cook of the house. My wife has known me forever (40+ years), and has seen me through all of my phases. I love her to death, and I know she means well, but she can be very judgmental, and over the years, I've lost my ability to have a proper discussion around anything regarding my health, or weight. I just get incredibly defensive, and change the subject.

I've also tried, and somewhat successfully lost a decent chunk of weight. A few years back, I got into golfing (after years of making fun of my parents), and started WW at the time and dropped a good 25lbs in a few weeks. But I would do all of this avoiding conversations with the family, or even mentioning I was doing it. Given I'm the cook in the house, it didn't lead to good, sustaining results. This accountability problem didn't just lie with how I interacted with my family, heck, my feeling of repeated failure kept pushing me to delay visits to doctors for checkups, and given my family has a long history of diabetes, and some heart disease, it was incredibly irresponsible. I'm a walking heart attack waiting to happen. I'd always push my reminders out a few months until ""I'd lose enough weight to have some good news to give my dr as she gave me the look of disappointment."".

A few months back, I realized that a year of quarantine killed what little exercise I was getting at work, and my days consisted of 10 hours on my desk chair, a few hours with the family, and then a few hours watching TV or back to work. My sleeping patterns were messed up because I'd choose to fall asleep on the couch, setting my alarm for \~5am to then go up to bed, so my wife could get a really good night sleep without me snoring next to her (no sleep apnea, but boy, I can be a trumpet). My back is shot, I can barely walk straight, and am in constant pain. I'm an 80 year old man in a 40something body. The thought of the pandemic being over and the world going back to ""normal"" is both exciting, but also agonizing. No more excuses to do absolutely nothing.

While my depression has always been fairly mild, I've lost family members to suicide, and would never ever every think of inflicting something like that on my own family and friends. But hey, if I died from a heart attack, would that be so bad? I felt like I hit rock bottom. 

I know it sounds dumb, but it took all my courage to sit down with my wife and tell her that it was time, I was seeking help, and that while I knew she meant well, I needed her to give me some room here. I'd tried keto a few times for short periods of time, and it suits me well in general as I'm not really a carbs person anyhow (but doing it in hiding is incredibly difficult...). I decided to bite the bullet, and sign up to Virta Health, buy a peloton, and say screw it - I'll be the guy who comes in 100 thousandth on leaderboards for a while, but I know I'll be better. Two things that work with me: accountability and gamification. Virta holds me accountable. No hiding, the coach is on you daily, everything's measured. It forced me to go to the dr and get results (and I'm just incredibly lucky that despite all the abuse my body has taken, my blood sugars and cholesterol numbers are high, but below any problematic numbers... Peloton, once I get started, gamifies things. I started on Duolingo learning Japanese a couple of years back for the fun of it, and not only kept going regardless of what was going on, but made me decide to take formal lessons and go to Japan. All that because of that damn streak :)

I know all of this is irrelevant to all of you, but honestly, /r/keto has been an inspiration for the last few years, and seeing all of your stories was really the inspiration to get started. This is just the beginning, but I wanted to say thank you for nudging me to get on the bandwagon that I'm sure I'll fall off of, but get back on again. I owe it to myself, and my amazing family.

I had had problems having healthcare prior to now, and was able to get it in January, after not having it for a long time, but I suspected that was the case for some time now.

After 5 weeks, I went back for a follow-up.  My A1C1 is down 2 entire points in only 5 weeks, with keto (15 lbs weight loss) and metformin.  It's almost at normal range, and is *currently* normal, based on my blood glucose tests.  The A1C1 will assuredly go down some more in a couple months after the metformin and keto have been doing their stuff in synergy.  My doctor was impressed.  I have never seen a doctor be so perky and delighted!  He told me to keep up the good work, and complimented me three or four times.  I wasn't even sure how to take that much praise lol.  He also said he thought I could reverse my diabetes, get off of the metformin, and should strive for that.  Lucky break there, getting the doctor who knows this is possible, and doesn't just treat it like it's a done deal!

I hope this story, however simple, helps other people see how good this way of eating can be.  I know the doctor is right, and I'm going to keep on fighting for my life and *quality* of life.

After I had my daughter in August 2019 I thought the baby weight would fall off as soon as I went back to work (Registered Nurse, on feet all day). Boy, was I better.

I spent the first few months battling PPD and post partum hypertension.

I went back to work carry most of my pregnancy weight. Cue the start of the pandemic last May. I sent my daughter to live with my dad who has multiple ailments because my husband and I are both nurses- him in a hospital and I in long term care. My father normally babysits my daughter a few days a week for us and getting her every day would put him at risk.

I was the most depressed I had ever been at that point. I missed my 6 month old more than anything but the pandemic was new and we were all afraid. I missed her first Easter and nearly milestones for the month she was with my dad. I couldn't take it. I gorged.

Taking her back a month later was terrifying but thankfully we all stayed healthy at the time (I recently had covid- mild for me at least. Other family members did not fair as well). It was then I realized I needed to do better for myself and for her.

I stayed the same weight the past couple weeks without any significant change to exercise or diet.  They say weightloss is nonlinear.  It becomes amplified as you get closer to goal.

I am even excited... EXCITED, for my annual physical checkup next week.  I never thought I would say that.  Before I put off annual checkups because I loathed the inevitable lecture about how I should try to lose some weight.  Almost ashamed at what I had done to my body...Not anymore!!

My runners knee pain has been on and off but the weather finally broke and I have been biking a few times a week.  I also picked up some resistance bands to work on building up muscles that don't get used very much running.  My knee has already started feeling better by focusing on low impact exercise.

I bumped up my macros closer to maintenance last week and wow. It's a ton of food.  I'll be bumping all the way up to maintenance tomorrow.  Then somehow figure out an accurate way to account for exercise calories.  I rarely ate into them during my initial weight loss period.  I will probably just eat half of what fitbit says the exercise was and adjust as required.  Seems to be a popular method.

Thank you again to everyone that takes the time to share their knowledge, trials, and inspiration on this sub.  It helped me (and my wife) a lot!

After an emotionally draining week of family drama and funeral events...its hitting me hard. I haven’t fell off my diet or really felt like cheating...but mentally I’m running low. Self-esteem and motivation are in the gutter and I’m feeling super self-critical. Hormones are a trip. I decided to make a list of NSV’s to stay positive and keep this this keto train going. 

1. Out of all the causes of stress earlier this week, getting dressed was NOT one of them! Getting dressed up fancier than normal is usually dreadful and just uncomfortable, especially if I’m wearing a dress. This time...it wasn’t even a thought. Everything just fit and fit well. Brought the stress level down a ton. 

2. M/L size stockings no longer make me feel like suffocating. They don’t make me look like a stuffed sausage or leave a horrible red itchy mark on my stomach for hours after taking them off. Tbh, this may have been because I could never admit my size😅. They seem to be not catching runs either because of the lesser amount of stretch. Woo! 

3. Regular width flats no longer give me sharp pains on my feet. I never wear certain shoes because I have bad feet/bunions. Particular styles (like flats) I have to go for the wide choice and even then I never buy them. Holy moly! I’m still the same size 8 but now I can wear this regular width shoe with little problem?? I bought these sleek, kind of narrow looking flats. Who am I? My feet shrank! 

4. I’m no longer sweating (even with a mask) when I do a simple task like going to take the dogs out and chatting with neighbors. This one really bothered me before and it was soo awkward. Something about the mix of being overweight, overheating, and being self conscious would make me sweat (my face in particular) as soon as I leave my home or have to converse with someone. I would literally cut conversation short to run off. If it’s a makeup day, double whammy. I used to chalk this up to anxiety. Welp, no. I was just fat. Now I’m easy breezy lemon squeezey! Hell, I even get cold sometimes. 

5. I’m finding it much easier to track my monthly cycle and symptoms on keto. When I ate all the carbs and whatever I wanted, it was always so difficult to know where pain, inflammation, stomach aches, etc was coming from. Bloated and feel like shit, well is it the whole pizza I ate last night or is ovulation early? Short tempered with a headache, is it the crash from the sugary danishes or is shark week coming? These questions are so simplified for me now because my diet is on point and I know how keto makes me feel, so it’s easier to track outside symptoms. As a woman, this makes me feel really good knowing my body. 

When you’re feeling low and life is kicking you in the behind...remember you’re making changes and doing the damn thing. 5 pounds or 50. It doesn’t matter. Every small victory counts. Please comment if you can think of any or just want to get something off your chest 😊🙏🏼. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk, girls and boys. 21 lbs down and 19 lbs to go. KCKO!

I'm starting to realize that isn't the case. If I'm trying to lose weight, I need to also limit my fat intake and do workouts. I appreciate this, and I'll try to adjust myself accordingly. Which means I can't just eat a pound of bacon with my eggs every morning, I suppose.

I started Keto on 26th of February and it’s been a really learning process for me. I was quite happy because I lost 7 kg (15.43 lbs) in such a short time.

I also walk everyday between (4-5km) plus I work as a shop assistant and I’m all around always walking everywhere. 

You probably see so many posts about stalling but this is something new for me and when I feel unmotivated and sad I always feel like I’m stuck in a situation that I want to fix but I don’t know how. Maybe I just need some words of encouragement or maybe you guys know some way I can improve.

My symptoms are always worse when I am overweight, i was told to never ever again attempt a low carb diet.




I was never told why this happened to me despite even one of the nurses on the ward being on keto at the time I was staying there.





It was literally put down to a mystery and I was blamed, they say I was crash dieting and that I had anorexic tendencies.
I have always struggled with eating too much not too little.





I wondered it anyone else has suffered a near death experience with keto? 
I was supplementing with no salt, magnesium and potassium, yet it still led to a slow decline :/

(I added the kids and husband to give you an idea of my daily life...not a single mom but it can feel like I am) Successfully did keto almost 2 years ago, lost 30 lbs, felt amazing. Got pregnant with the 3rd (yay!) but gained it all back and then some. I now work from home which has its pros and cons. I am having a *really* hard time going back to keto and sticking with it. A few reasons: 1) I’m so damn tired most of the time, struggling with off and on sleep issues with the baby 2) in a food rut? Nothing sounds good, ever so I tend to just eat easy crap 3) my husband’s off days are triggers cause he will go to the store and buy food that’s tempting/we finally all get to be together and relax which also leads to more relaxed eating 4) I’m an emotional eater so if I get an emotional trigger, it’s SO hard to fight 5) meal planning for my family and then myself separately is exhausting, I despise it, so I usually count myself out and just get what the rest of the family needs (I’m aware that I need to take care of myself but it doubles my “work” in preparing for the week so I just short change my own stuff)

We just invested in a home gym setup so I now get to do strength training when I can fit it in which is usually my lunch breaks. Having the flexibility to work it into my schedule is amazing. I know keto is the best option for my way of eating. I honestly think I have a carb intolerance, even incorporating a little here and there works against me. I have literally been fighting between 203-200 lbs for months and months. The lowest I’ve gotten is 197 and that lasted a day. Vacillating between these 3 lbs is making me inSANE and just want to sCrEaM. I already have my food logged for tomorrow, ready to start and having a plan helps, of course. 

And if I’m being honest, this not being *new* is working against me. The first time I did keto it was NEW and exciting and it was awesome. Now it’s like, oh ok, I know what I need to do but it’s not *exciting*. Does that make sense at all?? I would love to hear from anyone and everyone.

This is a very low carb wrap made from eggs and cauliflower. It is very thin and tears easily. You will probably want to use two at a time. It's spongy and has almost no taste. According to the package it has 0 TOTAL carbs.

These are large oversized pieces of Mozarella Cheese. They also claim to have 0 TOTAL carbs.

These are oversized pieces of cheddar cheese.  Taste is mild, and they have a tendency to rip if you overstuff them. 1 g of TOTAL carbs.

I have Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. For over 20 years now. It’s been very stable for the last 10. I’ve lost 30+ pounds on keto. Lately tho, I was getting really hungry, and losing my control. Also struggling with horrible insomnia, which made me of course, completely exhausted during the day. I was thinking it was perimenopause symptoms. 

Then my hands started shaking. I knew right away. Went and got lab work done, and sure enough I’m hyper. That means I’m getting too much thyroid hormone. This can cause insomnia, heart racing, hand shaking, increased appetite....lots of fun things...sometimes it takes me a hot minute to figure out that it is a thyroid hormone fluctuation. Especially now, because it’s been so stable for so long. 

Once before I lost weight, 100 pounds, on WW, and my levels went up. A lot! Which seems counter intuitive. You would think, lost weight, lower blood volume, you would need LESS hormone. Nope, needed more. 🤷‍♀️ but sometimes this stupid disease is annoying like that. But this time I wonder about the GF aspect of this diet. I had a friend who was diagnosed, went GF, and never had to go on meds. Citing the inflammatory nature of gluten.

Hi everyone, I'm just 5 weeks into my keto journey, and swapped to my new macros just a few days ago so hopefully the weightloss improves - I'm still very happy with 14lbs though! I'm taking that as 10lbs water weight for the first week, and then about 1lb per week thereafter which is right on target. 

But weightloss aside, I wanted to share how keto has positively affected me, to try and encourage others to stick it out, even if their weightloss journey has been a bit of a bumpy ride. 

Joint pain - As a young person, experiencing chronic severe joint pain in my fingers and moderate pain in one of my knees for the past few years was painful and frustrating. Before lockdown I went to trapeze and pole fitness classes twice a week, but falls on any of these areas would result in pain that would take weeks to subside. I was told my symptoms were typical of rheumatoid arthritis, but I'd have to go in for further tests to confirm this. Since swapping to keto, my finger pain has disappeared entirely, and my knee pain is barely there. I really believe in this diet for reducing inflammation.

Spots / acne - In that same vein, the skin on my face has never been better. Whilst I only had mild acne on my cheeks, the overall quality of my skin was poor with it being bumpy, uneven, and red in places. The redness and spots have gone, and I cannot believe that the uneven texture I had, especially in places like my forehead where it's impossible to miss, has disappeared. 

Fat and water deposits - The first major change I experienced when I lost the initial water weight was the change in skin quality of my thighs. I use to sit on the toilet and look down at my thighs and hate their appearance; not quite cellulite, but lumpy all the same. The skin there has now evened out and the lumps are gone. I wonder if this is where water was being retained unevenly in places between the skin and fat?  

Bloating - Before keto I was frequently bloated and had stomach pains due to 1) the food I was eating, and 2) a bad habit I had of swallowing air when I was hungry. Despite still drinking the likes of Coke Zero, I haven't experience any bloating or pain whilst on keto, and my better, more fulfilling meals are helping with my air swallowing habit. 

Energy levels - I use to suffer from the post lunch slump and, as I'm currently working from home, would have to take a 2hr nap in the afternoon before returning to work. When I was working in the office, this would of course be impossible so my productivity would just cease to exist and I'd be sat at my desk managing to do next to no work. Happy to say that I've shockingly not had a single nap since starting keto. I'm able to go the entire day with my levels of productivity being pretty consistent throughout. 

Brain fog - Likewise, my brain fog has gone. I struggled focussing on tasks, and was frequently overwhelmed by large amounts of data (I create simulations for the oil and gas industry, so handle a lot of numbers). I feel like my mind is sharper now and I'm less likely to have my eyes ""glaze"" over. 

Mood - I suffer from stress and anxiety. Whether it's just down to making a positive impact in my life, or whether it's the diet itself, I can't remember the last time I felt this good. I feel happy, optimistic and like a metaphorical weight has been lifted from me, even before the phsyical weight has gone. For the first time in 7 years, I'm starting to feel like I'm getting myself back. 

Sleep - No more struggling to sleep. I'm getting a good, undisturbed night of sleep each night, and have gone from being that person who hits the snooze button on their alarm clock a million times, to waking up before my alarm. 

Relationship with food - I hated food. I was a high carb snack eater because I hated preparing meals. Now I actually enjoy the process of researching what I'm going to make, getting creative with recipes, and then getting hands on with making it. Keto's restrictions remove some of the overwhelming choice there is with food, and working within those confines actually makes it easier to come up with interesting dishes. 

Hopefully some of my experience can act as motivation for others, so thanks for letting me share ☺️",True,False,False,keto,t5_2rske,2348160,public,self,My Keto Journey | How my quality of life has improved after just 5 weeks,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/mf0p5j/my_keto_journey_how_my_quality_of_life_has/,all_ads,6,,success,a8bb6b80-abe7-11e8-8696-0ed9e0d77ef8,Success Story,,,,,

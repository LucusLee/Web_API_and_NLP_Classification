People post pictures of graphic depictions of NH animal abuse without any sort of tag or filter.  These images are triggering in nature, and while they have a place to be shown, should be enforced as having to be tagged as NSFW.

I'd go so far as to say that it is actually speciesist for us to not treat the victims in these images with the same respect that we would a human. When the image of a human is graphic, we acknowledge the graphic, triggering, and disturbing nature of the image by tagging it as NSFW. When we post the same images towards NH animal abuse, however, we often leave

Now some may say that one could just look at another sub and leave this one, but its written well in the rules, under ""nonvegan posts"":

&gt; Do not under any circumstances post content, such as recipes, food pictures, news, cross-posts, and so forth, which include, glorify **or display the result of animal abuse, exploitation or cruelty**. This may result in an immediate ban and posts will be removed. 

I acknowledge fully that this rule exists, but I feel like it is being reinterpreted based off of the bias that if the image is technically ""pro vegan"", or if the images are somehow spun in a ""pro vegan"" way, then its seen as okay.  It really isn't, especially when you're dealing with such triggering content that often goes untagged and unflaired.

If I'm going to bring up a problem, I like to propose solutions to go along with it, so these are mine:

* Make the rule regarding this content its own rule, rather than falling under the category of ""no nonvegan posts"". This would allow us to report with the correct context, especially because a post can technically be pro vegan yet still break the rules.
* Specify in greater detail what is considered by the mods to be ""graphic images"", and under what context are they or are they not accepted, and how they are to be responsibly posted.

I'm not saying this is exactly what has to be done. I just want to start the conversation.

I am simply making my point and asking for help on the matter, because I am seriously at a loss.)

For those unfamiliar, he discusses a variety of topics, notably theology and philosophy, but touches on veganism quite often as well. 

It’s fair to say that until recently, I never really gave the concept of veganism much thought, as most people do, or rather *don’t* do, I suppose. To get straight to the point, I’m experiencing some personal struggle in this regard. I’m sure many of you have experienced the same. I guess I’m seeking some guidance in my direction from here. 

I think there’s strong case to be made for veganism on moral grounds in regards to the suffering of animals; notably, I have a problem with the current state of the food industry. This is largely propagated by a life changing awakening I’ve had in recent months, that paints a much bigger picture. I won’t go into too much detail on that for now since it’s not 100% applicable, but briefly: I am experiencing a growing resentment for the total reliance on the modern system we’ve been set up to live by, and only by it (that being big industries and corporations). This includes, especially, the food industry.

So on the topic of the meat industry, our population numbers have increased so much in recent centuries that we no longer have a need to hunt for food. We breed and manufacture animals for the sole purpose of eating them, and often times these facilities lack proper oversight, you’ve seen the videos of the undercover investigations. It’s horrific. It’s unnatural. 

So where do I stand in all of this? I feel a growing guilt for consuming manufactured meat. I could simply stop eating it, but it’s difficult to do when I’m surrounded by people who do eat manufactured meat and have zero problem with it. As it stands, I recognize our omnivorous nature, and I recognize the natural state of the world. There’s always going to be an impersonal, uncaring, necessary balance between predator and prey. That said, I don’t think I would have a problem with consuming meat, so long as I am the one that hunts, and does so correctly so as to not cause any undue suffering to an animal. I also don’t see a problem in utilizing an animal’s resources as long as they don’t suffer in the process. 

This is a process, so please don’t bash me for holding these opinions. It’s why I’m here, to seek knowledge, understanding, to think things all the way through, free of fallacy, and most importantly, to be the best version of myself I can be.

I'm a long time vegetarian who has been trying to go fully vegan for a while. I've never eaten eggs because I honestly can't stand them. Half of it is the flavour and I think half of it is the concept of an egg, even when I ate meat I found it kinda grotesque.  
I am however always super curious about vegan replacement recipes and I've seen a few carbonaras and tofu scrambled eggs that use black salt. I keep wanting to get hold of some black salt and try out these recipes, but I'm unsure if black salt tastes so similar to eggs that I'll undeniably hate it haha

My mom has recently said she has become vegan for her health. I tell her that she is in actuality on a “plant based” because veganism is a value system and lifestyle against animal cruelty, exploitation, and injustice.

Also she isn’t even strictly plant based. She admitted she ate eggs and bacon the other day saying she doesn’t have to be a perfect “vegan” to be “vegan” and that I should just support her for trying.

If they are let to roam free cows will be breaking into peoples land, running on roads, in peoples front lawns to get grass. 

Also what do you do in the winter? In temperate climate countries grass doesn't grow in winter all the cows would literally die they'd have nothing to eat. They are completely reliant on farmers to feed them in the winter. 

Also think about newborn calves. Besides the fact cows need help sometimes to calve, when they are born they would not survive the nights in autumn, winter or even spring as those nights are cold. And again you have the problem of if the calf is drinking the correct milk, too much or too little. And new calves easily get sick they need different supplements which they wouldn't get.

Also even if those calves survived, in a couple years you have a bunch of bulls running around freely. Bulls are dangerous.

All of this needs to be managed. So they need to be owned by a farmer on a farm.

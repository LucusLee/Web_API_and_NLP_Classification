Drink water before and after meals to suppress hunger and make you feel fuller  

2. Stay hydrated, it's just healthy and helps any form of weight loss.  

3. Get some exercise in, nothing crazy. 30 minutes of walking is all you need, maybe 3-7 times a day. Exercising is not required for weight loss in keto diet.  

4. Try to eat as far into the day as possible so you don't end up eating too often.   

5. Limit how many meals you eat a day to avoid feeling. On a keto diet, you shouldn't feel hungry very often because your body is in ketosis, so take advantage of that to decrease caloric intake. Make sure to diversify your foods and get some veggies in to get proper nutrition.  

6. Avoid environments where non-keto foods are available. This is obvious but very important. If, for example, your family is eating cookies in the kitchen, stay in your room doing something else  

7. Keep in mind that the beginning of starting a keto diet is the hardest, then your cravings will go away and so is your appetite.   

8. You can still overeat on keto. No matter what diet or exercise plan you're on, if you're overeating, you'll see less results. Make sure that you're eating slowly and not having big proportions.  

9. Best to limit yourself up to 20 carbs. It's a limit, not a goal, you don't have to try to hit 20 carbs. Realize that this is the recommended maximum to guarantee ketosis. 

10. If you mess up, it's okay. I didn't stick to the keto diet on my first try. You have so many more times to try again.

So in March after losing out on GME (And a lot of research into carbs and sugar documentary and more etc but that's less dramatic) I decided to completely change my lifestyle and started a 1 week fast and then slowly moved to a 22 hours Intermittent fasting, slowly adding healthy foods.

Then after a bit, I started swapping stuff around then adding exercise, I decided to add a salad to the diet and experimented with eating times, now eating 2:10 pm Salad wise and 6:30-7 pm during the main meal (I eat the walnuts and dark chocolate right after dinner, so I count it as a main meal) time which I assume would count as a 6-hour eating window even though I only eat twice.

Though I can feel the difference from extremely unhealthy junk food and Irn Bru (fizzy drinks) every day to this diet, I lost about 15-18kg from the fast alone, though I plateaued a bit from then as I stayed at 120kg for 2 weeks, this could be from countless of things and I also started to do 1 hour walks every day in the morning and pushed my waking up time to 6:15 AM, so hopefully that speeds up the system health and metabolic wise",True,False,False,keto,t5_2rske,2358490,public,self,Made new lifestyle changes and wondering if what I eat would be considered Keto?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/mmv8vu/made_new_lifestyle_changes_and_wondering_if_what/,all_ads,6,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'Uc6tCuqaoZnhDL8nQ5PjC8xXLmfjKdpn1skfimlcVZ8', 'resolutions': [{'height': 145, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/eKgsPiWkr_a1HJXygmRCqxniFcSHTTnKp8koUKP9IXE.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b6d124b30a26452b2b8cd0eeb70f07783a68512', 'width': 108}, {'height': 290, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/eKgsPiWkr_a1HJXygmRCqxniFcSHTTnKp8koUKP9IXE.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2cb7fda22ac661fc0ebff753c2ebcd62dd48dd6', 'width': 216}, {'height': 430, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/eKgsPiWkr_a1HJXygmRCqxniFcSHTTnKp8koUKP9IXE.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9799fe059da35de786ef3057dc1ecca053acb0fa', 'width': 320}, {'height': 860, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/eKgsPiWkr_a1HJXygmRCqxniFcSHTTnKp8koUKP9IXE.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24b584eb168803ec4a2c7a63d6d2da74a42a2206', 'width': 640}], 'source': {'height': 1047, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/eKgsPiWkr_a1HJXygmRCqxniFcSHTTnKp8koUKP9IXE.png?auto=webp&amp;s=689d6104270974913711be131aba08aea0cc480a', 'width': 779}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,

I love the IF lifestyle, and don’t want to give up on the ketones just yet. I at least want to try a longer fast first.

*“I’m closer than ever to my goal weight! I have energy to do things with my children,”* Kendra says.

Here’s Kendra’s inspiring story, which has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

## Kendra’s keto journey

My name is Kendra, I’m 32 years old, and I live in the US Midwest.

﻿I started following the keto diet in April 2018. Since then, I’ve lost over 100 pounds (45 kilos)!

Initially, it wasn’t easy. I used to overdo it on snacks, sweets, and fast food. My portion sizes were out of control.

I realized that not only was I setting *myself* up for health issues, like diabetes, congestive heart failure, and high blood pressure that run in my family, but I was setting *my children* up for the same.

I decided enough was enough. A friend told me about the keto diet and the success she was having, and I started the next day.

These days, I cook at home and we rarely eat out. I’ve learned how to cook a variety of healthy and delicious meals. I can make just about any dish keto-friendly. I’ve also incorporated intermittent fasting. On most days, my eating window is 12 pm to 8 pm, and at least one day a week I do ‘one meal a day’ .

Of course, there have been times when I’ve eaten high-carb foods, but eating these foods only made me realize that my body just doesn’t agree with them. Low carb is what works best for me.

Several months ago, I also decided to quit a detrimental sugar addiction that developed after I quit alcohol. This is when I decided to make the change to the ketogenic WOE. (I did keto 3 years ago and really enjoyed how full of life it made me, so I wanted to return to it.)

It includes radically diminishing starch admission and supplanting it with fat. This decrease in carbs places your body into a metabolic state called ketosis. 

At the point when this occurs, your body turns out to be inconceivably effective at consuming fat for energy. It likewise transforms fat into ketones in the liver, which can supply energy for the mind (6Trusted Source). 

Ketogenic diets can cause huge decreases in glucose and insulin levels. This, alongside the expanded ketones, has some medical advantages (6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source, 8Trusted Source). 

Rundown 

The keto diet is a low carb, high fat eating regimen. It brings down glucose and insulin levels and moves the body's digestion away from carbs and toward fat and ketones. 

Various sorts of ketogenic slims down 

There are a few variants of the ketogenic diet, including: 

Standard ketogenic diet (SKD): This is a low carb, moderate protein and high fat eating regimen. It commonly contains 70% fat, 20% protein, and just 10% carbs (9Trusted Source). 

Repetitive ketogenic diet (CKD): This eating routine includes times of higher carb refeeds, for example, 5 ketogenic days followed by 2 high carb days. 

Directed ketogenic diet (TKD): This eating routine permits you to add carbs around exercises.

Preliminary thanks for your help.

I started keto last Monday, sub 20g carbs and meticulously tracking my electrolytes per the FAQ, and I just have a couple questions.

So the first 5 or so days I actually felt great, increased energy and clearer cognition, which is what I’m hoping keto can help me with, but after that I’ve begun to feel sluggish and just a little ... off. I don’t feel awful, it isn’t keto flu, I just feel a little lesser than. I searched around and found that almost every question like this ends up being answered by the deafening roar of everyone saying: ELECTROLYTES. 

So, to head that off, I promise you, I’ve been supplementing and tracking my electrolytes.

So my question is: At what point should I begin to consistently feel the benefits from keto (energy, cognition, etc.)? I’m on day 9 and feeling generally meh, but I’m willing to wait it out if that’s necessary. But I do wonder about the timeline, and possibly some tips on how to optimize my diet for therapeutic benefits.

  Then in the line at Trader Joes I saw some “sugarless” mints so I bought some and munched on them on the way home in the car.  They were so incredibly sweet I can't believe they were sugar free.  Maybe Stevia?

I made one yesterday and made decent size burger buns (similar to the jumbo store brands) out of them and then came at 80kcal each but they were rather gummy and had a rubbery crust? Any help? The dough was really sticky and taffy like if that makes sense. 

Used 
60g gluten
100g Oat Fiber
6g phylum husk
~2g gluccoman 
3g salt
6g instant yeast
4g date syrup
100g egg white 
~200-250g water

I started Keto a week ago - and after posting a little bit earlier, and reviewing posts I realized how lazy I was being. I have not been counting calories or macros - simply trying to avoid eating carbs.

I am always very confused by the amount of calories I should eat. I see people eating 1200-1500 calories at my weight - but when I research it it says that would be an unhealthy calorie restriction for me.

Hello! 

I am new to keto &amp; reddit. I started keto about a week ago. I believe that I am in ketosis (went through a period of exhaustion, peeing a lot, weird taste in mouth, etc.). A lot of the negative symptoms are now gone. I feel way less bloated now which is great.

My question for now is will things like Rebel ice cream &amp; diet soda slow down my progress ? I attempted Keto in the past and lost 13 pounds in one week. However, I was pretty strict then. I gave in on day 8.

Fast forward 6 months later and I weigh 30 pounds more. I want a diet that is sustainable. However, I don’t want diet soda or rebel to slow down my progress. I am not proud of it but I have probably ate 4 pints in my first week. Additionally, I have been having between 2-5 diet sodas a day. I know I should cut back. My cravings do not feel as strong now so hopefully I can.

Does anyone have any input, advice, thoughts, or information they can share with me to help? 

I would like to lose 80 pounds by December. I’m sincerely willing to do what it takes - open to learning!

You know the usual story, always been obese, major body image issues. 

Been doing the whole keto IF business in the past five months and it’s yielding results! 

Guys, I wore my first sleeveless halter neck top in public last week! 

My arms are still considerably plump, as am I. I am only halfway to my goal, after all. But I did not feel awkward anymore. 

Keto hasn’t just helped me on the weighing scale. It has helped boost my self esteem and confidence. I got quite a few compliments about the top as well and that honestly felt SO good. 

Here’s to incorporating more variety of outfits in my wardrobe. 

I hope you all are doing well and crushing your individual goals. Give this a chance, it’ll change everything. 

And it’s not just resolving physical issues, it is helping me heal my mind as well!

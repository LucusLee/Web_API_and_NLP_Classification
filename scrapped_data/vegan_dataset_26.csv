For example, 
I went to visit my dad and stepmother (farmers) last summer. 
I told them I was vegan so I wouldn’t be eating most of their food, I brought my own, no big deal right? 

My half-brother is a vegeterian slowly turning to veganism, so we were talking about it in the kitchen while my sister, brother in-law (also farmer) and stepmother were speaking to each other. 

When they heard what we were talking about they just HAD to start a debate about these things. I was pretty civil but they just were so fucking wrong about everything. 

They said the classic arguments: “we treat our animals well” and “that sort of treatment of animals doesnt happen in our country” and “where do you get your protein?” etc etc

Things got sort of heated on their end, I just quoted Earthling Ed mostly and defended my position. I didnt want to make things awkward so every fiber of my being went into being calm. 

Then my stepmother said: “We LOVE our animals” 
and I replied: “I dont believe you can love an animal, while killing it and profiting from their death”. 

I could tell it struck a nerve so I backed down but I could tell it made her very upset. 

Ever since she’s been very distant and cold to me.
I get it, I struck a nerve. 

But what I don’t get, is people who start a debate out of nowhere when I tell them Im vegan. Then when I defend myself and my position they act like Im “the crazy vegan who won’t shut up about veganism” 

They think I have no idea what Im talking about, that they’re smarter than me, that what they are doing is perfectly okay and that they can somehow “win” this debate with me, and I magically bow down to their intelligence since Im just a misinformed little girl.

I've linked my 6 month update above in case anyone wants to read it. I'm 35, British, male, and live in Rome, Italy. The Friday after we locked down here for covid (Friday 6th March) I idly wondered if I could manage to not eat dairy, meat or fish for a week - well, that felt good and manageable, so it became a month and now I'm a year in. Thought I should share my experiences in case anybody wants to hear it

weight - I lost it, I'm about 6'2 and weighed around 81kg (I didn't regularly weigh myself before going vegan) - summer last year I'd sometimes be as little as 73 kg (but I think that's cos sometimes in the summer you feel you don't need to eat much). I've settled at about 75kg and I'm still eating an awful lot while doing hardly any exercise

Muscle definition is better, more pronounced, I nearly have abs, waist goes in more, though I think I'm still using the same hole on my belt

Skin - far better, old marks (not scars, but just things that are about orange or purpley which have appeared without reason at some time or another on my skin, are fading or have faded completely. Mosquito bites seem to heal more quickly too. 

Skin on body is also somehow softer/ smoother - tricky one to describe

skin on face - basically no breakouts now (fingers crossed) . I was certainly still annoying getting spots now and then despite being well past my teenage years, but now my skin is clear, though wearing a mask all day a lot of the time cos of covid often dries out the skin just to the side of my nose, but then we'll have half term (I'm a teacher) and I wear masks way less and it's clear that's just down to the masks

Last time, in the 6 month update I wrote about possibly being less wrinkly, dunno about that

face is definitely leaner though, cheekbones more pronounced

nose is less stuffy/ blocked - used to be I would put those strips on my nose to keep the nostrils open while I slept, now I don't need them

Think I'm sleeping better

Think possibly, I'm recovering faster when I do go for a run (my main form of exercises). I haven't been running regularly recently, but when I have I feel like that soreness I'd sometimes get in my thighs - Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness is the name I think, is lesser than I might expect. It seems that plant-based athletes recover more quickly and can train more as a result - I'm hardly an example of this but did think I should say. About a month ago I managed to run 12k on Saturday morning and then 10 on the Sunday  - not sure I've done that much on successive days since Jan 2018 (I'd done a marathon in 2017 and wanted to better my time, but ended up injuring myself). My usual run ( is 5-8 km), Wasn't particularly sore afterwards after that weekend either

My nails are growing more quickly, I'm basically wolverine

people talk about having more energy - I don't know about that, I've always had loads of energy from first thing in the morning onwards (once was nicknamed the duracell bunny)

Possibly TMI stuff - so feel free to avoid

BO - dramatically reduced, to the degree that I don't bother with deodorant any more (before I used to use one of those deo blocks from lush). I don't work in construction or a really physical job or anything, but it does get hot obviously here in Italy, and even after i go running or whatever my tee-shirts and my armpits don't smell too bad

Digestion - I've never had a problem with constipation, always attributing this to plenty of exercise and fruit, but shall we say, I have even less of a problem now. Perhaps I used to make 1 or 2 ""sitting visits"" to the bathroom every day, now it's more like 3 or 4 - suppose I might be spending more on toilet paper - is this why being vegan is generally thought to be so expensive? For the first few days though, digestion was interesting, I didn't have diarrhoea or anything, but ready access to a toilet was useful, luckily I was working from home - it even came out green a few times

Erections - feel like they're harder, perhaps last longer and perhaps that my ""recovery time"" is less. Used to be, after I came that'd be it for that session and the little guy was having a rest for a few hours, but lately, I reckon round 2 might be on the cards. Also, I did wonder, months back, whether I'd gotten slightly bigger when hard, than usual, not so that anyone else would notice, it's not like I gained inches, but it felt slightly different in my hand - could just be that that's because it's harder, or maybe I really did gain something (in girth). This doesn't really matter, it could all be in my head (I typed hand there accidentally lol) it's not about to affect my relationship, the difference, if there is one, is minimal, but wanted to put it out there. Dunno if my cum tastes better, sorry. 

end of the TMI

Think eating plant-based has helped me with a long-term injury, I got illiotibial band syndrome in Jan 2018 and since then have alternately rested and down lots of stretching and exercises to strengthen and heal it, and sometimes run, while takign care to try to not to worsen it. It seems almost healed now (plant foods should have helped with inflammation in theory) - trouble is I complicated it on one of my occasional runs (before going plant-based) and managed to give myself hip bursitis/ trochanteritis - though this is also getting better, and I also attribute it's getting better partly to Time, the great healer, and partly to my diet. 

Honestly, I don't see myself eating meat, fish or dairy again, I'm really happy with my diet, and as time goes on, and now I find the animals rights and environmental reasons equally compelling. My friends and family know I'm vegan, and I've been encouraging them to try it, colleagues at work know and gently take the piss, but they can see that I'm the healthiest person there I mean, I prob was before too, so for me that makes it more compelling - I didn't have too much spare weight on me as far as I was concerned, or any worrying health problems, but all these unexpected benefits happened. At the same time as safeguarding my future health, I'm able to advocate for animal rights and be more environmentally friendly.

Some resources I've found really helpful are Mic the vegan on youtube

Michael Greger's how not to die book, and his website nutritionfacts

plant-based news on youtube is good too

The latest documentary I watched was “Seepiracy” on Netflix, and it was just hard to watch.

Maybe it’s not much but I understand that every little step counts. So “I don’t want to be attached to that industry” anymore. 

So, my petition is as follows:

I don't even really like plant based imitation meat if it's *too* close to the real thing because it weirds me out. But I do understand not everyone feels the same, and it is potentially very important as either a gateway or a means for the wider population to go vegan.

So I was thinking about this and I realised that I don't know enough about the potential environmental impact. Lab grown meat *should* be at least a little more efficient, surely? There's always going to be some kind of inefficiency in converting plant matter into animal matter, but animals also do all sorts of crazy things that farmers deem unnecessary like moving or having any quality of life.

This list of crucial nutrients for vegans are made for europeans. Selenium for example is no problem for people who are living in places with selenium rich soils like canada or huge parts of the US. I also wrote down how I recommend getting these nutrients. 

Very Very Crucial:
- Vitamin B12 (supplement)

Very Crucial:
- Vitamin D (not just for vegans; people who don't live in sunny areas of the World should supplement it)
- Iodine (also depends on your location; i recommend a supplement since the Iodine content in algae is hugely varying)
- DHA (seeds with high ALA contents like flax, chia or hemp, if you are worried about your conversion rate, better supplement it together if EPA)

Crucial:
- zinc (legumes, pumpkin/sunflower/chiaseeds, some nuts etc.)
- EPA (Same as DHA, but less crucial, because ALA is converted easier into EPA than into DPA)
- selenium (this depends on your local soil, I recommend a supplement, because the selenium content of brazil nut are hugely varying)

Less crucial:
- iron (seeds, dried apricots, oat, legumes, etc.)
- vitamin B2 (found in small parts in many foods, so it should add up even if you never thought about your B2 intake, very good sources are mushrooms and almonds)
- calcium (plant Milk with extra calcium, greens, many other vegetables, nuts, mineral water, etc.)
- vitamin K2 (can be converted from K1, best source is kale) 

Not really crucial, but worth mentioning:
- protein (legumes, whole grains, nuts, seeds, etc)
- lysine (most crucial amino acid for vegans and one of the many reasons you should eat your legumes every day, some seeds also have huge amounts)
- energy (you should consider eating more, since vegan foods tend to have a lower calorie density)

Also notice that Vitamin A is easy to get from conversation from beta carotene, but some people (I think one in 10.000, but idk the exact number) can't convert beta carotene properly, these people should consider eating more carots, sweet potatoes and pumpkins or taking a retinol supplement.

I feel crazy. I’m having difficulty coping, and I need a safe place to express my thoughts. 

For five days, I’ve been obsessively following the animals that are being left to die in the Suez Canal. The thought of the heat, the excruciating discomfort, thirst, and hunger, standing in their own feces... I’m a wreck. If an article pops up and I read it, I have the urge to smash my phone on the wall. I’m furious this is happening and that there’s nothing I can do. I can’t find a way to help, a way to donate. I know they are going to their death either way, but slaughter is less cruel than starvation and high heat. Any time I see stories like this, like when pigs were being inhumanely killed en masse during the pandemic because demand for bacon went down, or when I watch a documentary on the livestock industry, I’m a wreck. Which is a problem, because part of my job for 5 years has been to teach students about animal agriculture. I cry every day after school during that unit. I’ve been vegan for over ten years. I help run a farm sanctuary that someone else started. I can’t do anything else. I’ve sunk all my money and time into helping these animals. I left my first job because I couldn’t stomach animal testing and the dead beagles I’d pass every day in the freezer, even if I wasn’t directly involved. Knowing there were puppies who would spend their short lives in a cage being fed research chemicals right next to my lab left me suicidal.  I couldn’t do anything. I couldn’t save them. I couldn’t even go in to look at them.  There’s so much unnecessary, human-inflicted suffering in the world, and I have a hard time keeping a level head about it. I know it’s not helpful. But I hate not being able to help. Sometimes I feel like if I suffer with them, if I starve, if withhold water from myself, maybe I’ll feel less worthless. But that’s mental illness. I don’t know how to cope. How do you cope? How do you watch the videos and keep up with the news? I used to slaughter pigs before I started rescuing them. I was a different person. I don’t know how I did that, and I can never forgive myself. Every day I feel like I deserve to die. I’m powerless. I’m part of the problem.  I don’t know what to do.

\- Kashi's Sicilian veggie pizza. This one came out before its time, and now that plant-based and non-dairy stuff has grown more popular, I think it would be a huge hit. You can tell it came out 10+ years ago, because all the online reviews about it are just omnivore dorks complaining that it doesn't have cheese.

\- Dark chocolate chunk Luna bars. I don't know how the hell these got discontinued! They were delicious! 

\- Original Tings. The quality of these was really hit-or-miss. Some bags were way, way underseasoned, but the good bags were so good that they made you forget your disappointment. I have been trying to find a replacement for these with no success so far.

There are many more that I can't think of at the moment.

And the man (Gojira's singer and frontman) talks about why he went vegan, explaining how the animal food industry actually works and, frankly, it struck me. I already knew the way in which the cow is made to produce milk (by getting her pregnant and taking the calf out of her when it is born), and I really feel guilty for having been involved in all of this. Inside me I feel the moral need to have to change to be less and less complicit in these activities but I'm afraid of failing miserably. Right now I eat meat 2-3 times a week and animal products are like 90% of my diet and honestly I find it hard for me to stop consuming all of that. So I ask you: how did you do it? Did you remove everything overnight or did you opt for a slower transition? I would be forced to take supplements or are there any surrogates for those nutrients present in animal food/products? How much would it affect the environment if I stopped eating meat and other animal products?

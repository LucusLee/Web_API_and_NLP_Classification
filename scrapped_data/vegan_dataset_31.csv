As a vegan and animal lover, I also... don't hate zoos. I follow a lot of vegan pages on instagram, watch vegan youtubers and over and over I see nothing but hate for zoos. Saying they should all be closed, and that everyone who visits one should be cancelled etc. Usually attached to some old photos from third world country zoos with animals living in horrible conditions. 

My belief is that in an ideal world, zoo's wouldn't exist and every animal would live freely in it's natural habitat. But sadly, we don't live in an ideal world, we live in a world filled with pollution, habitat destruction, hunting, mass scale farming, over-fishing destroying the oceans. And in this world zoo's sadly are vital for the care of wild animals. 

I work in this industry, and see it all from the inside, so I find it upsetting when some vegans are so quick to judge and so short-sighted on zoos. I work in a small town wildlife sanctuary. At this sanctuary yes, we do have animals on display that are captive animals and can't be released to the wild. And yes we charge people tickets to enter because that's the only funding we get. But behind the scenes we have a hospital where we rescue, rehab and release wild animals. Hundreds per year, who never see the public and have limited contact with humans. 

And what do we do when we get a case we can't handle? We take it to the zoo. We are a small establishment with limited facilities, but we have a good relationship with the local zoo which has an amazing big animal hospital.

We get everything from pelicans with fishing wire down their throats to wombats who have been hit by a car. But one thing is consistent to almost all of our rescues, and that is that they are needing to be rescued because of interference from humans in one way or another. We caused the problem, so we feel the need to help fix it. Also, my sanctuary is almost entirely volunteer run. We work long hours, mostly outdoors in all sorts of weather for zero pay, just because we are passionate about helping animals. 

I also recently visited another much larger wildlife sanctuary in a different state, which had about 200-300 animals on display, but in 2020 alone they rescued, rehabed then released 14,000 wild animals. Just in one year! And the truth about this is that no one else can really do this but zoos. People take injured native wildlife to vets, but vets rarely know how to treat animals outside of cats and dogs, and they usually just sit in a cage until they can be transferred to a zoo or specialised wildlife carer. 

Between breeding programs of endangered animals, to all the rescue work with zoo hospitals, to the extensive conservation work done worldwide to help ensure the future of wildlife etc zoos are now vital to our world if you like animals. I see this all from inside the industry so it's kind of frustrating to see vegans pointing to things like Tiger King or third world zoos' or other horrible, abusive attractions and using those to say all zoos are evil and should be closed. If all zoo's closed overnight it would be devastating for the world's wild animals. It's the sad truth. Zoo's aren't all made equal. Worldwide yes, there are some horrific, sad, abusive zoo's and wildlife ""Attractions"" that I wish would close as much as anyone, but that shouldn't diminish the good amazing zoos and the people who work at them.

After we got off the boat and took a stroll around the dock, I saw some men ""scaling"" fish with the back of a knife. It was a violent scraping, and scales were flying in the air. But the fish were still alive during the process, they were wildly flopping around on the workbench as the men tried to hold them down. As a little kid seeing this, I was utterly distraught and it literally traumatized me to some degree. The memory and the sheer callousness of it is still etched into my mind. 

A few years later when I was around 8, my mom had gone grocery shopping and prepared a dinner for the family. When she called me to the table, there was a rack of lamb sitting on a platter. Seeing the little ribcage on our table like that, is when the connection between the animal and my food suddenly became really salient. It wasn't food, it was part of a corpse. I remember being horrified, protesting to my parents about it, storming to my room crying. I knew how precious lambs were and would have done anything to protect them. Since then I had an aversion to any type of meat with visible bones in it. 

(Sidenote: My grandpa had a flock of sheep, and in the springtime I'd get to go and play with the lambs. Years later I would find out that he'd always choose the ""juiciest"" one to be butchered. And then we'd eat its flesh during Christmas dinners and other holidays. None of my family bothered to tell me where the meat came from.)

There are countless more examples. As a kid I saw animals frantically pacing back and forth in tiny zoo enclosures, watched lobsters get chucked into boiling pots of water, etc. I've always found it absolutely horrendous, yet I still didn't go vegan until I was 17.

When I was young I thought vegans were crazy and I remember joking around with my brother about those protein-deficient and opinion-forcing plant eaters. I knew about the facts of the inhumane circumstances of lifestock farming and the outrageous consequences for our enviroment, but never reflected on them.

This all changed when I was 13 in early 2016, I was eating my favourite dish - spaghetti bolognese - when I scrolled through the trending YouTube videos and a video called ""Fleischkonsum zerstört unseren Planeten"" (meat consumption destroys our planet) by the german vegan ""influencer"" Luna Darko came into my sight, she would influence me pretty much in the following year on what person I want to be in the future, she seemed pretty smart and empathic, and often talked about self-love, self discovery, feminism etc. (sadly she deleted this video and distanced herself from the label 'vegan' last year). At this time I was very open and interested in enviromental topics, so I clicked on this video, I remember listening to what she had to say, she sounded very calm, polite and friendly, but you could also tell that this was a very important topic to her, she talked mostly about the eniviroment, but also about the connections to starvation, deseases and health issues and ethics, I remember when she said ""I know this might be the least convincing point for most people, which I think is very sad, cause we should care about this, but a pig has the same cognitive capability as a 3 year old human"", but for me it was one of the most convincing points, beside those about the complex social structures and emotions of cows and chickens. In the following days I gave frequent thoughts on this matter and decided that I want to be vegan myself someday - but not now. My father cooked much meat at this time and I don't wanted the social stigma of a male vegan.

For some reason I didn't even made a first step in the following years, but I knew that becoming vegan was the only right thing to do. I informed myself further on this topic and often argued in favor of veganism, but when a dairy or meat product was on my plate I forgot about it. I devoloped a hobby in cooking in 2017 and became the chef of what I eat, I reduced my flesh consumption, but still ate much of it.

This changed in March 2020 when my school stopped because of a global zoonotic pandemic and I decided to make the first step and got veggie. I knew that this wasn't enough and that I still wanted to be vegan someday, but I loved cheese, which of course I knew isn't a proper reason to eat it, but nevertheless I still ate it. My father, with whom I live with, was very supportive, beside often making stupid jokes and statements.

I became very interested in health topics, and started practising and eating more vegetables, fruits, legumes and whole grains. I read many books and articles and nearly became obsessed with nutrition, so I discovered Niko Rittenau (german vegan nutritionist) and Dr. Michael Greger and read their books ""Vegan-Klischee ade"" (maybe the best book on nutrition, critical nutrients and debunking nutrition based stereotypes about veganism, sadly it's only available in german) and ""How not to die"", which had many shocking facts in it. So I decided to finally go vegan on my 1st anniversary of becoming vegetarian.

It's been one week and it's a miracle - There were 2/3 days in which I craved for cheese, but now, I don't even miss it anymore, despite our fridge being full of it. I am very happy that I'm finally vegan and regret that I haven't done it sooner.

The problem I find with most people is that they truly have no exposure to vegan meals or ideology. That’s why so many people think food is only a meal if it has meat. And why they think that vegans are hippies.

Supporting a gradual change will at very least introduce new options for meals, leading to less death, and at best will make the future change much easier.

Maybe most of you agree, and it’s only the most vocal and public activists that support this kind of thinking (if so, should we change that?), or maybe I’m wrong, let me know what you think!

First, my brief background is that I’ve been a musician for about 20 years and I’ve been *mostly* vegan for about 2 months. Lifestyle changes take work and time, so please forgive me for the “mostly” qualifier. I’m sure you all understand. 🙂

Anyhow, I immediately (within a day or two) started noticing measurable and subjective improvements in my health. My resting heart rate has lowered from 72 to 56 on average - holy smokes! My wedding ring is also looser. And that brings me to the subjective part. 

It’s fairly well known that a plant based diet lowers inflammation throughout the entire body as compared to a, for lack of a better term, “typical American diet.” But what I didn’t expect was that this would directly transfer to my ability to play my instrument. 

I’m a percussionist, which is basically a pompous high-brow term for drummer (badum-tschhh). When it comes to almost any instrument, a lot boils down to your technique, which determines your energy output and physical stress on soft tissue and joints. Well, in my case, my muscles have been able to fly through music and exercises as if I were 10 years younger, which was actually my peak physical condition. I get less tired, I’m less sore, and I recover much faster. My muscles aren’t are swollen after intense playing and I’m ready to go in less than half the recovery time. 

It’s insane. 

I wanted to share this because it has boosted my mood beyond anything I ever expected. I’m finally jazzed (😏) about drumming again after a 2 year hiatus due to various reasons. I didn’t think an unrelated lifestyle change would make such a huge impact, but it really did. 

Also related, my wife is also a musician (flutist) and she has reported a similar experience. 

I’ve been skeptical my whole life about vegan/plant-based diet/lifestyle. I really wish I tried this sooner. I just feel so much better overall. A boost toward getting back into my passion is seriously heart warming, too.",True,False,False,vegan,t5_2qhpm,583520,public,self,,,Any musicians in here?

Just wanted a place to put this out there. Long story short, been keto before and successfully lost 30 lbs. had a baby and gained it all back, and then some. I’ve been off and on since a couple months post-partum and have just been too stressed/overwhelmed/exhausted for it to stick. Little one is almost 10 months and although teething is *killing* us right now, we’re in a decent spot. Given this, I hopped back on this past Monday and have been successful again. Lost about 5 lbs, feeling in control with only a few hard moments that I ultimately defeated. 

However, in one night I gained 3 lbs and I believe this is due to lack of sleep. I fasted until lunch, was within macros, barely over calories, was done eating by 6:45 and had a good 40 minute walk. When all of those things line up, I can expect to lose *something* based on all of my experience. Even if it’s .5 lbs. it’s something. 

Well. I gained 3.2 lbs and I can guarantee you it’s because I slept on the couch last night and got just about zero sleep. My baby girl had a rough night and when that’s the case AND my husband is home (he works nights) I will go to the couch. This is because he’s up most of the night because his own sleep is completely jacked due to work and he can’t stand to hear her cry. To honestly make it easier for everyone, I go to the living room and close the door so he can’t hear her and I don’t feel pressure to go against the sleep training I’ve successfully done with her. 

Most of the time, I don’t have that much trouble getting some sleep but last night I just couldn’t get right. Maybe some other factors contributed to the gain, but I believe this to be the biggest factor. It’s crazy how it can effect it so greatly.

In the past decade, weight loss formulas have come to dominate the supplement market, which is worth billions of dollars globally. The United States is generally considered the biggest consumer of weight loss supplements, but much of the world harbors love for supplementation. At its core, the appeal of a weight loss pill is easy to understand. Taking a supplement can help to maximize the effectiveness of your existing weight loss routine.

Regardless of how much (or how little) you exercise, it’s always possible to improve the efficiency of your workouts and fat-burning routine. The basic outline for any weight loss process should be the creation of a caloric deficit. People who burn more calories throughout the day than they consume are bound to lose weight; this is a guarantee. However, metabolism varies from person to person. Some people seem like they can just eat all day long and never gain weight. Others just look at a piece of cake and seem to gain five pounds.

While popular media outlets may brand all weight loss supplements as scams. While we do realize that many consumers have had bad experiences in this explosive contemporary sector, some weight loss formulas are packed with efficient ingredients capable of supercharging your weight loss work. The Okinawa Flat Belly Tonic is part of this tradition; the supplement claims that it can help people of all ages and weights regain control of their diets.

The formula’s powerful ingredients have been scientifically shown to help people lose more weight. Utilizing GMP, or Good Manufacturing Practices, the company behind the Okinawa Flat Belly Tonic claims that they specially craft each bottle of their supplement for maximum effectiveness.

Figured my weight had some role in that so I started looking into keto after a niece had some success with it. I have a job that keeps me in the car most of the day and was eating fast food almost every day.  I had no idea my current weight because my wife's bathroom scale wouldn't go that high. Was guessing I was around 325-330. Started researching the diet, read the FAQ, tried a few recipes, and ordered a new scale. It arrived on the evening of 12/28. I weighed myself after dinner (I know) and was surprised to see I was 350.6 lbs! Yes, I needed to lose weight. 

I officially started keto on 1/1/21 at 343.4lbs. I initially bought way too much food because I wasn't yet sure how much I'd eat on a given day. I know the recommendation is to do a 20% deficit, but I went with 35% and have maintained that throughout. That gives me a low fat macro and about 1500 calories per day (now). That's a big step down from before when I'd sometimes have 4000 calories in one meal (I'm not kidding).  I started with simple meals. Eventually tried a few recipes - some I liked and some I didn't. I've now gotten into a pretty good routine and vary my dinners through different meats and veggies while keeping brunch about the same each day. 

I've had a few week-long stalls along the way. I don't eat out hardly at all anymore and when I do it usually leads to a slight weight gain despite reading menu nutrition charts and keeping my numbers down. After one fairly long stall I decided to try a fast (only water) - 11pm Sunday to 2pm Tuesday - and that helped a lot to get it started again. 

On 4/1 I weighed 291 lbs! No April Fools there! If I can keep up the 15-lb/mo loss rate, then I'll be at my initial goal of 210 by Halloween. According to the height/weight charts, my ideal weight is about 180 lbs. Not sure if that's doable or desired, but I'll decide when I get close to the first goal. 

For a long time I made excuses that dieting cost too much because healthy food costs more than unhealthy food and I'm not wealthy. It's cheaper to buy a pack of hot dogs and a box of mac n cheese than broccoli and chicken. Well, that's true, but I've found I have more money in the bank now than I did then. I might go spend $150 at the grocery store (usually less) but then I feed myself two meals per day for two weeks or more. Compare that to a $15 (or more) every day in the drive thru (for one meal) in the same timeframe at $210+.

I've finally convinced my wife to try it as she's been wanting to lose some weight (5'0"" at 127 lbs) and she started on 4/1 at a 20% deficit. She committed to 30 under 20 for now, then she'll decide if she wants to continue. She's a big bread, chocolate, and milk fan so I'm finding some subs for her.

Anyhoo... I'm pleased with the progress so far. I've gone down 2 pants sizes and am close to going down another. Had to buy a new belt. My seatbelt isn't as tight as it used to be.

I started at 265 pounds, eating probably close to 3000 calories a day, if not more. Even back in my college athletics days (I was a rower for a D1 club team) my relationship with food, to put it lightly, was a coping mechanism.

Feeling sad? Eat.

Feeling depressed? Eat.

Bored? Eat.

It wasn't healthy, and I knew I needed to change something.

So after doing a lot of research, I determined keto was the best fit for me, and even though it's recommended to ""slowly transition"" in, I just went full-in. I count my macros and weigh food out, and at the beginning, it was hard fighting the urges to cheat. But I didn't give in, and as time went on, the cravings went away. I started walking more, and just getting outside in general. 

And after over a month, I realized something: I don't need to eat to feel better, or just because I'm bored. I need to eat when I'm hungry to live, and yea I can snack from time to time, but food is for sustenance, not something to pass the time. And in that epiphany, I realized why keto works for me: it cut out my cravings and made me feel fuller, longer. It made me genuinely take stock of what I eat, and get smarter about what I'm putting in my body. 

My goal is 200, and as of today I'm down to 238, but what impresses me the most is not that weight loss, it's that keto has made my relationship with food into a healthy one!

Start with 1 tablespoon either when you're aweke with around 300ml or more water. Or have it before you go to bed.

I’m 5 days into keto and I’m wondering if I should go by total carbs or net carbs?

I’ve noticed a lot of keto specific specialty foods like protein bars, gummies, bread etc will have like 12-14g total carbs and like 2g net carbs

If my target is 50g carbs is it net 50 carbs or 50 total carbs, and do I need to care about soluble/insoluble fibers when measuring?

I think ideally 50g net carbs would be best but I wanna make sure I do this properly.

Another thing should I purchase exogenous ketones to consume before working out / electrolytes etc I wanna make sure I’m all balanced out

My goals are to slim down and lose weight but not at a large expense of muscle loss. I am thinking about trying out fasting 24 or 36 simply because I am not feeling any inch of hunger(currently on hour 17 and feel great). I do still lift frequently, but as of right now only free weights and being active from work because of relocation.

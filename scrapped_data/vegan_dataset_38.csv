But before that cereal I had essentially done nothing special concerning iron since I became vegan in June 2017.

The fact that iron absorption is coupled so closely with your blood Vitamin C level is - I think - a key indicator of just how fundamentally important it is to be eating a wide range of plant foods. There is no Vitamin C in traditional American meat products. The Inuit use raw seal brain for Vitamin C sometimes, so there's that.

For example, I was scrolling through reddit before bed last night, and I happened upon an extremely triggering image of animal abuse untagged in my front page. While I understand that this was not done as a prank or something but rather to spread awareness (and while there were comments suggesting it may be fake or out of context), this image was extremely graphic and immediately sent me into a panic attack, because it was so sudden and unexpected. I then spent the next few hours trying desperately to calm myself down, because while a panic attack itself doesn't last super long, the after effects do. 

This is just one specific and severe example. but I just feel like the constant discussion of animal abuse chips away at me mentally and emotionally. I makes me feel burnt out, and it makes me dread interacting with others.  I feel as though I don't have any friends anyways, and especially not vegan ones, so I feel extremely isolated.

I also just..dread having discussions about it with my family, because the people around me are the kind of people who literally will never get it (we are talking narcissistic family members). I feel like my home life plays into a lot of my mental state, but I feel like as well that I get burnt out easily from everything, especially because everything feels so fucked up and horrible. It feeds into my anxiety and depression, and while I watch everyone boast about how their mental state is only improving, I feel like in a way mine is deteriorating. Its a big reason why I haven't watched Dominion yet. I feel concerned that I'm in such a terrible headspace that it will only cause a more serious issue.

I want to stress that I don't think that eating vegan or refusing to consume animal product is causing this. I truly believe that my awareness is just another layer of the amount of shit that's gone wrong that I see every day.

Warning: This post contains descriptions of animal deaths.

**TLDR:** Someone's pet snake died before he could feed the snake a mouse. Now he doesn't know what to do with the mouse. If it becomes inevitable that he gets another snake, would it be preferable to rescue the little fella or to allow him to become the new snake's meal in place of a poor future mouse whose sale would benefit a scumbag rodent breeder?

**Full Post:**

I will first mention that I am a vegan of seven years and personally averse to rescuing obligate carnivores as long as humans are unable to supplant their diet with adequate alternatives to animal meat on a consistent basis. Until lab-cultured options are available, relying on roadkill or meat from animals culled by legal mandates leaves too much suffering to chance, and I would like to provide as little consumer demand as possible to industries that exploit animals. 

I have an uncomfortable scenario at hand. Until recently, someone I know would feed mice to a snake he kept as a pet. He kept one mouse at a time between feedings. Before the most recently purchased mouse could be delivered as a meal, the snake passed away. 

The former snake owner lives about 1000 miles away from me and does not want the mouse. He accepted my instinctive offer to find someone to adopt him. Unfortunately, he plans to adopt another snake to whom he will almost certainly feed mice. 

On one hand, I could save this mouse and feel good about having kept one innocent animal from being killed. On the other hand, I would probably only be swapping the life of this mouse for that of another one the human would buy from a rodent breeder, which would profit the mouse seller and create demand for his business. Should I save one mouse now at the expense of another later, or do I let him become food for the next snake in order to both save a future mouse from such a fate and avoid creating an incentive for this person to support the breeder in the future? 

Please pardon the jumble. This is keeping me up and my heart and my brain are at odds.

We currently live on the big island of Hawaii, and had just spent a wonderful day exploring since the place that did his shot was almost 2 hours away on the other side of the island. 

We tried a trendy, vegetarian restaurant that put honey mustard on the salad that we were going to share even though we specifically requested that it be made vegan and they assured us that that wouldn't be a problem. I didn't want to contribute more to the food waste problem though, so my husband, who is not vegan, decided that he would eat the salad. I decided not to let that get me down though and just enjoyed the rest of the food we ordered which was all very good.

Later we drove around a bit looking at some of the local shops and sights including a gorgeous waterfall, and then we headed home, by the time we got back to our side of the island, my husband was feeling hungry again, so he suggested that we pick up some food at panda express, which is not certified vegan due to cross contamination, I know, but does have the eggplant tofu and chow mein which are made with plant-based recipes, so I'm personally okay with eating there.

As we approach the restaurant though, my husband, who normally pays, gets a call from his mom, and asks me to go get the food, so he can take the call. Without thinking, I say, ""sure, what do you want?"", and I'm immediately overcome with dread because I realize that he's going to ask me to get him the teriyaki chicken and walnut shrimp, and then I start having a panic attack.

My husband, who picked up the call before he realized I was freaking out, told his mom that he would call her back later and ended the call quickly. He then asked if I was okay and if we still wanted to get food. I told him that I wasn't really hungry, and we drove home. We ended up skipping dinner altogether, and we haven't really talked about what happened.

I think the reason I started freaking out is because I had always had a degree of separation between his eating habits and my responsibility for them, but when he asked me to pick up (and thus pay for) his food. It was like I would be accepting personal responsibility for it. 

And while I don't believe that his choices are wholly my responsibility, I'm concerned that I haven't done enough to try to convince him to change, and I feel like I've been selfishly avoiding that conversation with him because it will be awkward and uncomfortable.

Despite our vet’s efforts, Bolota’s body was too old, and too damaged by selective breeding, and he ended up dying. So we all got together, held a funeral, and took his body in a procession into the wild plateau, where we left it to be eaten by the wolves.

I’ve been vegan for almost 3 years. My family (mom, sister, and brother-in-law) were supportive at first but basically in the sense that they thought I had found a new hobby. As time has gone on, I have tried to talk to them about the realities of animal agriculture and the immense suffering. (They all call themselves animal lovers btw.) I’ve shared articles and videos, etc. and now it’s to the point where they ignore me. I don’t feel like I have bombarded them with information. I will share something once a month or so. But about 6 weeks ago, I shared an article about pig farming via group text and my sister hasn’t contacted me since, even though I’ve reached out to her several times since then about completely unrelated, benign topics. Last week mom agreed to watch Dominion with me. Before we started it, she went on and on for about 15 minutes about a stray cat she had taken to an animal shelter recently and about how she was appalled that the shelter released the cat back into the neighborhood several days later (in 20 degree weather) to fend for himself, because they said the cat most likely belonged to someone in the neighborhood and in their experience, this was the best way for the cat to make his way back home. This horrified me too, that an animal shelter would deal with an animal this way, but that’s not my point. My point is that after this discussion about the cat (and how disgusted she was with their handling of the cat), my mom and I proceeded to watch Dominion. She didn’t bat an eye. She wasn’t bothered or disturbed at all by the sheer terror and fear that was evident in the animals’ eyes and faces and the horrible suffering that way shown. She actually started to doze off in the middle of it but I woke her up. I’ll bet if I were to ask her right now what she learned about the dairy industry from that film, she wouldn’t be able to tell me anything. She told me before we watched it that it wasn’t going to change her mind. I asked her to just please watch and listen with an open mind and be willing to learn something. I think she just tuned it out and didn’t listen to any of the narrative and assumed that the footage she was seeing was from isolated cases, not the norm. I love my family but I’m having an extremely hard time dealing with the hypocrisy and the blatant unwillingness to learn how their food ends up on their plate.  It’s definitely causing a rift but I don’t know how to be ok with it. I tell them what I have learned and they just don’t care. If it were about any other topic or injustice, they would be receptive. They just literally refuse to discuss this with me or learn anything. I can’t stand it. It’s like, if you know me and love me and are close to me, then be open to what I’m trying to share with you and show you about what I’ve learned about the horrors of animal agriculture. I feel like they would rather cling to their “right” to eat animal products than to take me seriously. This doesn’t make me want to stay in contact with them. We were so close before; why won’t they trust that maybe what I’m trying to share with them is real? If I’ve learned something that upsets me extremely, why won’t they take me seriously and consider that there might be something to what I’m saying?

About four years ago, one of our family members was diagnosed with an illness; instead of resorting to incorporating the prescribed medication for a lifetime, we decided to go vegan as a family to help support the transition to heal with food, as opposed to medication. Within the first few months, contrary to the medical advice received at the time, all signs of the illness disappeared, and our family fully adopted the vegan lifestyle for health purposes ever since.

As the years went by, many other aspects of our lives changed. Naturally, we began to become more aware of the products we were using and their impact on our bodies as well as the environment, but one of the biggest impacts adopting a vegan lifestyle has had for me personally, was the dissolution of the concept that we, as a species, are superior to others.

Driving home on the highway the other afternoon, a duck was sitting on the asphalt road just about a foot away from the median. As cars drove by, the drivers would move over and continue their journey. The highway was two lanes, one way with a 50 MPH speed limit. There was a man-made river with a pond about a quarter mile away where the ducks spend their time; I pulled over to see if I could help take her to safety.

I approached the duck and put my hand out to let her know I was there to help. One of her feet sticking out, but I couldn’t see any other signs of injury. She let me pick her up without any fear. I carried her to the pond and placed her beside the water, to let her decide whether she wanted to swim or rest.

I sat down next to her and spent about 20 minutes by her side until her eyes started to relax and her head slowly doze off; as I began to realize what was happening I sang her a song about the graceful life she must have lived at the pond. I sang until she passed, and immediately broke down in tears. I found so much relief in knowing this small act of compassion allowed her to spend the remainder of her time at home, beside the lake, under the shade and in the company of her family as opposed to a hot asphalt road with massive machines roaring by her every moment, until her last moment.

Being vegan has had many positive impacts on my life, but more than anything I am grateful for having been gifted the clarity to understand the vast amount of similarities we share with all other forms of life, to embrace the connection to our planet, its landscape and all of its inhabitants – we are all one and the same

Almonds, and a lot of other staples of my diet, use managed pollination as a means to pollinate the vast amount crops being farmed. The same bees being used to harvest honey are transported huge distances in near starvation and trapped within their own hives to pollinate the foods we eat.

I'm genuinely curious to hear other people's thoughts on this, because this is a huge moral quandary for me.

Now, it's of course no one's *job* to recall this fact about me. (I'm not *that* important, alas.) I can use my words to inform people who need to know. 

But having to remind the same people over and over again is annoying, and sometimes invalidating.  

If my friend or family member were allergic to nuts, they would not have to tell me twice, and I would not subject them to nuts. If they were undergoing a spiritual fast, I would avoid talking about and eating food around them. 

Given the uncontested importance of such things, it seems only decent--but again, not obligatory--to know these things. It doesn't take up that much mental real estate. 

Sometimes, when non-vegan people who know me fairly well say this to me, it sounds awfully disingenuous--as disingenuous as it would sound to them if I said to them, say, ""Sorry, I forgot you ate meat."" 

(By the way, the same people tend to feel annoyed when you tell them you're vegan--as if remembering that fact wouldn't circumvent that.)

I'm speculating here, but sometimes I can't help but think the aim is delegitimize a lifestyle commitment by deeming it utterly forgettable. 

Then again, some people just have bad memories. In which case, fair enough.

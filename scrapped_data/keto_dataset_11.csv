**First of all, I'm not against this lifestyle and I'm actually proud of those who are sticking with it.**

I tried keto first time in august 2020. It lasted 2 weeks because I went to an event where I had some high carb meal and yeah... Btw, I had no flu during those 2 weeks, only some insomnia the first 3 days then I slept like a baby.

Yesterday I tried again: I had some chicken breast, avocado and eggs at lunch and then, 8 hours later at night I was sick af. Terrible headache (nape included) and this urge to vomit. I was full of sweating and in the same time I was cold.

In the end I vomited 3 times a yellow liquid and after every vomit I had this bitter flavor in my mouth. I guess it was all from my gall (first time for me btw).

Idk if the amount was a problem and that's why I was sick: I ate at a deficit caloric and I had 500g chicken breast, 300g avocado (6 mini avocados) and 4 eggs. I'd go for more vegetables but I'm scared of carbs.

Now I'm laying in my bed with a headache (but without an urge to vomit or some cold sweating) thinking about what should I do. What do you think? Should I just continue with the same meal or should I eat something ""lighter"" like chicken breast + vegetables only?

First time posting, long time lurker. 
I am very embarrassed to be here asking what appears to be the most common question. 
But here I am...

I have been doing Keto since Dec 1, 2020 and have lost 18 pounds. I am very happy with my progress so far, but after 7 weeks I am completely stuck. My weight has not fluctuated more than two pounds during what I believe to be a plateau. 

My stats are 30(F) 5’10” 159lbs. 
I would like to get down to around 140lbs. 

My macros are 118g fats, 15g net carbs, and 62g protein. 
My TDEE is 1837 approx. 

Prior to these stagnant 7 weeks, I was consuming no more than 1200 calories. 

This is what I have tried:
For two weeks I increased my calorie limit to 1600, and my weight did not change. (This was the last time I saw a difference in my physical measurements) 

The past two weeks, I have been consuming no more than 1000 calories and my weight has not changed. 

I am always around half (or less) for fat consumption, never above my carb limit, but average around 80/90g protein daily. 

I have yet to eat one bite off program. I weigh everything with a scale. 

I do not exercise, but I am a horse trainer and am riding for about 5 hours a day/5 days a week, absolute minimum. I have no idea how to calculate what my expenditure would be so I don’t factor that info in. 
Side note: I have been having a hard time working during these past two weeks with my lowered calorie limit. I am frequently dizzy, even with adding additional sodium and electrolytes. Hoping that will go away soon...

I am very embarrassed to be asking this question, but please help. This is my first attempt at Keto and I intend to give it my all. Am I being overzealous? Any advice is very much appreciated.

Some of my favorites and their net carbs per serving in parentheses:

Pasta Sauce: Rao's Homemade Marinara Sauce (5g, better than most sugary sauces IMO)

Milk: Kroger® CARBmaster® Ultra Filtered Non-Fat Original Milk (3g, I don't like the taste of nut milks and so drink this instead every so often)

Chocolate: Lily's Milk Chocolate Style Salted Caramel Bar (2g, I recommend this whole brand but I enjoy this product specifically)

Sandwich Bread: Outer Aisle Cauliflower Sandwich Thins (2g, this is not ""bread"" but its great for when you want to make a sandwich, can be used for mini pizzas as well)

Ice Cream: (net carbs vary by flavor) I've tried Halo Top, Enlightened, Rebel, and other less known brands. I'd say Rebel is the best, followed by Enlightened, followed by Halo Top. Halo Top to me is more *creamed ice* than ice cream. This is somewhat of a problem with all these brands, but I'd say Halo Top has the worst texture overall.  Enlightened and Rebel are both pretty good, I gave the edge to Rebel due to flavor choices being more to my liking. I am actually going to try making my own ice cream soon which I'm sure will be better than all of these options. Still, these are good to know for when you're lazy.

Frozen Products: 

Costco Frozen Broccoli (2g, Package comes with 4 or so smaller bags of broccoli. Nuke the bag for 5 minutes and season how you like and you have some really good broccoli on demand.

Everyone else seems to have so much less to lose (most want to lose up to 30-45kg (66-100lbs)) and their advice/experience is often so different to mine and doesn't help me as much as I'd like because someone of my size has different issues (physically/mentally/emotionally) to face. It's extremely difficult to explain the differences to them because they just aren't this big and it's usually very small differences so they brush it off as insignificant (it's not to me) and that makes me feel very alienated.

1. How much did you lose and how long did it take you? What type of keto (dirty/strict/lazy/clean) and was it only keto or did you do other things to help along the way?
2. How has maintenance been if you're there? Did you transition to another way of eating? Did things get harder as you approached your goal weight?
3. Do you work out? When did you decide to start working out and for what reasons?
4. When did you start noticing you were actually getting smaller? Specifically in the belly region which is so far the least changed part of me measurement wise.
5. Is there anything you wished you knew when you started that would have made things easier for you to lose weight or keep it off? 
6. What was your biggest struggle? How did you face plateaus and days where you just felt like it was impossible to get to/be your goal? I don't often struggle with this but when I do it's very hard because I don't know many people who have this much to loose, so I can't look to them and say they did it I can too.
7. Did you have insulin resistance and if so did it clear up or are you still watchful? Is there anything health wise I should be watchful for while losing weight?

I started at 225 (I'm 5'9 M), and at the start I was losing weight quite quickly. In the first 15 days, I lost 10 lbs. After that, my weight loss has stalled. I got down to 211 and now haven't lost weight for about 2 weeks. I haven't cheated at all, and I'm doing the exact same thing I was doing at the start. My tests say I'm in ketosis but obviously they aren't 100% . I eat basically the same amount of food every single day. A couple hamburgers with cheese, a hotdog or 2 and a decent sized salad with ham ,boiled egg, cheese with a drizzle of ranch. I calculated how many calories each meal was around 1700 calories (20% deficit). With around 40-50 carbs per day. But I also eat only one meal a day, two if I'm really hungry. 

1.  Do I need to do less carbs per day?

2. Is it better to eat one big meal a day with all of your calories and carbs in that meal (sort of intermittent fast) or have multiple meals a day with obviously less calories and carbs in each meal? 

3. Also, is eating the same exact food every single day bad? Does your body get use to it?

I weighed myself at 220 at the start and at the end only weighed in about 218. There were some times where I didn't know the carb count of some foods and I just ate it hoping it did not knock me off keto like at the last week I ate a dozen wings which had some breading on it.

Well, I (33/F/164cm/SW: 300lbs CW:175lbs) have been on keto since February of 2019... I started at around 300lbs and I have been slowly working my way down.  I think I may be the only person I know who didn't gain weight during the strict quarantine here, but I didn't lose much during those months either to be fair.  I have been going pretty slow, in the last 5 or so months I added in intermittent fasting but generally speaking, I just lose weight slowly and I am OK with that.  I have always weighed a lot, when I am stick thin I weigh 165 pounds, I mean I am happy to lose another 10 pounds give or take but I am not fussed about it.  I am happy with my body where I am at.  I had sort of hoped that losing so slowly and using ample cream (and I mean seriously, I could not be more effing hydrated), would aid in not having so much loose skin, and maybe it did, but not enough... My loose skin is an actual problem.

This is going to be so much TMI, but we're all in the same boat here right?  My loose skin is a hygiene problem.  As we're getting into the warmer months here, I am struggling to keep under the flaps of skin dry, like we’re one hot month away from there being a smell situation.  My belly button is already questionable.  I don’t know how to talk about this with people I know, so I turned to the internet like everyone else does.  I'd like to think that if it were just an aesthetics thing, I would be happier with the situation, but I am honestly not sure how long I would be willing to play Tetris with skin to put on clothes before I considered surgery even without the present hygiene issue.  I know many people who lost more weight than I did and didn’t end up with as much, I suppose everyone is different.  I'm not unhappy with my body per se...  But it's hard to be super excited about losing 100 pounds and buying your first bikini when you have to do a puzzle of how to place your skin inside it every time.

After standing back up, and checking that both halves of my face were still mobile, I realized I had fainted and that it might be time to check on my Blood Pressure meds to see about lowering them.

SO, today I saw my Dr. and we're starting to reduce the meds *(the good NSV)* with the goal of eliminating them in the near future, because I keep getting readings of 100/60 the last few weeks.

While I was there, we discussed that I'm on Keto - she was fine with it, but not a huge fan, but didn't cast any shade on it. We're checking my A1C, Cholesterol (the regular panel), Liver and Kidney function, and I'm pretty sure Potassium\* too. Will update in a couple days with how those turn out.

Also, I wore pants to the doctor that I bought over a year ago, that were ""my size"" but which I couldn't get on, and now they fit great!

Mental energy is at the top, physical energy varies depending on factors. Since I started OMAD at the same time as keto, I rarely ever have any energy when trying to work out. But I realize that my body just needs to adapt. Overall I feel great.

But a few things worry me. First of all, I experience muscle cramps and somewhat of a headache unless I drink salt water every two hours. I bought some electrolyte powder as well with sodium, magnesium, potassium and sodium. I feel really great after taking that stuff, and I feel like I need to take it probably 3 times per day, and I wouldn't say that I'm really that active right now. I know that you urinate a lot on keto and electrolyte imbalances are a pretty common thing, but my question is; 

**1) Do I need to replenish these amounts of electrolytes all the time when I'm on keto, or does my body kind of adapt to it after a few weeks?** I know it doesn't really work that way, but I figure the body must find a system to kind of keep things in needs, and not flush it, right? I mean I must take a lot of electrolytes just to try to prevent my muscles from twitching. And my joints from hurting and getting stiff.

**2) Does the diarrhoea subside when my body gets fat adapted?** At least yesterday, I had to shit water at least 3 times after my meal. I realize that it's a common side effect during the initial stages of ketosis (or during ""keto flu""), but the body adapts to it, right? I've got some probiotic pills at home, which only usually makes me need to shit more and not necessarily make it better, but I can try those. I ate some saurkraut today with my meal and I hope that it makes some difference. I think there were some undigested pieces today too, yellow/dark yellow pieces, circa 0,5 cm/0,2"".

**3) What are the general symptoms of being dehydrated, except for being thirsty?** Can dehydration cause muscle twitches too etc?

**4) How long time does it take before I can get a little bit of physical energy to work out?** I must be very careful right now, a little too much and I just get generally drained. I don't think working out really is a good idea right now, since I might have muscle catabolism if I do so.

**5) Is a high conjugated bilirubin level bad in combination with keto?** I saw on my recent blood test that I had a pretty high conjugated bilirubin level. All the other liver enzyme levels etc were all fine. But is this worries me slightly, since the liver is part of what metabolizes fat, or the primary part  in the process. I figure that I feel fine in general at least mentally, and no real abnormal colours of urine or stool, so I should be fine, right?",True,False,False,keto,t5_2rske,2352019,public,self,"Questions about electrolytes, dehydration etc.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/mhyrh6/questions_about_electrolytes_dehydration_etc/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,

It's teetering on the edge of developing into bowel Crohn's, but the condition inevitably develops regardless... Unless keto can stop this? I also suffer from asthma, hayfever, coffee/caffeine allergy, and various other immune related illnesses. 

I did keto for 6 months straight a couple of years back, felt great, but then relapsed due to the food I was eating on keto conflicting with Crohn's. All that changed when a suspected heart attack (I was only 27) turned out to be severe heart inflammation, caused by the mature cheeses and cured meats I was using as snacks. 

After that I've been eating clean meats, dairy, fats, leafy greens etc, but constantly been in and out of illnesses, fevers, etc. 

Long story short, I've found the root of the problem years late, coffee! It has seriously been messing me up to the point where I developed a fistula, the dreaded beginning of Crohn's. It still hasn't been fixed after 2 years, although the pandemic didn't help. 

My question is, am I able to live healthily on keto if my diet consists of meat, leafy greens like broccoli, butter, and peppers/onions/asparagus for flavouring? I can add macadamia nuts in too for a snack, as they are well tolerated. 

I have ketoaide supplemented to make up the minor shortcomings when it comes to electrolytes too, and the food itself is well salted. 

Each day has around 100g of butter total added to meals, in addition to using fatty meats such as chicken thigh and beef shin. It's also the only way I can add variety by switching meats. 

Sorry for the long post, but if I eat this way in addition to keeping on top of electrolytes and supplements, I should be fine right?

Symptoms of my illnesses have reduced significantly since switching to clean fresh foods and avoiding fermented products such as coffee and cured meat. I just want to make sure I won't be killing myself by eating like this!

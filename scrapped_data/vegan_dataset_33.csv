5. Coconut

6. Cashew

7. Pea

Neutral:

8. Almond

I want to share how my lifestyle changed going vegan and how it gave me a new perspective about what we're eating and the overall picture with the current food chain. 

I also want to know what you're going to think about my perspective since I have in some ways different views for which I will get maybe downvoted but just hear me out. 

When I started college I started living on my own which meant that I had to cook for myself which I never did before moving out. I wanted to start experimenting a little with what I eat and my friend told me he was a Netflix documentary The Game Changers which I decided to give a try and try to avoid animal and dairy products on my plate. It started slowly but I stopped buying meat, then slowly getting rid of eggs, cheese, switched to plant-based milk. 

With this change, my teenage acne is 98% gone which was bad when I was in high school. Energy levels really boosted, I don't feel heavy when I finish my meal even if I fill myself completely, discovered so many ways of cooking and recipes.

After seeing this change I was reading more about how animal agriculture works and it was such an eye-opener how messed up the whole industry works and how I was uneducated about where does the food come from, what does it contain, how much nutrition it has, what's good and what's not, how many animals are killed. 

Coming from an Eastern Europe where meat is basically on a plate every second day it was quite a change, my family is still in confusion why the 'drastic' change but I won't be coming back to the eating habits because with the information I gained. 

Living in ignorance or unawareness about how my actions impact animals, the planet was, on one hand, blissful, because let's face it, everybody loves cheese, meat but it's not right at the expense of others, not in this era when we have so many substitutes and options to choose from and with the climate crisis.

But here's my second thought about it: if the animal industry and dairy industry operated in a more sustainable, moral way, I would support it. 

I grow up in a village my grandma had her own chickens whose eggs were incomparable with the ones available in supermarkets.  We also got a homemade cheese from one of her friends who got their own cows.

My belief is that if dairy, animal products were consumed once a month or just on special occasions and didn't take it for granted, we could reduce the suffering, global warming in a great way.

Right now in college, I am fully vegan, I read carefully what's on the label of the products I buy making sure no animal ingredients are in them.

However, when I come home for a few weeks I have to cheat because I am not the one cooking and my family always puts some milk, dairy into the food but I won't touch any meat they prepare. I can see that I made some positive impact on my family and friends as well, they started eating oats in the morning, tofu, soya chunks but they are not willing to transform their eating habits completely.

This guys blew the lid off this conspiracy and hopefully has caught a lot of people’s attention enough for more of us to make the change, because it’s a change that is 100% worth making.

Also a lot of people, myself included tend to avoid these documentaries because of how raw and sad they are.

The pain I experienced watching these documentaries is absolutely fuck all to what these breath taking beings experience.

I cried my eyes out several times. The section where they filmed in Denmark, I was inconsolable. But the information in this documentary was something we should all be aware of because it is staggering. Maybe if there’s a way for someone to summarise all the facts of the documentary without having to witness the pain and torture of these beings and make a post about it I think that might be a great idea.

Now not to say that veganism as an ideology is not worth criticism, but I keep getting videos recommended popping up in my FY page that play semantic games about veganism. Imagine if I said for example, ""everyone should donate to charity"" one would naturally assume that I am not including homeless and low income people. To assume or argue that this was the implication would clearly be a disingenuous assumption. But these are the same equivalence made about veganism on tiktok.

People are constantly implying that veganism is somehow colonialism. Trying to argue from a perspective of race that vegans are trying to use Imperialist ideologies to domineer oppressed cultures. Which I know that getting sustainable food is important and trying to buy food which was acquired using laborers who aren't abused financially is of course important to vegans. Most of us are deeply concerned not only about animal rights, but about human rights as well. Veganism as an ideology is altruistic in its essence. It really boggles me how people can argue that all we eat are quinoa and avocados, something that is very clearly exaggerated to seem as though we enjoy exploiting those in developing nations and their labour, but then ignore how their diet does the same. Most of the crops imported to and grown in the western world are used for the sake of the animal agricultural industry. This exploits the labour of the workers. Carnists use these arguments as if they themselves don't also consume the same products we do.

What angers me even more is they argue for example, that veganism is somehow racist to indigenous people and then ignore the destruction of the Amazon for animal agriculture, which is home to hundreds of indigenous tribes. Or how about the fishing industry which has fought tooth and nail, especially in Canada against the fishing rights of indigenous people, which in turn causes food insecurity? Not a peep. But they use their politics to try and instill an ideology that is based in false equivalencies. 

Wanna talk about discriminating towards people of low income? How about chicken farmers in the states who live at or below the poverty line because of industry abuses? Or maybe we should see low income communities like those in North Carolina who are predominantly Black, Native American and Latinos who live near CAFOs and are dying of diseases such as cancer caused by pollution from animal waste? Or how about the fact that the last 10 global pandemics have been caused by the animal food industry, which have disproportionate health outcomes for the people in the most empoverished communities? Or how about the fact that most of the world's lowest paying jobs are those of fast food workers? How about the fact that the animal agricultural industry is one one the highest sources of green house gas emissions in global warming which will harm the world most vulnerable communities as the global temperatures continue to rise? Anyone wanna mention any of that? Yet somehow veganism is exploitative and classist?

The fact alone that we have enough food on the planet to end world hunger, yet most of the world's crops go are used to feed livestock which go to feed the world richest nations is horrifying. This is somehow a reality we're all accustomed to and have collectively decided is ok. Somehow veganism is the problem.

Now as I mentioned earlier, problems in vegan food sourcing like any other diet are worth dicussing. Like migrant workers yielding crops at what is essentially slave labour is horrifying. But this is not an issue caused by veganism, nor will it be solved by attacking veganism. If there were no vegans, this would still be an issue as news flash, carnists also eat vegetables.

I am sick of the semantic games and I am sick of the accusations. Why are these issues only raised when the subject of veganism is brought up... I don't see these carnists advocating against exploitation until it suits their biases. Can we all agree that it is getting ridiculous?

anyway, to cut to the point; dad is open to the idea! so that’s great. he asked his doctor, and they were supportive. in their view; at the very least, he’ll lose some weight (a thinner coffin! - no no, i joke... i don’t want him dead... i think he’d appreciate that joke, he has a terrible/great sense of humour, depending on your POV). 

anyway, obviously i want him to beat this fucking cancer. the vids also talked about fasting &amp; how that is excellent for the body to repair. 


he’s open to all this. though he seems to be a bit shocked at how prevalent carbs are. 


i have a question; is there any danger in switching to keto, after 60+ years of carbs &amp; sugars? he’s not terribly overweight, but he could be thinner. i suppose im a bit concerned the extra fats might be challenging for his heart... but maybe i’m misguided here? my friend tells me heart disease has nothing to do with (dietary) fats.


also, some foods aren’t good for diabetics (like coconut, right? that one always surprises me). but coconut is praised in keto diets (it seems). is there any risk for him, as a diabetic, in eating coconut? or the risk is for diabetics on regular (carb) diets?

The first two weeks, I tried to keep the calories under 2000 while hitting 100+g protein and 30 net carbs, to give some allowance while I became fat adapted.  The first two weeks I ate anytime between 8am-8pm, and I have been gradually closing the window as my hunger goes down over the past four weeks. I currently keep no more than a six hour feeding window, and I don't go over my fat or calories. I'm down to a small meal around 1pm, and dinner around 6pm. If I get hungry before or after then, I'm using green tea and broth with cream added (and I add those calories to my log for the day). I'm staying away from nuts and cheese, unless they are a portioned amount in a salad or recipe. Meals are mostly eggs from my chickens, beef, chicken, salads, broccoli, cauliflower stir fry ""rice"", and green beans. I stopped any alcohol a month ago. I drink electrolytes daily and didn't have too much of an issue with keto flu. 

I was definitely sedentary last October, but started walking, and I walk about four miles a day now between work and an evening walk. I don't really exercise other than walks, but I wasn't capable of even what I'm doing now as of a few months ago, and I'm happy with my physical progress.

My issue is that I'm not losing any weight at all. The interesting thing is that the day-to-day fluctuations have diminished, and I am spot on 269 every morning. I've noticed less swelling in my feet and fingers, and my belly is maybe not so distended. I have not taken measurements, but I could. I just thought \*something\* would have happened by now on the scale, and it's really getting me down. My fasting glucose numbers have come down (\~145 in December to \~115 now), and my (male, 49) partner has lost 11 lbs eating the lazy version of what I am, so I feel like I'm so close yet so far. 

Has anyone ever experienced this not leading to weight loss? Should I try cutting calories more? Should I increase calories? Is my body healing and not capable of current weight loss? Could there be something else at play I'm unaware of? I did have blood work done within the last year which is what led to knowing I need to lower blood sugar and weight, but I have no other issues that came up in general blood work. I do have PCOS and have been heavy all my life. 

Sorry for the novel, and thank you so much for any input, musings, suggestions, resources, or commiserations!

20F, 5.75ft, SW \~200 CW 190.2. started exactly 2 weeks ago, lost 5lbs per week. GW is somewhere from 150-170, but it's more about the way i look than the number :-)  


so, being two weeks in, i know that i've dropped my water weight, but i'm unsure if any of the weight loss so far is actual fat. i know that once you've dropped your water weight, your body's ""weight loss"" slows (the number on the scale decreases less dramatically between weigh-ins just cause water weight drops instantly while fat takes more time). i know that this is going to discourage me when i weigh in at the end of next week and dont see another 5lb at the least shedded off. should i start walking or jogging, doing a 16/8 IF, or something else? 

i'm not capable of HIIT, I hate intense workouts like that, i'd much rather just jog or something, and i'm on contrave so i can do IF no problem. but are there any other ways to combat plateaus aside from what ive listed? i'm the type of the person that is discouraged very easily and i want to avoid this seemingly inevitable thing as much as possible.

I also stopped biting my nails (on accident -- the urge to bite disappeared about a week into changing my eating) and started exercising ever day. I didn't set out to become a person who works out -- but I changed my eating and after a month I thought, ""Maybe I could be a person who exercises,"" so I tried a little bit, and I love it more every day. All of this surprises and delights me.

Before I get started, apologies for the format of this. I'm not super good at organizing my thoughts but I wanted to share my journey and the insights that have come to me along the way. Hopefully this is all decipherable. 

To begin with - I started my keto journey in late 2018 at a starting weight of 155 lbs and a goal weight of 110 lbs. I am 32F, 5'1"". See pictures in the imgur link at the bottom. NOTE: from the pictures 110 might be a little thin for me, but my rationale was that I might gain a lot of water weight and bounce back to 115 which I think is a maintainable weight that I would be really happy with. So that's how I came to my goal. 

Over the course of the next year and change, I lost a total of 39 pounds getting to a low weight of 116 pounds. Around January 2020, I took a 1 month keto break and went back up to 120. Staying on the horse after this break was difficult, and ultimately I fell off entirely when the pandemic hit. I ended up gaining 20 pounds back to 140.

Well New Year's came around, and I resolved to get back to my original goal weight of 110 lbs. 

I was pretty mad at myself that I let myself slip so much and let all that hard work go to waste, so I set a really aggressive goal of 2 lbs per week. Barring 1 or 2 bad weeks, I have kept up with this so far! It is now the end of Week 11 and I have lost 17 lbs. I definitely noticed I have lost weight a lot faster this time around. I don't believe it is because ""it's my second time"", but rather some key differences in the way I decided to approach Keto the second time and I'd like to share these with you.

Pre-Keto habits:

* **I was a fairly gluttonous person** with poor meal portion awareness/control. I just wanted to stuff my face all day everyday with my favorite foods, it was the most amazing and soothing feeling in the world.
* I lived for carbs. Pasta, pizza and potato chips specifically
* I loathed exercise

Keto first round (2018-2019) philosophy (**AKA THINGS NOT TO DO, even though I lost 39 lbs on it**):

* Diets had always failed for me, because I just wanted to always shove food in my mouth. I think the reason Keto initially worked for me was because, I figured out that as long as something had next to 0 carbs in it, I could basically eat as much as I wanted and still lose weight. This was basically a miracle diet for me. I made a list of foods that I didn't want to go without, found the ones that had very, very few carbs, and just shoveled those things into my face 24/7. In hindsight, this was really unhealthy but ultimately it got the ball rolling. But the takeaway is, **Keto initially worked for me because I was able to continue feeding my glutton habit.** 
* Toward the end of 2019, I was really beginning to crave carbs and would get sloppier and sloppier with takeout meals and cheat snacks. My rationale was ""the more fat I eat, the more carbs I can eat since really carb quota is based on percentage of total macros"". This led to **more snowballing with the gluttony**, and I found myself eating massive amounts of fat everyday to justify going up to 30 or 40 grams of carbs. I'm not sure if this logic actually holds true for Keto. I didn't gain weight, but I didn't lose weight either - probably due to the sheer calories in to calories out ratio.
* In the second half of 2019 I began to rely heavily on highly processed keto substitutes, what I call fake foods: products with wheat or milk protein isolate that mimicked puffy grains and cereals, baked goods such as cookies, brownies and cakes with fake sugar and almond/coconut flours, and substitute breads, such as almond meal bread, cloud bread, and whatever voodoo magic ThinSlim's breads are made of. At some point, my diet consisted of 80% or more of these packaged keto substitute fake foods, and I was barely even eating any veggies or meat. Once again, **my gluttonous tendencies had taken over** but this time I was trying to just eat as much comforting processed, easy-to-binge foods as possible. 
* I didn't have an exit strategy. My exit during January 2020 was basically, ""I miss carbs and I'm going to try to binge on them like crazy for a month to get the urge out of the way."" Yeah, right cadonana. This was dangerous, self-enabling, excuse-riddled talk. I never thought ahead to what my regular diet might look like after I hit my goal weight or came off keto. Heavens knows that the way I was eating was absolutely not healthy or sustainable, despite the fact that I was losing weight.

Queue the pandemic. Welllllll, old and constant friend Gluttony, let's see how we did:

* Absolutely just started eating my feelings and bingeing every processed comfort food in sight, in mass quantities. I'd run to the drug store in my PPE and clean out the kettle chips shelf once a week. Sometimes I'd sit in front of the TV and eat 2 bags of chips in one sitting. Rice, ramen, mac and cheese, pizza, oh my gosh. I'm surprised I didn't get diabetes during the pandemic. 
* I was also ""gluttonous"" in other ways. My retail therapy spending got out of control, and I found my front door being piled with packages of useless crap over the past year.

Hello 2021! Time for fresh starts and healthier perspectives. Well obviously, something had had to change. I had ballooned out to 140 lbs again. I was no longer fitting the new wardrobe I had bought myself in 2019. My bank account was drained. I was sleeping whenever possible, just barely doing the things I needed to. It was a pretty dark time for me. I felt like crap, physically and mentally. 

January 1st came around, and I resolved the next day I would stop shoveling mac and cheese into my piehole and start taking care of myself more. 

Here are the things I did differently the second time around:

* As mentioned before, I was pretty mad at myself and set an aggressive goal of 2 lbs per week. What really surprised me, 3 months in, is that I was able to more or less stick to this so far.
* I made a nifty chart (see link below) to track my progress and came up with some rewards for myself. I think this tracking chart actually helped my motivation immensely. It's so satisfying when I hit a day where I can color in another block! Note that I also laminated the chart, so I can erase progress in case I'm bad and gain weight again, haha. 
* Ironically, my severe spending habit in 2020 helped me in a way: In addition to starting up Keto again, I had put myself on a rather strict budget and savings goal for 2021. This helped me so much because I simply couldn't afford all those expensive, pre-packaged Keto fake foods that I had binged on so much in the year before. **I think the presence of really comforting, ""yummy"" foods in my cabinet really contributed to a binge addiction in 2019 for me**. 
* I'm focusing now on SIMPLE meals, 1) because I can't afford anything fancy or takeout right now, and b) I don't enjoy cooking and am too depressed/don't otherwise have energy to sink into preparing a nice meal. I think this, in combination with the lack of packaged fake foods, has really calmed down my so-called ""glutton response"". 
* Every now and then I do some meal prep and create some very tasty, complex keto dishes. Some examples are shirataki alfredo, or paneer tikka masala. However, I found that eating these foods completely triggered my glutton response. On the days I made these meals for myself, I would portion out enough for a whole work week but then eat it all in two days. **I just could not help myself with these more complex, savory meals. I would crave the flavor and the mouth feel so much that I literally could not stop myself from going back to the fridge for more**. In contrast, if I eat a simple meal of lightly seasoned roasted or steamed veggies with some simply cooked chicken for example, **I would always be satisfied with the portion I originally set for myself**. 
* The above 3 bullet points led me to realize that after all this time, after the 17 lbs I lost in 2021 and extreme self control I have exercised so far, **I still have an enormous psychological issue with food**. Okay, I know this was pretty obvious in hindsight, but I just couldn't define it well in my head. Maybe it's an addition to certain flavors or textures, maybe it's trying to fill the emotional void I feel with delicious foods. But now that I realized that, I'm going to avoid what I call ""complex meals"" (highly seasoned and well textured) until I can work with to figure out how to break the addiction. I will begin to work with a therapist soon on these issues!
* That being said, I do treat myself with a small packaged keto brownie every day or other day if I can afford to get some that week. But I make sure to get a bunch of one type at a time. This way I get sick of having the same treat every single day and it reduces my urge to binge, lol
* The last and (what I think is) most important point that I want to make is, that it is so, so, so much easier to restrict calories to a normal amount (as opposed to bingeing thousands of calories of fat) when you are not tempting yourself with your addictions all the time. Cramming your face with fat all the time for sustained period is not the way to go, like I did the first time. Sure, the benefit of losing weight more quickly right now is great because I am eating balanced (well, keto-balanced - still eating that scoop of cream cheese at the end of everyday to get my fat macros in), whole/real-food meals. But I'm realizing this is just so much healthier. I feel great, I have energy, I am happy with my weight loss. But most importantly, **I believe now that I can transition from this to a sustainable, permanent, healthy lifestyle after I come off keto**. I have identified a major psychological issue that I am going to address which will help me sustain a new lifestyle after I hit my goal weight. Because let's be real, life is better with carbs - but I only deserve them if I can stop myself from out of control shoving them in my face. And I believe I can achieve this.  

Next steps, and I think this is SO IMPORTANT!!!: **come up with an exit plan and permanent, healthy, maintainable lifestyle change for after I hit my weight goal.** Let's be honest. I love carbs. This second round of Keto has made me realize that I can have a healthy lifestyle of enjoying carbs for the rest of my life AND maintain the weight I want, if I only address my binge eating issues. I haven't come up with this plan yet, but on my list is:

* Experimenting in the weeks and months after I exit keto to find out what my ideal ""maintain weight"" calories/macros are, and factoring ""feeling good"" and ""having energy"" heavily into this. 
* Aggressively working on my bingeing issues in talk therapy. 
* Figuring out how to eat delicious foods that I'm likely to binge, without getting to that point
* Fun and maintainable exercise: A strength building routine, and finding a type of cardio that I don't hate. 

If you read all this, thank you! Again, sorry about the length and formatting/organization. I hope this helps people regardless!!

**tl;dr** 

* Eat real, whole foods during keto. Don't cheat with fake sugars, isolates. Rewarding occasionally is okay but be strict about how much you eat!
* This will help you with portion control and listen to your body to actually know when to stop eating. 
* Progress tracking charts are fun, helpful, and very motivational.
* Do some introspection and try to figure out your issues with food. This helped me discover a huge psychological issue I have with bingeing food and I'm going to get help in therapy for it now. 
* Now that I have discovered these things, I have so much hope that I can sustain a healthy diet  after I hit my goal weight and enjoy carbs/life in a healthy way!",True,False,False,keto,t5_2rske,2335323,public,self,Not my first rodeo - advanced lessons learned on Keto Round 2,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/m53kl2/not_my_first_rodeo_advanced_lessons_learned_on/,all_ads,6,,,TNT ,2c0c329e-abe8-11e8-a749-0ea6409e913c,Tips and Tricks,,,,

I could really use some of your experiences here. Firs of all, sorry in advance for any mistakes, English isn't my native language. 


So it's my first time doing Keto, and I've been doing it for the last 10 days, and I really love it. It's the first time I actually feel happy while drastically changing my diet... so I really really don't want to quit. My clothes already feel a bit loose, I feel my arms thinner and I'm much less bloated in general. One thing I've noticed is that finally after months, my workouts are showing visible results. So I want to stick with it, as a lifestyle and not just as means to an end. The thing is, I'm starting to worry because I have a history of hereditary heart diseases, heart attacks, strokes, high cholesterol and hyperlipidemia... my logic was, ok If a stick with Keto, I will be able to burn more fast than I did before, so it's gonna be fine, but that traditional approach of ""too much fat is bad for your heart"" it's starting to get to me because I definitely have been feeling my heart racing a lot, while resting, feeling kind of dizzy at times, and also really hot, sweating a lot, and a bit shaky sometimes. The doctors here follows in general this traditional approach, so going to them with a family history of heart disease, and doing keto seems like a no no (that means I'm pretty sure they are going to tell me to quit). One uncle actually did it and the doctor said he was ""destroying his liver and heart"". So I wanted to know if any of you have a similar experience while doing Keto, and if so, what are some of the things you can naturally expect. Also, if some of you know of more updated studies about fat and heart diseases, I've been searching but all I can find are those whose conclusions are ""too much fat is bad for the heart"".

At the time I was really afraid, so I began researching the internet for the best diet to treat this disease which is when I first learned about keto. I was so impressed with the science behind it that I decided to give it a try. And it worked.

It only took a day or two before I saw my glucose numbers drop to a normal range. The combination of LCHF along with intermittent fasting and regular exercise worked like a charm. Until I entered a long-term depressive episode (unrelated to keto) and I stopped for about a year.

The second time on keto was even better. I managed to bring my A1C down from 12 to 5.6. Then, you guessed it, I fell into another year long depression and stopped again. I began a year long food indulgence spree and ate whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. And now I fear the damage is too great to reverse.

Last week, I started to feel extremely weak. It was so concerning that I decided to check my blood sugar for the first time in over a year. The number I saw on the glucometer shocked me: 423. I knew it would be high, but not THAT high. It was something I could no longer willfully ignore, and decided immediately to stop this vicious cycle I was putting myself through and return to keto.

At first everything seemed to be going in the right direction. My blood sugar was still high, but in the 200s now instead of the 400s. I began OMAD IF (my usual) and moderate exercise. Basically, the same routine I had done twice before that seemed to work well for me. 

But after a full week of returning to a healthier lifestyle, I'm starting to feel defeated. I feel like the damage I've done to my body is too much and now it can't be fixed. I just CANNOT get my blood sugar below 200 anymore. Before it was so easy to do. Yesterday morning my glucose was at 234, and after drinking coffee with a tablespoon of heavy cream, it shot up to 320. This didn't make any sense to me.

It's super convenient, low in carbs, and seems like a fairly nutrient dense food (as opposed to shirataki rice, for example which has nothing in it besides fiber and water).

However, I’m concerned a little bit about oxylates and their ability to chelate other minerals and remove them from your body. I know that you can greatly diminish the oxylates by steaming or cooking – but that diminishes the ease of use, and I frankly don’t like cooked spinach as much as raw.

But, here’s my question, given the fact that spinach is so naturally high in minerals – like iron, magnesium, etc. – I’m wondering if the oxylates could be pretty much already be bound to plenty of minerals already?

So I am doing intermittent fasting and decided to combine it with keto. 
Yesterday was the first day and let me tell you it is hard. 

I think which makes it worse for me that I don't cook and don't like cooking. I mean I can do simple cooking, but the full professional cooking that require me standing on the stove for long time, manipulating food items,  or actually being there to do it is impossible for me. 

Also the veggies and the stuff required for keto is expensive and I don't like sea food. 

Yesterday I ate some boiled egg with tomato, cucumber and lemon. 
Today I spent almost an hour deciding what to do  staring at the fridge. I ended up frying some cauliflower and meat chuncks. ( There is no  name for this meal because I just decided to fry them since they are keto items). When I think about what to do tomorrow, my brain is blank.

As the picture in the link above partially indicates, they are chocolate and cinnamon flavor cereal puffs and they each seemingly have the same nutrition facts. I've tried the cinnamon and it definitely felt like I was eating Cinnamon Toast crunch in Kix form. Nice cereal-like crunch, even sitting in almond milk for a while.

Not perfectly 0 carbs, but 3g net ain't bad and it's nice to have options! (here's [the nutrition label](https://imgur.com/OGrR9ND))

My primary motivation for doing so is to boost my focus, in addition to all the other health benefits.  Long story short, I quit caffeine and nicotine about a year and a half ago but my focus dropped off a cliff.  To make up for it I thought I'd try a real keto diet (not just low carb) and I take some nootropics like Lion's Mane and L-Theanine. I manage to stay well below 20 net carbs per day and I intermittently fast using the 16/8 method. I can happily say that the combination of Keto + Nootropics has brought my focus back to the point where I can code (I'm a web developer) long hours into the night like I used to before I quit all forms of caffeine.

The downside to all this however is that since the first few days on Keto I have developed a persistent non-stop muscle twitch. It is mostly in both my legs (thighs, knees, and calfs), my feet, and occasionally my arms and eyelid. None of it is localized, it appears to be random, and I can always feel it at rest (so hundreds of times a day). All signs and everything I could read up on pointed towards an electrolyte imbalance (had a brief few days where I was certain it was MS or ALS lol). I decided to experiment and started taking a liquis magnesium supplement. The twitches subsided big time, although not disappear completely. To test my hypothesis further after a few weeks of taking the magnesium supplement I stopped just to see what would happen. What happened was my muscle twitches ramped back up from 10 to 100, and got as bad as they were when. I first started Keto. 

Having said all that and noticing the correlation between the twitches, and taking the magnesium supplement and not taking it, my question for you fine educated folks is ""at what point do I stop taking the magnesium?"" I can almost say for a certainty that the difference in twitches is huge between when I'm taking it and not. Is there any other electrolyte supplement I should be looking out for to help with the twitches as well?  If these supplements are indeed helping with the twitches and they come back when I'm not taking the supplements, is there a point in Keto where the electrolytes will balance itself out and the twitching will stop?

My issue comes on Saturday; I already do IF so I am not planning on eating breakfast with the rest of the crew (I will just order a hot tea or something). BUT for lunch we are going to a popular taco place (White Duck Taco in Asheville, for those of you in the area). I have been scouring their website for nutrition info but they literally do not post anything (UGH). I think I can get away with the fish taco in lettuce with pico de gallo and avocado crema (but without their nutrition facts, I really can't track macros). I also was looking at the ceviche as an option. ALSO, I have no idea where we are going to dinner so I really can't plan in advance, but might just pick a salad or if they have a protein then doing that. My issue is, I really don't know how many hidden carbs are in any of these things! Has anyone had success on travels like this? Looking for advice, anecdotes, or any hacks that y'all have to offer!

I'm off my blood pressure meds, and I'm no longer pre diabetic. My bloodwork has been awesome!

However, I've found that I have diverticulosis, and recently I had an attack of diverticulitis (basically an infection and massive bloating, swelling, etc...). I believe that it was due to eating some miracle noodles (basically straight up indigestible fiber) and more veggies than I usually have for our family's special Valentine's day weekend.  I was put on antibiotics and a scan confirmed diverticulitis. It was a few horrible days of feeling like there was a football in my gut, but it seemed to heal up rather quickly by fasting (just beef or chicken broth) for about 3 days. Then slowly adding in some basic foods like eggs and ground beef with salt only. 

Feeling pretty normal again 7 weeks later, I ate some dolmades (sausage stuffed grape leaves) and cauliflower falafel on Easter. They were all home made and keto, even the sausage. The falafel was made with cauliflower rice. But once again I had more very high fiber veggies than I usually do and started building up to an attack 9 days later. It wasn't quite as bad as the first time because I had a better understanding of what was going on and went to the Dr for antibiotics ealier, but it sure isn't what I would call fun.

I am back on fasting for the last 3 days. I've only had about 4 cups of broth each day along with water, and I'm supplementing with electrolytes and salt. I'll start on a few eggs per day over the next week and slowly work my way back.

Has anyone had success with fighting off diverticulitis with keto or carnivore? What was your experience? I feel I can track it down to days that I had high fiber stuff and probably over ate a little bit on holiday occasions. But I'm interested to know if others have had other experiences?

I'm not new to community and been a lurker for a while. I also tried keto few times before but kept failing and giving up due to very slow results, laziness, and crap I've been dealing with at those times.

I'm older now, wiser (hopefully haha), in a different place in my life and I want to try again and stay for good. But I was diagnosed with insulin resistance and been told that no matter what I do, I will not be able to lose weight w/o metformin. Problem is I have horrendous side effects from it and my body doesn't adjust to it. On metformin I'm as if a pregnant woman with extreme case of morning sickness, only that I'm not pregnant and that sickness lasts 24/7, with very bad stomach cramps on most days.

I feel brain fog, spacey, lack of motivation, hungry all the time. I generally feel no excitement. I can't drink caffeine because it triggers a lot of these feelings. I am 36 years old 6'1 270 lbs. I work a blue collar job and I struggle with it now. I used to powerlift so I have a bunch of muscle on my frame. I'm currently on Atorvastin for cholesterol and have been for a long time, testosterone cypionate every two weeks for hypogonadism, and I take beta blockers 10mg when I have to because I get anxious driving now because I'm afraid to get spacey in traffic. And as of 5 weeks ago my doctor started me on Metformin 500mg twice a day.

I am seeing an endo and she put me on metformin just to try it because she can't come up with anything else. We have done blood work after blood work. The only thing it showed recently was my RBC count was getting a little high. My fasting cortisol and insulin have been normal. I have had chest and head xrays and MRI's and they found nothing. I have seen a neurologist and he found nothing. 

So I came across a post on r/Brainfog touting the effectiveness of going full keto if you suspect you have hyperinsulinemia. I went ahead and did this in August. By day 3 all of my symptoms were gone. No more lightheadedness 2 hours after eating. No more never ending cycle of needing to eat. It was heaven. I was able to drink alcohol again with no long term effects. I lost 11 lbs and was down to 259. I was bike riding occasionally during this and that didn't affect me like it used to. That lasted 5 weeks. Then all of symptoms came back. Not as aggressive but I'd say 75% of what they were. 

Since then my doc gave me a Dexcom BS monitor to try. During the first 10 day run my BS was perfect. Now I'm doing this second run and I've introduced working out. My symptoms are growing worse. Any time I do any weight lifting I am starving for the next 3 days. Nothing fixes my hunger, I'm extremely lightheaded. I did 4 sets of squats along with some cardio on Wednesday and ate a sensible keto dinner after. Yesterday I felt the worst I've felt in years. No food satiated my hunger. Last night I went to bed with a headache. I feel my body retaining water. My BS monitor showed my BS bounced up and down all night. Anywhere from 131 to 86. The previous 10 day cycle showed nothing like this. 

I feel awful the next day if I go over my 30 carbs the previous day.
I'm not losing any weight like I did the first 2 weeks. Everyone says losing weight will help but whenever I restrict eating all my symptoms come back harder than ever. 

My questions are this: could this be an adrenal issue? Could weightlifting be triggering it somehow? Should I take a break from keto? I keep hoping to get anther 5 weeks like I had in the beginning. Is this just hyperinsulinemia like I suspect? Are there any other tests I can request?  Any help is greatly greatly appreciated.

I've been always a *sports kind of guy* through high school and early twenties. However after 25, I started to gain weight. Slow at first and probably some can relate that each time I was on the scale, you say to yourself *this isn't that bad...*. If you keep doing this, get less active because of a hectic professional and personal life and include eating out, or choosing fast-food instead of cooking up something decent, it adds up pretty fast.

Fast-forward to the present, at 38, and the weight scale showed a scaring 102 kg (224 pounds). Now before I had tried keto, with success. The first time I saw that I was going to +100kg, I managed to get it back down to 94kg (207 pounds). Which is still too heavy since I'm 1m75 (5 feet 8 57⁄64 inches) but I was on a roll, right? Then Covid happened.

Seated at home, permanently but lucky enough to still have work, bread and pastas were within arms reach and I started to gain weight again and an alarming rate until present day.

Having failed to stick to a keto lifestyle, since we all know it's not a diet, I decided that I needed guidance.

## Pronokal

I'm not sure how popular or familiar people are with the Pronokal method but in Belgium it's a *kind of* diet under the supervision of a doctor. Every two weeks I check in, measurements are taken and every four weeks my blood gets tested.

The diet consists of Pronokal products of their own, combined with 400 grams (1 1/2 cups) of largely green vegetables (very restricted which ones are allowed). Once you reach a certain target weight, you progress to the next step where you'll replace some of their own products with lean meat or chicken for instance.

At the end, you should be eating more or less keto-ish. I know or believe they re-introduce carbs into the diet as well at some point but I'm far from that moment in time. The doctor checkup continues up until two years after your last step to make sure you made the correct food adaptions and don't relapse.

A lot of questions remain to be answered but it seems that I really need the doctor follow-up to motivate me and to continue.

## Progress

I started this new *adventure* on March 15th, at 102kg (224 pounds) and the scale this morning after a month indicated 90,7kg (199,95 pounds) so that's a loss of about **11 kg (24 pounds)** in one month.

I'm sure the weight loss will slow down after this initial step 1 once I introduce different kind of foods again.

## Surprises

I'm really surprised that I don't miss the carbs, sugars, etc. I used to *really* enjoy food. Having two plates of pasta and ice cream afterwards. Eating lots of bread each day and drinking *zero* beverages. I was afraid I'd miss all those. Don't get me wrong, we're a family of four and I'm the only one on *a diet*. It's not difficult but sure the smell of french fries with steak from the other people in the family smells delicious. But I think a key factor to  the success of *this* and keto in general, is that there are no cravings. I'm full after eating, feeling full for a long time and **mental clarity** is insane.

I used to be one of those people that would forget *anything* unless I wrote it down in some todo-list or a notes app. Right now, I remember work-related discussions from four weeks ago like they happened yesterday.

I have a little problem though, I'm a difficult sleeper and have struggled with sleeping problems throughout my life, mostly because it takes me a while to fall asleep.

I could attribute that to anxiety associated with starting a new diet that drastically changes my eating habits, but idk.

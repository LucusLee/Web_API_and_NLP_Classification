Journey so far. I started keto on 12-2019, I was 326 lbs and noticed my quality of life was poor. I went to a Dr who does medically supervised weight loss and I knew if I followed his instructions I would have success. I already knew lots about it, but he taught me all about the keto diet and told me to follow the carb/protein/fat numbers he set for me, and gave me basically a large FAQ folder to take with me. For the first couple months I saw him every two weeks, with weigh ins that provided a printout of my progress with nifty little graphs and all. We would talk about what kinds of things I was eating, how I was feeling, etc. and would be a coach/counselor/cheerleader. Once I was adapted to the lifestyle we moved to 3 weeks between appointments. I looked forward to my time with him and tried to avoid weighing myself outside of his office so it felt like a treat to see my new number. Once I had lost a good amount of weight, and my energy was high, he got me to start working out. I got a gym membership and was going 3-4 days a week!  I loved my gym days and was shocked that it had taken me so long to go. Everything was going perfect, then, Covid. I was actually at the gym when I got the text that they would be closing indefinitely in a few hours. No biggie, I went to the store on my way home to buy resistance bands medicine balls among other things to work out in my garage. I got everything set up, and never used it once. Going to my garage to work out didn’t have the same feel of going to the gym, and I just couldn’t do it. It’s ok though, I’ll just stick to the diet. By this time, no in person Dr appointments allowed. So I could no longer weigh in and get my cool graphs. I tried zoom style appointments but it wasn’t the same. I kept eating keto and on April 30, 2020 I was 262 lbs. 64 pounds lost in less than 5 months!!!! Incredible!!!  Well that was the lowest number I would see on the scale. I slowly started cheating here and there, mostly for comfort in this crazy new world we were in. Before long I was 100% off keto. For a long time I stayed pretty close to my lowest weight, I had learned about portion control, only eating when I needed to and stopping when my body told me to. Eventually I fell back into over eating, eating for fun, and comfort, and to satiate boredom. Pounds started rising and me new clothes got tight. I didn’t step on a scale for a long time. 1-1-2021, I stepped on a scale...312.  I was so upset and disappointed, I promised myself I would never go back to where I started. The next morning, I was 100% keto! I dropped down to 295 quick, and stayed there, for about 3 weeks. What was I doing wrong?  I soon realized I was using all the “keto” “low carb” products from the grocery store. I cut those all out and went back to basics. Meat, cheese, eggs, avocado, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts. That’s it, only thing I will put in my body. Today I am 272 and 10 lbs away from my first goal of getting back to where I was a year ago. I am hoping to hit my goal of 262 by April 30, the date I hit 262 last year.  I just want to end by saying thank you to everyone who shares their stories here. I read them often and you all give me tons of motivation. Sorry for the long post, but it’s been a long journey so far.

I’m bigger so weighing myself has never been high on my to do list. The last time I knew my weight was when I went to the doctor for a checkup about 6 months ago. 

I started Keto 6 weeks ago and I’m loving it so far. When I started I did not intend on using my scale since I figured my goal would be “drop a shirt/pant size” rather than numbers. But I’ve been feeling so good that I decided to break out the scale about a month in. I was down 30 pounds from my last known weight. And I’ve been weighing every week and now I’m down 44 pounds according to my scale but my clothes still basically fit the same. The pants are a little looser but that’s it. 

Is this normal? Should I try a different scale?

The last 10 days have been especially amazing for me.

I am so excited to see strong progress lately. [As I mentioned in my 3-months-in (well, just short of 3 months) first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/mce27a/my_keto_journey_thus_far_3_months_in_long/) in /r/keto, I had experienced. pretty strong progress though with some periods of frustrating (though expected, per the FAQ) slow loss. I recently realized, however, that I was probably sabotaging my progress somewhat; despite being fairly strict and tracking my intake somewhat regularly, I was eating unaccounted-for nuts and breaking my intermittent-fasting with late-night Scotch (double-whammy, calories + the interrupted IF). Needless to say I wasn't adding those nuts or drinks to my log in MFP.

Starting on 3/21 I started tracking every nut (in addition to everything else I'm eating) and stopped drinking as much, and definitely no more IF-busting drinks. The nut-tracking isn't as bad as it sounds - using my scale I know that 2 toasted pecans is about 5g, and 2 almonds is about 2g, so it's fairly easy to track that in MFP in my head now without the scale.

Coincidence or not, you can see a marked improvement in the rate of loss since 3/21, really kicking in on 3/26 where the weight started falling off. The only thing I really changed was what I mentioned above. **That's almost 5lbs in the 10 days since 3/25!** 

My caloric intake is lower since 3/21 overall, but I'm still hitting my protein macro of about 120g/day

Thanks to /r/keto! It's great to see everyone else's  struggles and triumphs, and posting helps me stay accountable to myself.

Could it be that I'd need bile supplements? My naturopath prescribed me digestive enzymes and I also need to take a few natural treatments for my leaky gut.

Okay, quickest backstory: obese my whole adult life. In 2014-2016, I had lost 60lbs/27kg with Keto. (You can see in my post history how well I had done once). Moved to Korea in 2016, gained everything back plus a little more (and hypothyroidismㅠㅠ)

Anyway!

Since March 2020, I started fixing my habits again. I’ve been Keto since November 2020!

As of today, I’ve lost 63lbs/28.5kg! I’m 7lbs away from getting back to my low weight a few years ago, but still have much more to lose from there.

BUT THE NSV is something I could only feel in Korea...!!

Koreans are quite... truthful lol when it comes to weight. Sometimes brutally honest ㅋㅋ They are also just generally thinner, and there’s a high expectation for appearances here. So being obese in a country like Korea has been extra rough on my self-esteem (but I’m working through that, don’t worry!). I’m still AT LEAST 54lbs/24.4kg away from a “healthy” weight. So I didn’t expect comments for a while, but good lord at least I’m feeling amazing again, finally. 


I catch the bus to work in the morning and always wait with a middle-aged woman who lives near me. I’m talking over 4 years of us waiting together. She doesn’t speak English, and I speak kindergarten Korean at best. I understand more than I can say, but we always manage to have little “chats”. She takes care of me like picking cat hairs off my shirts, holding an umbrella over me, etc. It’s a cute relationship we have!

This week, she asks me (always in Korean) if I’ve lost weight!! I was SHOCKED she noticed AND said something! I told her how much, explained “no carbs” and “no exercise yet” haha. She was amazed. Today (a few days later), she said again how pretty I look and then tells me she didn’t eat carbs for dinner this week and she is happy she’s no longer bloated! I INSPIRED MY MIDDLE-AGED KOREAN BUS AUNTIE!

THEN. Tonight, I pop into my local convenience store. The woman who works there has witnessed first hand my absolutely horrendously trash diet for years. Carbs, microwave meals, crisps, bottles of wine... I don’t go in as often anymore because I cook at home and don’t drink right now. But I needed paper towels. 

Again, she does not speak English and I do not speak nearly enough Korean. But she asks me if I’ve lost weight!! And again, I tell her how much and that I eat Keto and she’s amazed and so kind and complimentary. 

I know I’m still obese. I stand out as a foreigner anyway, never mind being overweight. But like... my Korean neighbours are noticing and are proud of me. Despite the language barrier, they are making effort to comment! None of my Korean co-workers have commented yet. I’m curious when or if... haha. 

Also, bonus NSV: I just want to give myself props for finally taking the time to commit to learning how to do Keto long-term in Korea. I did it! I get it now! It’s actually become intuitive for me and that feels great.

I was diagnosed with PCOS when I was 14 (I guess?) and hypothyroidism around at age 12. Thanks to these 2 conditions and gorgeous genes (/s)I gained weight rapidly through the years, to the point where I ended up obese by age 16/17. I have seen numerous endocrinologists and all they have to offer is birth control pills and metformin for PCOS and meds for thyroid. While thyroid pills never seemed to bug me, BCs basically took a toll on my mental health and I guess led to me gain more weight. And another excellent advice all of them gave was to reduce weight, which by the way didn’t happen even on a 1100 cal diet with 1 hour at the gym in the evenings and 3-4 km runs in the morning. Whatever little I lost, I always gained double that in less than half the duration. With all of this, I lost confidence in myself and developed tonnes of insecurities. My mom constantly reminding me that I’m fat, lazy, slow, hairy, useless etc doesn’t help either. 

In the beginning of 2020, I tried keto as it looked like the only way I could control my PCOS symptoms. It worked decently and I lost close to 13 kgs (~ 28 lbs) in 2-2.5 months. For me, that was a lot since I never lost that much weight before. Due to the pandemic and not having enough supplies, I had to stop keto and get back to a “regular” diet. A year went by and thanks to my chronic illnesses, I gained back all 13 and 3 kgs more.

On 2nd of March, I was determined and started the keto again. So far, I just lost 6 kgs (~ 13 lbs) most of which must be water weight. I don’t know what’s going wrong but I can’t seem to lose weight. I also have a lot of physical fatigue. As my mom says something that triggers me, I end up not eating as much as I probably should. I consumed a total of ~850 calories yesterday. For someone my size, that’s really less. This leaves me with practically no energy to workout. I’m trying to eat more often but I just can’t seem to get hungry. I believe I’m not on ketosis. Could you suggest ways consume more fat in smaller meals or any other advice? Not being able to lose weight through the only way that works for me is so painful. I want to at least get to 70kgs (~155 lbs) by this August. Any advice would be highly appreciated!

I was 377 and now I'm at 315 and I'm stuck.  I was 315 for the last few years, it has been my baseline, I gained the excess during covid.  I almost feel like my body is stuck there out of habit. 

I eat very clean and almost zero carb, not net carb, zero, except for fiber.  Eggs, Bacon, Steak, salmon, clean cheeses, olives (Thank god for LIDL) and steamed broccoli or cauliflower with garlic and ginger.  I cook in a combination of GHEE and Beef Talow.  Lets call it 1000 to 1500 calories a day.  70 percent fat, 29 percent protein or close to those proportions.... and I take psyllium husk caps at every meal (for the bulk and for the digestive benefits)

ACV w/ Mother twice a day, Fermented Tumeric, Institol in the morning along with my other water solubles.  Fat supplements later in the day because I take 150mcg of Synthroid in the morning and try to avoid interactions (Good quality omega 3 only fish oils, 200 mg CO-Q10, 10000 IU Vit D3 every other day).  I supplement with minerals as I feel my body needs them.  With Pink salt and bone broth probably at least once every other day.

I do a 24 hour fast once a week, mainly because I end up just not being hungry (I don't count my keto coffees during the fast.)

I have (2) 16 ounce homemade keto coffees a day, 3 tbsp spoons of heavy cream, a tbsp of organic cacao powder, 2 scoops of HMVN collagen w/ MCT's and a good few shakes of organic Cinnamon.

I don't work out intentionally yet,  I was hoping to get a little leaner to so I don't mess up my joints, I just make sure I get in 10k steps most days.  I'm no stranger to working out, it was my life 20 years ago.  My ankles and calves would swell to the point my socks would put a 2 inch indent.  Now my ankles look boney....

2500mg potassium
800mg magnesium

Water is about 8 cups day (sometimes more if I'm thirsty, but felt I was drinking too much before and losing electrolytes.)

My macros are 10-15 carbs, 75-85mg protein, and 100mg+ fat.

My weight is 120lbs, I'm 5'3"", and calories around 1500.

Anyway, since starting, I've been extreamely fatigued and sleepy. And it hasn't let up. I have not cheated, even once.

My feeling is maybe eventually when I'm ""fat adapted,"" this will change, but it's been a struggle.

I took my TSH and t4 yesterday and they have indeed went up from last month (but are still in range.)

All my electrolytes and triglycerides look good.

I was thinking about asking for a t3 reading from my endocrinologist (since keto is known to lower that--though I'm not sure of the significance since I'm not using carbs.)

Anyway, do you think it's just that I'm not fat adapted yet?

Or maybe a thyroid issue? Does anyone else have thyroid issues who does this diet?

So, I started doing 3 pasture raised eggs, 1 sausage, and a few mushrooms for my breakfast 5-7 days a week, and eating some liver and onions on the weekend.

However, I just don't think I have enough time anymore in the morning to cook this semi-involved breakfast, clean the pan, clean the cutting board/knife, and then eat everything. It takes way more time to make than a bullet proof coffee. So, I want to switch back to doing that every day, and eating liver or eggs on the weekend when I have more time.

After a couple week self imposed plateau, I've wandered into One-derland!

I discovered the fasting subreddit.  My first 42 hour fast broke my plateau and helped teach me to eat slowly and smaller.  I also incorporated \~ 9000 steps per day at this time.  This pushed my weight from 210 - 205.  Recently, I started a journey based entirely in lunacy - I was inspired by the folks at /r/fasting to begin a 7 day fast.  I'm on day 4, although it has been a bit dirty, I've had 3 drinks over those 90 hours, but otherwise very successful!  I've ramped my walking effort up from 9000 steps to the 10k - 15k range, but I won't be sustaining that over a longer period of time.  I dropped from 205.6 at the start of the fast to 198.8 this morning.  I know much of that is water weight (which is puzzling, since I've been pretty good about being keto for 2 months), but it felt amazing to step on the scale and see a 1 in the hundreds digit!  I'm hoping that in the following 3.5 days, I can lose enough mass to stay in the 190s after breaking fast.

I'm posting this here because... frankly, I couldn't dream of getting nearly 4 days into a fast without keto.  Given the voracious hunger, I would have broke on day 1, day 2 at best.  Overall, I've lost about 25 pounds in 2 and a half months.  My prediction for onderland was the first week of April and I seem to have beaten that mark by one day.

I hope everyone is doing well thus far. 

I apologize in advance if this has been previously inquired upon. 

I have been fasting regularly and I have a regimented schedule consistently for roughly 2 years now. 

I get up at 3:30am everyday and in the home gym by 4:00am. My workouts consists of light cardio (bike,rower,jump rope rope) for about 30minutes and another 30minutes doing mobility/flexibility work. Then about an hour of weight lifting(not bodybuilding) and some CrossFit’esq type workout. 

During this activity, I am in a fasted state which I will break around 11:00am-12:00pm. Which translates to about 18 hours of fasting. 

My question, during this ketosis state my body is in, if I get a cholesterol check will it register an elevated result?

I am 45 years old and I consider my diet low to mid in saturated fat. 

I eat red meat once a month and do not regularly consume processed food.

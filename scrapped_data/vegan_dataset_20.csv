Just take the best vegan cheese you can find Vio Logie Mozarella blocks and Parmesan Powder works. Other good brands are Daiya and Green Vie.

Basics.

1. Grate it yourself
2. Add the Parmesan
3. Add small amounts of almond milk.
4. Heat on low and turn to sauce at desired level
5. Use as you want to

We are working on creating an Instagram support pod using Telegram with a focus on vegan lifestyle, sustainable &amp; cruelty – free fashion. If you have are working to grow on Instagram, this could be a great pod to join &amp; grow your reach and engagement. 

If you are unfamiliar with Telegram pods, they are communities formed to increase your reach and visibility on Instagram. You will need to download Telegram app to join. While there are many other engagement pods out there, we were not able to find one with a vegan / sustainable fashion niche so we created one. Here is the link: [https://t.me/ethicalfashion\_insta](https://t.me/ethicalfashion_insta)

Note: We just launched this group so if you are one of the first couple of users to join us, please simply share the post you want engagements on.  

PS: A lot of pod admins will make it mandatory to follow their accounts which we think is a very ineffective way of growing. That being said, if you end up joining our pod &amp; choose to follow us, please feel free to DM us you are from Reddit and we will follow you back!

I don't think I ever once imagined a lamb shank to be an actual leg of a baby. Not once. I think I tried while eating it in a restaurant at one point, but my mind just wouldn't let itself go there.

There's something mind numbing about the act of eating.

Is it okay ethically to not reveal you are vegan to those around you when they keep questioning it, noticing that all your “excuses” seemingly align with vegan outcomes?

In terms of health...I watched my father die of cancer. It broke me. Every time I see the animal products he consumed a lot of....I think of the agony he went through in the last stages of his life....and I can’t bring myself to bring that pain into my life again...so I immediately go for whole food plants to hopefully prevent it.

A lot of my family heavily argues cancer is just in the family line. While I disagree with them, I’m not a doctor so I don’t know how educated I am on the topic, so I stay quiet.

My father got cancer. His father got cancer. Both died in their 50s long before they should have... both the kindness members of the family... sad face.

Everyone (in former associations I had with them, when we would regularly eat together... we don’t do it anymore because of ... reasons... see profile for irrelevant explanation of that...) heavily argued non stop that my grandfathers death was genetic.

Thing is.... they eat so much god dam meat. Every meal: 
Meat: red meat; fish; chicken; or some other former sentient animals flesh.

So much bacon. Ungodly amounts of bacon. So much so, that when my loving grandmother made me a bean soup (she’s the only one who I told I was plant based. But she’s not the brightest person and never understood it, so this wasn’t intentional on her part, trust me): she put bacon in the sauce to flavor it. Thinking it was fine since it was only a bit.

Dairy: cheese, so much god dam cheese; milk; 

When I was a young child I naturally consumed The same foods, up until about 15.

Looking back, my symptoms were INSANE and really bad, such that I’m surprised I never considered the food I was eating could be causing me to have these issues.

Rashes: EVERYWHERE. For arms. Shins. Oh my god dam fingers. Bottom of my feet. It was so bad. Even when I didn’t scratch it would get worse, and when I did scratch I’d get blamed by my family for it getting to that point. “It’s only that bad because you scratch. If you stopped it would go away. (Nah it’s not the food at all). I’d wake up 3 days a week seeing blood everywhere on my bed from the scraps opening up.)

Cravings: I’d go through non stop physical shakes if I didn’t  have dairy products 3 times a week. My loving father had to limit My ice cream consumption to 3 days a week because I was ballooning up. But i was always trying... my best.. I swear... but the cravings kept getting more and more intense until I gave in.

Depression and fatigue. NON STOP FATIGUE. I’d be told by family that I just wasn’t eating enough, them proudly patting their ballooned stomach. I forced myself to eat more of the garbage food. I definitely ate more, but my fatigue got worse and I gained weight 


All of this is to just show.. how sick and tired I was of my health feeling like garbage. So I stoped. I told family My decision to just limit (l said lying, knowing i wasn’t eating any behind closed doors) animal products. So please , if they cook, just give me the non animal based parts of the meal.  I’d be more than happy to bring my own food if the entire meal is animal based tho, they had to do NOTHING extra.

First: they asked why. I explained that I was trying to see if changing my diet could help my symptoms. They told me I was being silly, it wasn’t the food. And that I needed to keep eating these health calorie dense foods, it’s in our DNA!

Second: when the above strategy did not work, and it became clear that for about 2 months I had not gave up (skin improving before their eyes. But they ignored that, claiming I was just not scratching... I was still scratching a lot. They didn’t believe me). They tried a new strategy: guilt tripping me.

They told me I could 100% “cheat” 1 day a week and my health would be fine. When I told them “cheating requires me to want to eat those foods because it brings pleasure, and I don’t get pleasure from the side effects I do still get after eating it, so I don’t “cheat” with foods that cause pain... they god mad.

“Oh. So your grandmother slaves over a stove and you are going to be disrespectful and not eat it? Wow.”

“No. I do eat the food she makes. See, I’m right now eating plain pasta. L

“It’s rude to not eat everything. You are insinuating she’s doing a bad job and making you sick. That’s rude”

“What? No, I’m just trying to figure out symptoms by isolating my diet to foods that work. And if I add something in it will show me if my reaction is negative. “

“I disagree. It’s rude. “

“(Seeing no other way out, I lied) my doctor told me to do this. Are you telling me I should ignore my doctor? “

This shut down all complaints. Once I tied it into “my doctor told me to do this”, they had a difficult time arguing back that I’m being rude. Although they did try, and the sane people at the table would go 

“dude. Does OP tell you to stop taking your anti acid pills your doctor recommended? “

“That’s not the same thing. This is food not medication.”

“I specifically heard you tell me your doctor told YOU not to eat X food groups and you wouldn’t need to take the anti acid pills. So unless you want us to judge YOU for ignoring doctors orders, leave op alone” (GO. GRANDMA. LOVE YOU. SO MUCH... even if you put bacon in my food without understanding why it was bad. But you stopped when I asked you not to, so we gucchi).

So....I know that was a long rant. But. My point: when I lie about being vegan to the awful people in my family, or awful people in general... it solves so many problems and allows me to live my life. I don’t want to be an activist right now given how bad and abusive my family was growing up. But, is lying unethical, and contributing to the problem even more, and I should be willing to take the hostility ?

When my family suspected I’d become vegan, the anger was INSANE. They literally told me I was lying to do them for X, Y, and Z reasons. They went off on how I was judging them for their choices and I needed to stop bullying them and just eat the dam food. And until I finally lied, telling them it was my doctors advice.... they kept getting worse.

Now. I am away from those family members now. But.... I just dont think I can handle the hostility associated with activism. But I can not contribute to the problem.

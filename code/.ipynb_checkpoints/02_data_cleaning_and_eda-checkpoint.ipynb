They say how milk is made to drink and how we need it and how I need to drink milk because almond milk is expensif! (while its cheaper than normal milk) Then there saying that my vegtables I buy to make my own food are to expensive while my sister bought €15 on delevir food and my parents €40 on tuna salad and fish dish.\\n\\nIm really sad that they cant suport me because its also hard for me, I was kinda adicted to choclate and other sweeties but all of these has milk or gelatine so I had to stop.

       "0  Im vegan for over a week (and vegi for 2+ years) and Im doing and feeling better than before! Im also moslim and Ramadan started recently so I only eat twice a day. Me, my parents and my siblings are eating around 10pm after not eating for some hours and then we get into a discussion because ‘Im crazy’ and ‘Im exaggerating’ so I told them why? They say how milk is made to drink and how we need it and how I need to drink milk because almond milk is expensif! (while its cheaper than normal milk) Then there saying that my vegtables I buy to make my own food are to expensive while my sister bought €15 on delevir food and my parents €40 on tuna salad and fish dish.\\n\\nIm really sad that they cant suport me because its also hard for me, I was kinda adicted to choclate and other sweeties but all of these has milk or gelatine so I had to stop. Im just happy I know that everything I stopped eating helped the animals :D   \n",

       "      <td>I was first diagnosed with type 2 diabetes about 4 years ago. At the time I was really afraid, so I began researching the internet for the best diet to treat this disease which is when I first learned about keto. I was so impressed with the science behind it that I decided to give it a try. And it worked.\\n\\nIt only took a day or two before I saw my glucose numbers drop to a normal range. The combination of LCHF along with intermittent fasting and regular exercise worked like a charm. Until I entered a long-term depressive episode (unrelated to keto) and I stopped for about a year.\\n\\nThe second time on keto was even better. I managed to bring my A1C down from 12 to 5.6. Then, you guessed it, I fell into another year long depression and stopped again. I began a year long food indulgence spree and ate whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. And now I fear the damage is too great to reverse.\\n\\nLast week, I started to feel extremely weak. It was so concerning that I decided to check my blood sugar for the first time in over a year. The number I saw on the glucometer shocked me: 423. I knew it would be high, but not THAT high. It was something I could no longer willfully ignore, and decided immediately to stop this vicious cycle I was putting myself through and return to keto.\\n\\nAt first everything seemed to be going in the right direction. My blood sugar was still high, but in the 200s now instead of the 400s. I began OMAD IF (my usual) and moderate exercise. Basically, the same routine I had done twice before that seemed to work well for me. \\n\\nBut after a full week of returning to a healthier lifestyle, I'm starting to feel defeated. I feel like the damage I've done to my body is too much and now it can't be fixed. I just CANNOT get my blood sugar below 200 anymore. Before it was so easy to do. Yesterday morning my glucose was at 234, and after drinking coffee with a tablespoon of heavy cream, it shot up to 320. This didn't make any sense to me. How can zero carbs cause such a dramatic insulin spike?\\n\\nThis post is already way longer than I intended it to be, so I'll just end it here. I didn't really know where else to turn. I feel like giving up, because I feel like it's too late for me. But at the same time I know keto is the best thing for me. And I'm too scared to go to the doctor because I don't want to start taking insulin. I wanted to fix this on my own but I no longer believe that I can.</td>\n",

Im also moslim and Ramadan started recently so I only eat twice a day. Me, my parents and my siblings are eating around 10pm after not eating for some hours and then we get into a discussion because ‘Im crazy’ and ‘Im exaggerating’ so I told them why? They say how milk is made to drink and how we need it and how I need to drink milk because almond milk is expensif! (while its cheaper than normal milk) Then there saying that my vegtables I buy to make my own food are to expensive while my sister bought €15 on delevir food and my parents €40 on tuna salad and fish dish.\\n\\nIm really sad that they cant suport me because its also hard for me, I was kinda adicted to choclate and other sweeties but all of these has milk or gelatine so I had to stop. Im just happy I know that everything I stopped eating helped the animals :D   \n",

Being plant based means so much to me because it helps the Earth and the animals. I work at an animal shelter. and foster. It just feels wrong helping one animal then eating another one. My wish is stay that way for a long time, but can I be vegan forever? I went through so many articles, but I just want some good old advice from anyone doing this diet for at least over 10 years or a substantial amount of time.   \n",

I enjoy learning about different ingredients and incorporating it into my own cooking. But I am limited as most shows out there are heavily meat based. Has anyone found a good vegan show? How can we get representation in the culinary entertainment world?   \n",

I’m a pretty new vegan, only fully cut out diary two moths ago. I’ve been trying to lose weight while still maintaining a health vegan diet. \\n\\nCould y’all give me some ideas for a good breakfast+dinner combo that will be nutritious and not very caloric - preferably around 1000kcal? Stuff that’s easy to make would be cool, but I’m willing to do a lot of prep work if the results are tasty:p   \n",

Thing is, the only ones that are wide (as in 3\") and high quality and padded are made of leather. It's damn near impossible to find a vegan bass strap with good grip and padding!\\n\\nDoes anyone have any recommendations as to brands or websites to look at that sell vegan guitar/bass straps? Getting desperate here - this thing is killing my shoulders.\\n\\nThanks in advance!   \n",

       "1002  I was first diagnosed with type 2 diabetes about 4 years ago. At the time I was really afraid, so I began researching the internet for the best diet to treat this disease which is when I first learned about keto. I was so impressed with the science behind it that I decided to give it a try. And it worked.\\n\\nIt only took a day or two before I saw my glucose numbers drop to a normal range. The combination of LCHF along with intermittent fasting and regular exercise worked like a charm. Until I entered a long-term depressive episode (unrelated to keto) and I stopped for about a year.\\n\\nThe second time on keto was even better. I managed to bring my A1C down from 12 to 5.6. Then, you guessed it, I fell into another year long depression and stopped again. I began a year long food indulgence spree and ate whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. And now I fear the damage is too great to reverse.\\n\\nLast week, I started to feel extremely weak. It was so concerning that I decided to check my blood sugar for the first time in over a year. The number I saw on the glucometer shocked me: 423. I knew it would be high, but not THAT high. It was something I could no longer willfully ignore, and decided immediately to stop this vicious cycle I was putting myself through and return to keto.\\n\\nAt first everything seemed to be going in the right direction. My blood sugar was still high, but in the 200s now instead of the 400s. I began OMAD IF (my usual) and moderate exercise. Basically, the same routine I had done twice before that seemed to work well for me. \\n\\nBut after a full week of returning to a healthier lifestyle, I'm starting to feel defeated. I feel like the damage I've done to my body is too much and now it can't be fixed. I just CANNOT get my blood sugar below 200 anymore. Before it was so easy to do. Yesterday morning my glucose was at 234, and after drinking coffee with a tablespoon of heavy cream, it shot up to 320. This didn't make any sense to me. How can zero carbs cause such a dramatic insulin spike?\\n\\nThis post is already way longer than I intended it to be, so I'll just end it here. I didn't really know where else to turn. I feel like giving up, because I feel like it's too late for me. But at the same time I know keto is the best thing for me. And I'm too scared to go to the doctor because I don't want to start taking insulin. I wanted to fix this on my own but I no longer believe that I can.   \n",

I feel like every recipe I find is either all bacon, or all cheese. Which are both SUPER high in calories. \\nWhere are the resources for low cal, healthy keto?!

I am definitely in a caloric deficit so idk what’s going on.  Does anyone know why I might be stalling despite the large calorie defect.   \n",

It's super convenient, low in carbs, and seems like a fairly nutrient dense food (as opposed to shirataki rice, for example which has nothing in it besides fiber and water).\\n\\nHowever, I’m concerned a little bit about oxylates and their ability to chelate other minerals and remove them from your body. I know that you can greatly diminish the oxylates by steaming or cooking – but that diminishes the ease of use, and I frankly don’t like cooked spinach as much as raw.\\n\\nBut, here’s my question, given the fact that spinach is so naturally high in minerals – like iron, magnesium, etc. – I’m wondering if the oxylates could be pretty much already be bound to plenty of minerals already? So, while maybe you aren’t getting the full value of the iron from the spinach, for example, it’s not like you are depleting other iron from what you are eating?   \n",

       "1002  i was first diagnosed with type 2 diabetes about 4 years ago  at the time i was really afraid  so i began researching the internet for the best diet to treat this disease which is when i first learned about keto  i was so impressed with the science behind it that i decided to give it a try  and it worked   it only took a day or two before i saw my glucose numbers drop to a normal range  the combination of lchf along with intermittent fasting and regular exercise worked like a charm  until i entered a long term depressive episode  unrelated to keto  and i stopped for about a year   the second time on keto was even better  i managed to bring my a1c down from 12 to 5 6  then  you guessed it  i fell into another year long depression and stopped again  i began a year long food indulgence spree and ate whatever i wanted  whenever i wanted  and now i fear the damage is too great to reverse   last week  i started to feel extremely weak  it was so concerning that i decided to check my blood sugar for the first time in over a year  the number i saw on the glucometer shocked me  423  i knew it would be high  but not that high  it was something i could no longer willfully ignore  and decided immediately to stop this vicious cycle i was putting myself through and return to keto   at first everything seemed to be going in the right direction  my blood sugar was still high  but in the 200s now instead of the 400s  i began omad if  my usual  and moderate exercise  basically  the same routine i had done twice before that seemed to work well for me    but after a full week of returning to a healthier lifestyle  i'm starting to feel defeated  i feel like the damage i've done to my body is too much and now it can't be fixed  i just cannot get my blood sugar below 200 anymore  before it was so easy to do  yesterday morning my glucose was at 234  and after drinking coffee with a tablespoon of heavy cream  it shot up to 320  this didn't make any sense to me  how can zero carbs cause such a dramatic insulin spike   this post is already way longer than i intended it to be  so i'll just end it here  i didn't really know where else to turn  i feel like giving up  because i feel like it's too late for me  but at the same time i know keto is the best thing for me  and i'm too scared to go to the doctor because i don't want to start taking insulin  i wanted to fix this on my own but i no longer believe that i can    \n",

       "      <td>I was first diagnosed with type 2 diabetes about 4 years ago. At the time I was really afraid, so I began researching the internet for the best diet to treat this disease which is when I first learned about keto. I was so impressed with the science behind it that I decided to give it a try. And it worked.\\n\\nIt only took a day or two before I saw my glucose numbers drop to a normal range. The combination of LCHF along with intermittent fasting and regular exercise worked like a charm. Until I entered a long-term depressive episode (unrelated to keto) and I stopped for about a year.\\n\\nThe second time on keto was even better. I managed to bring my A1C down from 12 to 5.6. Then, you guessed it, I fell into another year long depression and stopped again. I began a year long food indulgence spree and ate whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. And now I fear the damage is too great to reverse.\\n\\nLast week, I started to feel extremely weak. It was so concerning that I decided to check my blood sugar for the first time in over a year. The number I saw on the glucometer shocked me: 423. I knew it would be high, but not THAT high. It was something I could no longer willfully ignore, and decided immediately to stop this vicious cycle I was putting myself through and return to keto.\\n\\nAt first everything seemed to be going in the right direction. My blood sugar was still high, but in the 200s now instead of the 400s. I began OMAD IF (my usual) and moderate exercise. Basically, the same routine I had done twice before that seemed to work well for me. \\n\\nBut after a full week of returning to a healthier lifestyle, I'm starting to feel defeated. I feel like the damage I've done to my body is too much and now it can't be fixed. I just CANNOT get my blood sugar below 200 anymore. Before it was so easy to do. Yesterday morning my glucose was at 234, and after drinking coffee with a tablespoon of heavy cream, it shot up to 320. This didn't make any sense to me. How can zero carbs cause such a dramatic insulin spike?\\n\\nThis post is already way longer than I intended it to be, so I'll just end it here. I didn't really know where else to turn. I feel like giving up, because I feel like it's too late for me. But at the same time I know keto is the best thing for me. And I'm too scared to go to the doctor because I don't want to start taking insulin. I wanted to fix this on my own but I no longer believe that I can.</td>\n",

Im also moslim and Ramadan started recently so I only eat twice a day. Me, my parents and my siblings are eating around 10pm after not eating for some hours and then we get into a discussion because ‘Im crazy’ and ‘Im exaggerating’ so I told them why? They say how milk is made to drink and how we need it and how I need to drink milk because almond milk is expensif! (while its cheaper than normal milk) Then there saying that my vegtables I buy to make my own food are to expensive while my sister bought €15 on delevir food and my parents €40 on tuna salad and fish dish.\\n\\nIm really sad that they cant suport me because its also hard for me, I was kinda adicted to choclate and other sweeties but all of these has milk or gelatine so I had to stop. Im just happy I know that everything I stopped eating helped the animals :D   \n",

Being plant based means so much to me because it helps the Earth and the animals. I work at an animal shelter. and foster. It just feels wrong helping one animal then eating another one. My wish is stay that way for a long time, but can I be vegan forever? I went through so many articles, but I just want some good old advice from anyone doing this diet for at least over 10 years or a substantial amount of time.   \n",

I enjoy learning about different ingredients and incorporating it into my own cooking. But I am limited as most shows out there are heavily meat based. Has anyone found a good vegan show? How can we get representation in the culinary entertainment world?   \n",

I’m a pretty new vegan, only fully cut out diary two moths ago. I’ve been trying to lose weight while still maintaining a health vegan diet. \\n\\nCould y’all give me some ideas for a good breakfast+dinner combo that will be nutritious and not very caloric - preferably around 1000kcal? Stuff that’s easy to make would be cool, but I’m willing to do a lot of prep work if the results are tasty:p   \n",

Thing is, the only ones that are wide (as in 3\") and high quality and padded are made of leather. It's damn near impossible to find a vegan bass strap with good grip and padding!\\n\\nDoes anyone have any recommendations as to brands or websites to look at that sell vegan guitar/bass straps? Getting desperate here - this thing is killing my shoulders.\\n\\nThanks in advance!   \n",

       "1987  I was first diagnosed with type 2 diabetes about 4 years ago. At the time I was really afraid, so I began researching the internet for the best diet to treat this disease which is when I first learned about keto. I was so impressed with the science behind it that I decided to give it a try. And it worked.\\n\\nIt only took a day or two before I saw my glucose numbers drop to a normal range. The combination of LCHF along with intermittent fasting and regular exercise worked like a charm. Until I entered a long-term depressive episode (unrelated to keto) and I stopped for about a year.\\n\\nThe second time on keto was even better. I managed to bring my A1C down from 12 to 5.6. Then, you guessed it, I fell into another year long depression and stopped again. I began a year long food indulgence spree and ate whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. And now I fear the damage is too great to reverse.\\n\\nLast week, I started to feel extremely weak. It was so concerning that I decided to check my blood sugar for the first time in over a year. The number I saw on the glucometer shocked me: 423. I knew it would be high, but not THAT high. It was something I could no longer willfully ignore, and decided immediately to stop this vicious cycle I was putting myself through and return to keto.\\n\\nAt first everything seemed to be going in the right direction. My blood sugar was still high, but in the 200s now instead of the 400s. I began OMAD IF (my usual) and moderate exercise. Basically, the same routine I had done twice before that seemed to work well for me. \\n\\nBut after a full week of returning to a healthier lifestyle, I'm starting to feel defeated. I feel like the damage I've done to my body is too much and now it can't be fixed. I just CANNOT get my blood sugar below 200 anymore. Before it was so easy to do. Yesterday morning my glucose was at 234, and after drinking coffee with a tablespoon of heavy cream, it shot up to 320. This didn't make any sense to me. How can zero carbs cause such a dramatic insulin spike?\\n\\nThis post is already way longer than I intended it to be, so I'll just end it here. I didn't really know where else to turn. I feel like giving up, because I feel like it's too late for me. But at the same time I know keto is the best thing for me. And I'm too scared to go to the doctor because I don't want to start taking insulin. I wanted to fix this on my own but I no longer believe that I can.   \n",

I feel like every recipe I find is either all bacon, or all cheese. Which are both SUPER high in calories. \\nWhere are the resources for low cal, healthy keto?!

I am definitely in a caloric deficit so idk what’s going on.  Does anyone know why I might be stalling despite the large calorie defect.   \n",

It's super convenient, low in carbs, and seems like a fairly nutrient dense food (as opposed to shirataki rice, for example which has nothing in it besides fiber and water).\\n\\nHowever, I’m concerned a little bit about oxylates and their ability to chelate other minerals and remove them from your body. I know that you can greatly diminish the oxylates by steaming or cooking – but that diminishes the ease of use, and I frankly don’t like cooked spinach as much as raw.\\n\\nBut, here’s my question, given the fact that spinach is so naturally high in minerals – like iron, magnesium, etc. – I’m wondering if the oxylates could be pretty much already be bound to plenty of minerals already? So, while maybe you aren’t getting the full value of the iron from the spinach, for example, it’s not like you are depleting other iron from what you are eating?   \n",

       "1987  i was first diagnosed with type 2 diabetes about 4 years ago  at the time i was really afraid  so i began researching the internet for the best diet to treat this disease which is when i first learned about keto  i was so impressed with the science behind it that i decided to give it a try  and it worked   it only took a day or two before i saw my glucose numbers drop to a normal range  the combination of lchf along with intermittent fasting and regular exercise worked like a charm  until i entered a long term depressive episode  unrelated to keto  and i stopped for about a year   the second time on keto was even better  i managed to bring my a1c down from 12 to 5 6  then  you guessed it  i fell into another year long depression and stopped again  i began a year long food indulgence spree and ate whatever i wanted  whenever i wanted  and now i fear the damage is too great to reverse   last week  i started to feel extremely weak  it was so concerning that i decided to check my blood sugar for the first time in over a year  the number i saw on the glucometer shocked me  423  i knew it would be high  but not that high  it was something i could no longer willfully ignore  and decided immediately to stop this vicious cycle i was putting myself through and return to keto   at first everything seemed to be going in the right direction  my blood sugar was still high  but in the 200s now instead of the 400s  i began omad if  my usual  and moderate exercise  basically  the same routine i had done twice before that seemed to work well for me    but after a full week of returning to a healthier lifestyle  i'm starting to feel defeated  i feel like the damage i've done to my body is too much and now it can't be fixed  i just cannot get my blood sugar below 200 anymore  before it was so easy to do  yesterday morning my glucose was at 234  and after drinking coffee with a tablespoon of heavy cream  it shot up to 320  this didn't make any sense to me  how can zero carbs cause such a dramatic insulin spike   this post is already way longer than i intended it to be  so i'll just end it here  i didn't really know where else to turn  i feel like giving up  because i feel like it's too late for me  but at the same time i know keto is the best thing for me  and i'm too scared to go to the doctor because i don't want to start taking insulin  i wanted to fix this on my own but i no longer believe that i can    \n",

       "      <td>I was first diagnosed with type 2 diabetes about 4 years ago. At the time I was really afraid, so I began researching the internet for the best diet to treat this disease which is when I first learned about keto. I was so impressed with the science behind it that I decided to give it a try. And it worked.\\n\\nIt only took a day or two before I saw my glucose numbers drop to a normal range. The combination of LCHF along with intermittent fasting and regular exercise worked like a charm. Until I entered a long-term depressive episode (unrelated to keto) and I stopped for about a year.\\n\\nThe second time on keto was even better. I managed to bring my A1C down from 12 to 5.6. Then, you guessed it, I fell into another year long depression and stopped again. I began a year long food indulgence spree and ate whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. And now I fear the damage is too great to reverse.\\n\\nLast week, I started to feel extremely weak. It was so concerning that I decided to check my blood sugar for the first time in over a year. The number I saw on the glucometer shocked me: 423. I knew it would be high, but not THAT high. It was something I could no longer willfully ignore, and decided immediately to stop this vicious cycle I was putting myself through and return to keto.\\n\\nAt first everything seemed to be going in the right direction. My blood sugar was still high, but in the 200s now instead of the 400s. I began OMAD IF (my usual) and moderate exercise. Basically, the same routine I had done twice before that seemed to work well for me. \\n\\nBut after a full week of returning to a healthier lifestyle, I'm starting to feel defeated. I feel like the damage I've done to my body is too much and now it can't be fixed. I just CANNOT get my blood sugar below 200 anymore. Before it was so easy to do. Yesterday morning my glucose was at 234, and after drinking coffee with a tablespoon of heavy cream, it shot up to 320. This didn't make any sense to me. How can zero carbs cause such a dramatic insulin spike?\\n\\nThis post is already way longer than I intended it to be, so I'll just end it here. I didn't really know where else to turn. I feel like giving up, because I feel like it's too late for me. But at the same time I know keto is the best thing for me. And I'm too scared to go to the doctor because I don't want to start taking insulin. I wanted to fix this on my own but I no longer believe that I can.</td>\n",

I feel like every recipe I find is either all bacon, or all cheese. Which are both SUPER high in calories. \\nWhere are the resources for low cal, healthy keto?!

I am definitely in a caloric deficit so idk what’s going on.  Does anyone know why I might be stalling despite the large calorie defect.   \n",

It's super convenient, low in carbs, and seems like a fairly nutrient dense food (as opposed to shirataki rice, for example which has nothing in it besides fiber and water).\\n\\nHowever, I’m concerned a little bit about oxylates and their ability to chelate other minerals and remove them from your body. I know that you can greatly diminish the oxylates by steaming or cooking – but that diminishes the ease of use, and I frankly don’t like cooked spinach as much as raw.\\n\\nBut, here’s my question, given the fact that spinach is so naturally high in minerals – like iron, magnesium, etc. – I’m wondering if the oxylates could be pretty much already be bound to plenty of minerals already? So, while maybe you aren’t getting the full value of the iron from the spinach, for example, it’s not like you are depleting other iron from what you are eating?   \n",

       "1002  i was first diagnosed with type 2 diabetes about 4 years ago  at the time i was really afraid  so i began researching the internet for the best diet to treat this disease which is when i first learned about keto  i was so impressed with the science behind it that i decided to give it a try  and it worked   it only took a day or two before i saw my glucose numbers drop to a normal range  the combination of lchf along with intermittent fasting and regular exercise worked like a charm  until i entered a long term depressive episode  unrelated to keto  and i stopped for about a year   the second time on keto was even better  i managed to bring my a1c down from 12 to 5 6  then  you guessed it  i fell into another year long depression and stopped again  i began a year long food indulgence spree and ate whatever i wanted  whenever i wanted  and now i fear the damage is too great to reverse   last week  i started to feel extremely weak  it was so concerning that i decided to check my blood sugar for the first time in over a year  the number i saw on the glucometer shocked me  423  i knew it would be high  but not that high  it was something i could no longer willfully ignore  and decided immediately to stop this vicious cycle i was putting myself through and return to keto   at first everything seemed to be going in the right direction  my blood sugar was still high  but in the 200s now instead of the 400s  i began omad if  my usual  and moderate exercise  basically  the same routine i had done twice before that seemed to work well for me    but after a full week of returning to a healthier lifestyle  i'm starting to feel defeated  i feel like the damage i've done to my body is too much and now it can't be fixed  i just cannot get my blood sugar below 200 anymore  before it was so easy to do  yesterday morning my glucose was at 234  and after drinking coffee with a tablespoon of heavy cream  it shot up to 320  this didn't make any sense to me  how can zero carbs cause such a dramatic insulin spike   this post is already way longer than i intended it to be  so i'll just end it here  i didn't really know where else to turn  i feel like giving up  because i feel like it's too late for me  but at the same time i know keto is the best thing for me  and i'm too scared to go to the doctor because i don't want to start taking insulin  i wanted to fix this on my own but i no longer believe that i can    \n",

       "      <td>The whole world is now combating a common problem of human life called [obesity](https://www.fitex.club/some-unknown-things-about-weight-loss-you-should-know/). Almost every person in this world is concerned about the extra weight of their body. Thus they are trying their level best to get rid of the extra pounds and they are adopting several ways to reach their target. Some are taking the route of hard exercising, some are going through [yoga](https://www.fitex.club/embrace-your-body-with-3-yoga-poses/). But there is another way through which you can get rid of the extra fats of your body. Here you need to adjust your diet plan a bit and increase the intake of protein food by reducing the carbohydrates. During this diet plan, you will be given a very little amount of carbohydrates and the same will be replaced by fat and protein. Since you are reducing the carbohydrate intake in your body, it will get to a metabolic state which is named Ketosis.\\n\\n**What Is a** [**Keto Diet**](https://www.fitex.club/what-are-the-dangers-of-the-keto-diet/)**?**\\n\\nA question may arise about what is a Keto diet. Normally a person takes 50 to 60% of the carbohydrates of his daily meal. But in the case of the Keto diet, you cannot consume that much carbohydrate. As carbohydrate is the main source of energy of our body, it protects the fat content to generate energy in the body. While you reduce the consumption of carbohydrates drastically, the body breaks down the fat cells to make the necessary energy for its physical and physiological works. During the Keto diet, you can only take 30 to 50 grams of carbohydrates so that the blood [sugar](https://www.fitex.club/unhealthy-fat-deposits-around-heart-from-too-much-sugar/) level does not fall and you don’t get sick. The required energy of the body will be generated by oxidizing the fat cell and it will cause you to shred the excess amount of fat in your body. In a Keto diet plan, almost 50% of the meal contains protein and the rest are made of fat and the least amount of carbs. People who want to shred their extra pounds quickly and effectively can adopt this diet plan. Basically, a Keto diet plan is for a month after that you will have to take a short break of nearly one week and then again you can go for the second phase of your Keto diet plan.\\n\\nA Ketogenic diet is basically a form of diet that does not have the responsibility to give you proper health. It is only used to lose weight early. People who are suffering from cardiac problems, certain brain diseases, and have problems with acne are advised to stay away from this kind of diet. Since the heavy fat content can increase the problems as well. Though this diet is all about reducing the intake of carbohydrates it eventually increases the intake of fat through different foods like butter, oil, and cheese. This is why you require taking proper advice from your doctor as well as a diet expert on whether you can go for this diet plan or not. Without knowing the proper ways of adapting to this diet plan can cause you heavy harm. Eventually, there are some side effects of this diet, and people who are capable of tolerating these things can go for or other specific kinds of diet plans.\\n\\n**Preparation Before You Start a Keto Diet**\\n\\nChanging to a different type of diet system requires some preparation of the body. You can’t switch over to a different kind of food plan suddenly as the body requires getting adapted with it. First of all, you need to start with the basics of the Keto diet. It may cause you some uncomfortable moments first up but slowly and gradually it will get adjusted. Since the Keto diet is targeted to reduce the carb intake in your daily meal, there will be less than 30 grams of carbs daily in your diet. The lack of carbs will be fulfilled by the intake of fats. As carbs are the sources of energy for the physiological and physical functions of the body, you require some substitute to cover the lack. Fat is a very good source of energy in the body and in absence of carbs, it will oxidize to generate energy in your body. So your meals should be filled with meat, cheese, nuts, oilseeds, eggs, and other sources of fats. The same amount of fat gives double energy than that of carbs and thus you need to put some low-calorie vegetables in your daily meal.\\n\\nDuring the Keto diet, you should keep some important aspects of it in mind. You will not get that much low-carb food here and there and thus you need to carry your snacks wherever you are going. It will cause you a sense of unfulfillment many a time after you eat meals as carbs help to secrete the hormone that gives you the signal that you are done with your food. Taking too much protein diet will definitely cause you some change in the chemical as well as fluid balance in your body. It will also affect the balance of minerals in your body too. There you may have to take enough salt as well as electrolytes from outside too to keep your body hydrated. If you want your Keto diet to work faster, then you can use some Keto salt supplements too. There may be several obstacles in your road to [weight loss](https://www.fitex.club/healthy-weight-loss-diet-within-budget/) through the Keto diet, but you need to stay focused and not lose hope.\\n\\n**Things That You Can Take during Your Keto Diet**\\n\\nSince you are not taking carbs in ample amounts, you need to take such foods that will keep you filled. Without a proper amount of food you may feel starving as well as due to lack of satisfaction after eating, you may have mood swings as well. So here are some of the best foods that you can eat during your Keto diet.\\n\\n**1. Meat**\\n\\nMeat is a very good source of protein. It will help you to build your muscles and shred extra fats in your body. There are varieties of meat that are available in the market. Most people who are on the journey of weight loss try to avoid red meat like mutton, beef, pork, and so on. But here in the Keto diet, you can easily go for all kinds of meats. In other weight-loss diets, the experts recommend only boiled meat so that no extra oil can get in. but in this case, you can go for your favorite dishes made of chicken or mutton or beef and no one is going to stop you since along with protein, you also need ample amounts of fat too.\\n\\n**2. Fish**\\n\\nSea fishes can be very good sources of high protein and essential fatty acids. They are actually very tasty and are very good for heart health. On the other hand, it will provide the necessary amount of protein as well as fat content required for the Keto diet plan. Salmon, tuna, mackerel, trout can be very good options for those who are going through their Keto diet plan.\\n\\n**3. Dairy Products**\\n\\nMilk and dairy products are very essential in this case of diet. Milk contains almost all kinds of micro-nutrients which are really necessary. It also will give you some amount of carbs along with fat too. Other than that, cheese, butter, and creams can be beneficial for the person going through the Keto diet.\\n\\n**4. Nuts and Oilseeds**\\n\\nThese are very important parts of the Keto diet since they contain essential fat contents for your health. Almonds, walnuts, cashew, peanut along with flaxseed, pumpkin seeds are very healthy ingredients in Keto diets. You can take them through your meal as they will provide you the necessary amount of good fats to keep your internal organs healthy.\\n\\n**5. Vegetables**\\n\\nFilled with vitamins and minerals, vegetables are very much needed for those who are going through the Keto diet. Vegetables will keep your stomach full and the dietary fibers present in them will definitely keep your stomach healthy. Vegetables of different colors will provide you different types of vitamins as well as minerals too. On the other hand, they will give you some amount of carbohydrates as well. If you are looking for some change of test of your mouth, then these veggies will definitely provide you with a different kind of test.\\n\\n**Foods That You Should Avoid during the Keto Diet**\\n\\nWhen you are going through a Keto diet you need to take proper food enriched in protein and fat but the only thing you should avoid is carbohydrates. Most of the snacks available in the market are full of carbohydrates. Though there are different types of carbohydrates, still the snacks are mostly made of simple carbs that get into the body and assimilate easily to release energy. This is why they get digested quickly and you feel hungry soon after you finish the snacks. Some of the foods that you should strictly avoid if you are going through your Keto diet plan are mentioned here.\\n\\nThe first thing that comes on the list is bread and bakery foods. Bread is one of the steady foods of our [daily life](https://www.fitex.club/this-is-how-you-can-incorporate-healthy-activities-into-your-daily-life/). It is a good source of carbohydrates that helps you to generate energy for all your works. This is why consuming bread and bakery products, diet crackers, cookies are strictly forbidden in the Keto diet plans. The second thing that should be avoided is sweet and sugary foods. Sweets are full of sugar and sugar is the finest form of carbs. This is why you need to avoid sugar and sweet foods very strictly. Sweetened beverages contain a high amount of sugar so you need to stay away from soda, different kinds of packaged fruit juices, sweetened tea, and soft drinks.\\n\\nOn the other hand Spaghetti, noodles, wheat, rice, cereals, potatoes, corn, peas, pumpkin, black beans, chickpeas, citrus fruits like oranges, grapes, pineapples, and most importantly alcoholic drinks should be avoided if you want to get your body fat free really. There are different kinds of fats too that you should not consume during your Keto diet like margarine, vegetable oils, and so on when you are taking protein as the major contributor to your meal you should definitely try to have fresh meat. Processed and packaged meat is very much unhealthy and will disturb your goal of losing weight.\\n\\nSo far we were discussing the foods that we should avoid during the Keto diet plan. But there are some foods that we can easily take. These foods contain healthy fat in good proportion and thus you can consume them to keep your body healthy. There are some supplements that you can take like exogenous Ketone supplements. This is nothing but some extra amount of Ketones that you provide to your body from outside. Medium-chain triglycerides give the Ketones a boost to keep your body healthy.\\n\\nThey are also beneficial in terms of losing weight, gaining energy for your daily works as well as they help in digestion also. There are some snack options too for the people who are going through the Keto diet. Almonds and cheese are very good sources of healthy fat for the body. Avocado with chicken salad, unsweetened coconut, nuts and seeds, half-boiled eggs, olives, and salami berries can be good snack options for you so that you don’t feel starved while you are traveling or you are out of your home for a longer period of time.\\n\\n**Benefits of Keto Diet**\\n\\n1. The lower the number of carbs in the diet, the lower the appetite will be. The experts say that sugary and carbohydrate foods increase the appetite. Hunger is the enemy of your diet plan and thus if you will go for a Keto diet, then you will feel less hungry.\\n\\n2. While you will lower the number of carbs in your meal, it will cause drastic weight loss at the start of the diet plan. As we all know that carbs are the fuel of our body and thus while there is less supply of carbs in the body, it will use the fat to generate the energy for the physical or physiological works of the body. This will cause faster shredding of fats from the body.\\n\\n3. Like in nature, in our body also, there are different types of fats available. There are different sites where the fats are stored. The risk of health is thus determined by the deposition of the fats inside the body. Mostly the fats deposited in the lower abdomen are very harmful. This fat is very rigid and thus is the reason for obesity. While you lower the number of carbs in your diet, you will notice that the fat stored in the lower abdomen is getting shredded very fast. The fat which is used to generate energy in absence of carbs is generally supplied from this portion of the body.\\n\\n4. While you lower the amount of carb intake in your body, the triglyceride content of the blood falls. It is the fat molecules that move through the body along with the blood through the blood vessels. Thus it reduces the risk of different diseases and you can stay safe from the dangers of blockage of the blood vessels.\\n\\n5. High-density lipoprotein is a very healthy fat content of the body. While you decrease the amount of carb intake, it gradually increases the HDL level in the body. It keeps the heart healthy and protects the other organs from danger.\\n\\n6. As soon as you decrease your intake of carbs, it causes a lower level of sugar in your blood. Lower sugar level thus causes lowering the insulin levels. The Keto diet is thus very helpful for those who have blood sugar.\\n\\n7. It also brings the blood pressure under control as increased carbohydrate is the cause of elevated blood pressure too.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hey all! Before I get started, apologies for the format of this. I'm not super good at organizing my thoughts but I wanted to share my journey and the insights that have come to me along the way. Hopefully this is all decipherable. \\n\\nTo begin with - I started my keto journey in late 2018 at a starting weight of 155 lbs and a goal weight of 110 lbs. I am 32F, 5'1\". See pictures in the imgur link at the bottom. NOTE: from the pictures 110 might be a little thin for me, but my rationale was that I might gain a lot of water weight and bounce back to 115 which I think is a maintainable weight that I would be really happy with. So that's how I came to my goal. \\n\\nOver the course of the next year and change, I lost a total of 39 pounds getting to a low weight of 116 pounds. Around January 2020, I took a 1 month keto break and went back up to 120. Staying on the horse after this break was difficult, and ultimately I fell off entirely when the pandemic hit. I ended up gaining 20 pounds back to 140.\\n\\nWell New Year's came around, and I resolved to get back to my original goal weight of 110 lbs. \\n\\nI was pretty mad at myself that I let myself slip so much and let all that hard work go to waste, so I set a really aggressive goal of 2 lbs per week. Barring 1 or 2 bad weeks, I have kept up with this so far! It is now the end of Week 11 and I have lost 17 lbs. I definitely noticed I have lost weight a lot faster this time around. I don't believe it is because \"it's my second time\", but rather some key differences in the way I decided to approach Keto the second time and I'd like to share these with you.\\n\\nPre-Keto habits:\\n\\n* **I was a fairly gluttonous person** with poor meal portion awareness/control. I just wanted to stuff my face all day everyday with my favorite foods, it was the most amazing and soothing feeling in the world.\\n* I lived for carbs. Pasta, pizza and potato chips specifically\\n* I loathed exercise\\n\\nKeto first round (2018-2019) philosophy (**AKA THINGS NOT TO DO, even though I lost 39 lbs on it**):\\n\\n* Diets had always failed for me, because I just wanted to always shove food in my mouth. I think the reason Keto initially worked for me was because, I figured out that as long as something had next to 0 carbs in it, I could basically eat as much as I wanted and still lose weight. This was basically a miracle diet for me. I made a list of foods that I didn't want to go without, found the ones that had very, very few carbs, and just shoveled those things into my face 24/7. In hindsight, this was really unhealthy but ultimately it got the ball rolling. But the takeaway is, **Keto initially worked for me because I was able to continue feeding my glutton habit.** \\n* Toward the end of 2019, I was really beginning to crave carbs and would get sloppier and sloppier with takeout meals and cheat snacks. My rationale was \"the more fat I eat, the more carbs I can eat since really carb quota is based on percentage of total macros\". This led to **more snowballing with the gluttony**, and I found myself eating massive amounts of fat everyday to justify going up to 30 or 40 grams of carbs. I'm not sure if this logic actually holds true for Keto. I didn't gain weight, but I didn't lose weight either - probably due to the sheer calories in to calories out ratio.\\n* In the second half of 2019 I began to rely heavily on highly processed keto substitutes, what I call fake foods: products with wheat or milk protein isolate that mimicked puffy grains and cereals, baked goods such as cookies, brownies and cakes with fake sugar and almond/coconut flours, and substitute breads, such as almond meal bread, cloud bread, and whatever voodoo magic ThinSlim's breads are made of. At some point, my diet consisted of 80% or more of these packaged keto substitute fake foods, and I was barely even eating any veggies or meat. Once again, **my gluttonous tendencies had taken over** but this time I was trying to just eat as much comforting processed, easy-to-binge foods as possible. \\n* I didn't have an exit strategy. My exit during January 2020 was basically, \"I miss carbs and I'm going to try to binge on them like crazy for a month to get the urge out of the way.\" Yeah, right cadonana. This was dangerous, self-enabling, excuse-riddled talk. I never thought ahead to what my regular diet might look like after I hit my goal weight or came off keto. Heavens knows that the way I was eating was absolutely not healthy or sustainable, despite the fact that I was losing weight.\\n\\nQueue the pandemic. Welllllll, old and constant friend Gluttony, let's see how we did:\\n\\n* Absolutely just started eating my feelings and bingeing every processed comfort food in sight, in mass quantities. I'd run to the drug store in my PPE and clean out the kettle chips shelf once a week. Sometimes I'd sit in front of the TV and eat 2 bags of chips in one sitting. Rice, ramen, mac and cheese, pizza, oh my gosh. I'm surprised I didn't get diabetes during the pandemic. \\n* I was also \"gluttonous\" in other ways. My retail therapy spending got out of control, and I found my front door being piled with packages of useless crap over the past year.\\n\\nHello 2021! Time for fresh starts and healthier perspectives. Well obviously, something had had to change. I had ballooned out to 140 lbs again. I was no longer fitting the new wardrobe I had bought myself in 2019. My bank account was drained. I was sleeping whenever possible, just barely doing the things I needed to. It was a pretty dark time for me. I felt like crap, physically and mentally. \\n\\nJanuary 1st came around, and I resolved the next day I would stop shoveling mac and cheese into my piehole and start taking care of myself more. \\n\\nHere are the things I did differently the second time around:\\n\\n* As mentioned before, I was pretty mad at myself and set an aggressive goal of 2 lbs per week. What really surprised me, 3 months in, is that I was able to more or less stick to this so far.\\n* I made a nifty chart (see link below) to track my progress and came up with some rewards for myself. I think this tracking chart actually helped my motivation immensely. It's so satisfying when I hit a day where I can color in another block! Note that I also laminated the chart, so I can erase progress in case I'm bad and gain weight again, haha. \\n* Ironically, my severe spending habit in 2020 helped me in a way: In addition to starting up Keto again, I had put myself on a rather strict budget and savings goal for 2021. This helped me so much because I simply couldn't afford all those expensive, pre-packaged Keto fake foods that I had binged on so much in the year before. **I think the presence of really comforting, \"yummy\" foods in my cabinet really contributed to a binge addiction in 2019 for me**. \\n* I'm focusing now on SIMPLE meals, 1) because I can't afford anything fancy or takeout right now, and b) I don't enjoy cooking and am too depressed/don't otherwise have energy to sink into preparing a nice meal. I think this, in combination with the lack of packaged fake foods, has really calmed down my so-called \"glutton response\". \\n* Every now and then I do some meal prep and create some very tasty, complex keto dishes. Some examples are shirataki alfredo, or paneer tikka masala. However, I found that eating these foods completely triggered my glutton response. On the days I made these meals for myself, I would portion out enough for a whole work week but then eat it all in two days. **I just could not help myself with these more complex, savory meals. I would crave the flavor and the mouth feel so much that I literally could not stop myself from going back to the fridge for more**. In contrast, if I eat a simple meal of lightly seasoned roasted or steamed veggies with some simply cooked chicken for example, **I would always be satisfied with the portion I originally set for myself**. \\n* The above 3 bullet points led me to realize that after all this time, after the 17 lbs I lost in 2021 and extreme self control I have exercised so far, **I still have an enormous psychological issue with food**. Okay, I know this was pretty obvious in hindsight, but I just couldn't define it well in my head. Maybe it's an addition to certain flavors or textures, maybe it's trying to fill the emotional void I feel with delicious foods. But now that I realized that, I'm going to avoid what I call \"complex meals\" (highly seasoned and well textured) until I can work with to figure out how to break the addiction. I will begin to work with a therapist soon on these issues!\\n* That being said, I do treat myself with a small packaged keto brownie every day or other day if I can afford to get some that week. But I make sure to get a bunch of one type at a time. This way I get sick of having the same treat every single day and it reduces my urge to binge, lol\\n* The last and (what I think is) most important point that I want to make is, that it is so, so, so much easier to restrict calories to a normal amount (as opposed to bingeing thousands of calories of fat) when you are not tempting yourself with your addictions all the time. Cramming your face with fat all the time for sustained period is not the way to go, like I did the first time. Sure, the benefit of losing weight more quickly right now is great because I am eating balanced (well, keto-balanced - still eating that scoop of cream cheese at the end of everyday to get my fat macros in), whole/real-food meals. But I'm realizing this is just so much healthier. I feel great, I have energy, I am happy with my weight loss. But most importantly, **I believe now that I can transition from this to a sustainable, permanent, healthy lifestyle after I come off keto**. I have identified a major psychological issue that I am going to address which will help me sustain a new lifestyle after I hit my goal weight. Because let's be real, life is better with carbs - but I only deserve them if I can stop myself from out of control shoving them in my face. And I believe I can achieve this.  \\n\\nNext steps, and I think this is SO IMPORTANT!!!: **come up with an exit plan and permanent, healthy, maintainable lifestyle change for after I hit my weight goal.** Let's be honest. I love carbs. This second round of Keto has made me realize that I can have a healthy lifestyle of enjoying carbs for the rest of my life AND maintain the weight I want, if I only address my binge eating issues. I haven't come up with this plan yet, but on my list is:\\n\\n* Experimenting in the weeks and months after I exit keto to find out what my ideal \"maintain weight\" calories/macros are, and factoring \"feeling good\" and \"having energy\" heavily into this. \\n* Aggressively working on my bingeing issues in talk therapy. \\n* Figuring out how to eat delicious foods that I'm likely to binge, without getting to that point\\n* Fun and maintainable exercise: A strength building routine, and finding a type of cardio that I don't hate. \\n\\nIf you read all this, thank you! Again, sorry about the length and formatting/organization. I hope this helps people regardless!!\\n\\n[See pictures of my progress and keto tracker here!](https://imgur.com/a/K1mex0m)\\n\\n**tl;dr** \\n\\n* Eat real, whole foods during keto. Don't cheat with fake sugars, isolates. Rewarding occasionally is okay but be strict about how much you eat!\\n* This will help you with portion control and listen to your body to actually know when to stop eating. \\n* Progress tracking charts are fun, helpful, and very motivational.\\n* Do some introspection and try to figure out your issues with food. This helped me discover a huge psychological issue I have with bingeing food and I'm going to get help in therapy for it now. \\n* Now that I have discovered these things, I have so much hope that I can sustain a healthy diet  after I hit my goal weight and enjoy carbs/life in a healthy way!</td>\n",

along the way  hopefully this is all decipherable    to begin with   i started my keto journey in late 2018 at a starting weight of 155 lbs and a goal weight of 110 lbs  i am 32f  5'1   see pictures in the imgur link at the bottom  note  from the pictures 110 might be a little thin for me  but my rationale was that i might gain a lot of water weight and bounce back to 115 which i think is a maintainable weight that i would be really happy with  so that's how i came to my goal    over the course of the next year and change  i lost a total of 39 pounds getting to a low weight of 116 pounds  around january 2020  i took a 1 month keto break and went back up to 120  staying on the horse after this break was difficult  and ultimately i fell off entirely when the pandemic hit  i ended up gaining 20 pounds back to 140   well new year's came around  and i resolved to get back to my original goal weight of 110 lbs    i was pretty mad at myself that i let myself slip so much and let all that hard work go to waste  so i set a really aggressive goal of 2 lbs per week  barring 1 or 2 bad weeks  i have kept up with this so far  it is now the end of week 11 and i have lost 17 lbs  i definitely noticed i have lost weight a lot faster this time around  i don't believe it is because  it's my second time   but rather some key differences in the way i decided to approach keto the second time and i'd like to share these with you   pre keto habits       i was a fairly gluttonous person   with poor meal portion awareness control  i just wanted to stuff my face all day everyday with my favorite foods  it was the most amazing and soothing feeling in the world    i lived for carbs  pasta  pizza and potato chips specifically   i loathed exercise  keto first round  2018 2019  philosophy    aka things not to do  even though i lost 39 lbs on it        diets had always failed for me  because i just wanted to always shove food in my mouth  i think the reason keto initially worked for me was because  i figured out that as long as something had next to 0 carbs in it  i could basically eat as much as i wanted and still lose weight  this was basically a miracle diet for me  i made a list of foods that i didn't want to go without  found the ones that had very  very few carbs  and just shoveled those things into my face 24 7  in hindsight  this was really unhealthy but ultimately it got the ball rolling  but the takeaway is    keto initially worked for me because i was able to continue feeding my glutton habit       toward the end of 2019  i was really beginning to crave carbs and would get sloppier and sloppier with takeout meals and cheat snacks  my rationale was  the more fat i eat  the more carbs i can eat since really carb quota is based on percentage of total macros   this led to   more snowballing with the gluttony    and i found myself eating massive amounts of fat everyday to justify going up to 30 or 40 grams of carbs  i'm not sure if this logic actually holds true for keto  i didn't gain weight  but i didn't lose weight either   probably due to the sheer calories in to calories out ratio    in the second half of 2019 i began to rely heavily on highly processed keto substitutes  what i call fake foods  products with wheat or milk protein isolate that mimicked puffy grains and cereals  baked goods such as cookies  brownies and cakes with fake sugar and almond coconut flours  and substitute breads  such as almond meal bread  cloud bread  and whatever voodoo magic thinslim's breads are made of  at some point  my diet consisted of 80  or more of these packaged keto substitute fake foods  and i was barely even eating any veggies or meat  once again    my gluttonous tendencies had taken over   but this time i was trying to just eat as much comforting processed  easy to binge foods as possible     i didn't have an exit strategy  my exit during january 2020 was basically   i miss carbs and i'm going to try to binge on them like crazy for a month to get the urge out of the way   yeah  right cadonana  this was dangerous  self enabling  excuse riddled talk  i never thought ahead to what my regular diet might look like after i hit my goal weight or came off keto  heavens knows that the way i was eating was absolutely not healthy or sustainable  despite the fact that i was losing weight   queue the pandemic  welllllll  old and constant friend gluttony  let's see how we did     absolutely just started eating my feelings and bingeing every processed comfort food in sight  in mass quantities  i'd run to the drug store in my ppe and clean out the kettle chips shelf once a week  sometimes i'd sit in front of the tv and eat 2 bags of chips in one sitting  rice  ramen  mac and cheese  pizza  oh my gosh  i'm surprised i didn't get diabetes during the pandemic     i was also  gluttonous  in other ways  my retail therapy spending got out of control  and i found my front door being piled with packages of useless crap over the past year   hello 2021  time for fresh starts and healthier perspectives  well obviously  something had had to change  i had ballooned out to 140 lbs again  i was no longer fitting the new wardrobe i had bought myself in 2019  my bank account was drained  i was sleeping whenever possible  just barely doing the things i needed to  it was a pretty dark time for me  i felt like crap  physically and mentally    january 1st came around  and i resolved the next day i would stop shoveling mac and cheese into my piehole and start taking care of myself more    here are the things i did differently the second time around     as mentioned before  i was pretty mad at myself and set an aggressive goal of 2 lbs per week  what really surprised me  3 months in  is that i was able to more or less stick to this so far    i made a nifty chart  see link below  to track my progress and came up with some rewards for myself  i think this tracking chart actually helped my motivation immensely  it's so satisfying when i hit a day where i can color in another block  note that i also laminated the chart  so i can erase progress in case i'm bad and gain weight again  haha     ironically  my severe spending habit in 2020 helped me in a way  in addition to starting up keto again  i had put myself on a rather strict budget and savings goal for 2021  this helped me so much because i simply couldn't afford all those expensive  pre packaged keto fake foods that i had binged on so much in the year before    i think the presence of really comforting   yummy  foods in my cabinet really contributed to a binge addiction in 2019 for me       i'm focusing now on simple meals  1  because i can't afford anything fancy or takeout right now  and b  i don't enjoy cooking and am too depressed don't otherwise have energy to sink into preparing a nice meal  i think this  in combination with the lack of packaged fake foods  has really calmed down my so called  glutton response      every now and then i do some meal prep and create some very tasty  complex keto dishes  some examples are shirataki alfredo  or paneer tikka masala  however  i found that eating these foods completely triggered my glutton response  on the days i made these meals for myself  i would portion out enough for a whole work week but then eat it all in two days    i just could not help myself with these more complex  savory meals  i would crave the flavor and the mouth feel so much that i literally could not stop myself from going back to the fridge for more    in contrast  if i eat a simple meal of lightly seasoned roasted or steamed veggies with some simply cooked chicken for example    i would always be satisfied with the portion i originally set for myself       the above 3 bullet points led me to realize that after all this time  after the 17 lbs i lost in 2021 and extreme self control i have exercised so far    i still have an enormous psychological issue with food    okay  i know this was pretty obvious in hindsight  but i just couldn't define it well in my head  maybe it's an addition to certain flavors or textures  maybe it's trying to fill the emotional void i feel with delicious foods  but now that i realized that  i'm going to avoid what i call  complex meals   highly seasoned and well textured  until i can work with to figure out how to break the addiction  i will begin to work with a therapist soon on these issues    that being said  i do treat myself with a small packaged keto brownie every day or other day if i can afford to get some that week  but i make sure to get a bunch of one type at a time  this way i get sick of having the same treat every single day and it reduces my urge to binge  lol   the last and  what i think is  most important point that i want to make is  that it is so  so  so much easier to restrict calories to a normal amount  as opposed to bingeing thousands of calories of fat  when you are not tempting yourself with your addictions all the time  cramming your face with fat all the time for sustained period is not the way to go  like i did the first time  sure  the benefit of losing weight more quickly right now is great because i am eating balanced  well  keto balanced   still eating that scoop of cream cheese at the end of everyday to get my fat macros in   whole real food meals  but i'm realizing this is just so much healthier  i feel great  i have energy  i am happy with my weight loss  but most importantly    i believe now that i can transition from this to a sustainable  permanent  healthy lifestyle after i come off keto    i have identified a major psychological issue that i am going to address which will help me sustain a new lifestyle after i hit my goal weight  because let's be real  life is better with carbs   but i only deserve them if i can stop myself from out of control shoving them in my face  and i believe i can achieve this     next steps  and i think this is so important       come up with an exit plan and permanent  healthy  maintainable lifestyle change for after i hit my weight goal    let's be honest  i love carbs  this second round of keto has made me realize that i can have a healthy lifestyle of enjoying carbs for the rest of my life and maintain the weight i want  if i only address my binge eating issues  i haven't come up with this plan yet  but on my list is     experimenting in the weeks and months after i exit keto to find out what my ideal  maintain weight  calories macros are  and factoring  feeling good  and  having energy  heavily into this     aggressively working on my bingeing issues in talk therapy     figuring out how to eat delicious foods that i'm likely to binge  without getting to that point   fun and maintainable exercise  a strength building routine  and finding a type of cardio that i don't hate    if you read all this  thank you  again  sorry about the length and formatting organization  i hope this helps people regardless     see pictures of my progress and keto tracker here   https   imgur com a k1mex0m     tl dr       eat real  whole foods during keto  don't cheat with fake sugars  isolates  rewarding occasionally is okay but be strict about how much you eat    this will help you with portion control and listen to your body to actually know when to stop eating     progress tracking charts are fun  helpful  and very motivational    do some introspection and try to figure out your issues with food  this helped me discover a huge psychological issue i have with bingeing food and i'm going to get help in therapy for it now     now that i have discovered these things  i have so much hope that i can sustain a healthy diet  after i hit my goal weight and enjoy carbs life in a healthy way</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hey everyone,\\n\\nI'm M46, having struggled for the vast majority of my life with my weight, going up to 330lbs at my peak in my late 20s, yo yo-ing up and down, stabilizing at about \\~275 for a few years until I decided about 15 years ago to go through bariatric surgery and get a lap band. That helped me out for a while, bringing my weight down to about 225, but I was building a ton of muscle at that point, going to the gym 5 days a week for a mix of light cardio and strength. And then, of course, \"life got in the way\". I work in tech, which meant long hours, grabbing whatever I could eat, and things crept up.\\n\\nOver the last 20 years, I've also been suffering from mild clinical depression. Nothing crazy, but enough to add to the \"uggggggghh\" aspect of life and exercise, and coming up with excuses not to do X, Y, or Z. Unsurprisingly, things were a lot better during my \"healthy\" period, and my psychiatrist has often recommended focusing on my weight loss to get better. Easier said than done, especially when living in my head!\\n\\nThe challenge for me has been trust, and accountability. I'm married, with 2 kids, and am the cook of the house. My wife has known me forever (40+ years), and has seen me through all of my phases. I love her to death, and I know she means well, but she can be very judgmental, and over the years, I've lost my ability to have a proper discussion around anything regarding my health, or weight. I just get incredibly defensive, and change the subject.\\n\\nI've also tried, and somewhat successfully lost a decent chunk of weight. A few years back, I got into golfing (after years of making fun of my parents), and started WW at the time and dropped a good 25lbs in a few weeks. But I would do all of this avoiding conversations with the family, or even mentioning I was doing it. Given I'm the cook in the house, it didn't lead to good, sustaining results. This accountability problem didn't just lie with how I interacted with my family, heck, my feeling of repeated failure kept pushing me to delay visits to doctors for checkups, and given my family has a long history of diabetes, and some heart disease, it was incredibly irresponsible. I'm a walking heart attack waiting to happen. I'd always push my reminders out a few months until \"I'd lose enough weight to have some good news to give my dr as she gave me the look of disappointment.\".\\n\\nA few months back, I realized that a year of quarantine killed what little exercise I was getting at work, and my days consisted of 10 hours on my desk chair, a few hours with the family, and then a few hours watching TV or back to work. My sleeping patterns were messed up because I'd choose to fall asleep on the couch, setting my alarm for \\~5am to then go up to bed, so my wife could get a really good night sleep without me snoring next to her (no sleep apnea, but boy, I can be a trumpet). My back is shot, I can barely walk straight, and am in constant pain. I'm an 80 year old man in a 40something body. The thought of the pandemic being over and the world going back to \"normal\" is both exciting, but also agonizing. No more excuses to do absolutely nothing.\\n\\nWhile my depression has always been fairly mild, I've lost family members to suicide, and would never ever every think of inflicting something like that on my own family and friends. But hey, if I died from a heart attack, would that be so bad? I felt like I hit rock bottom. \\n\\nI know it sounds dumb, but it took all my courage to sit down with my wife and tell her that it was time, I was seeking help, and that while I knew she meant well, I needed her to give me some room here. I'd tried keto a few times for short periods of time, and it suits me well in general as I'm not really a carbs person anyhow (but doing it in hiding is incredibly difficult...). I decided to bite the bullet, and sign up to Virta Health, buy a peloton, and say screw it - I'll be the guy who comes in 100 thousandth on leaderboards for a while, but I know I'll be better. Two things that work with me: accountability and gamification. Virta holds me accountable. No hiding, the coach is on you daily, everything's measured. It forced me to go to the dr and get results (and I'm just incredibly lucky that despite all the abuse my body has taken, my blood sugars and cholesterol numbers are high, but below any problematic numbers... Peloton, once I get started, gamifies things. I started on Duolingo learning Japanese a couple of years back for the fun of it, and not only kept going regardless of what was going on, but made me decide to take formal lessons and go to Japan. All that because of that damn streak :)\\n\\nI know all of this is irrelevant to all of you, but honestly, /r/keto has been an inspiration for the last few years, and seeing all of your stories was really the inspiration to get started. This is just the beginning, but I wanted to say thank you for nudging me to get on the bandwagon that I'm sure I'll fall off of, but get back on again. I owe it to myself, and my amazing family.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThank you all for making it this far.</td>\n",

I'm taking that as 10lbs water weight for the first week, and then about 1lb per week thereafter which is right on target. \\n\\nBut weightloss aside, I wanted to share how keto has positively affected me, to try and encourage others to stick it out, even if their weightloss journey has been a bit of a bumpy ride. \\n\\nJoint pain - As a young person, experiencing chronic severe joint pain in my fingers and moderate pain in one of my knees for the past few years was painful and frustrating. Before lockdown I went to trapeze and pole fitness classes twice a week, but falls on any of these areas would result in pain that would take weeks to subside. I was told my symptoms were typical of rheumatoid arthritis, but I'd have to go in for further tests to confirm this. Since swapping to keto, my finger pain has disappeared entirely, and my knee pain is barely there. I really believe in this diet for reducing inflammation.\\n\\nSpots / acne - In that same vein, the skin on my face has never been better. Whilst I only had mild acne on my cheeks, the overall quality of my skin was poor with it being bumpy, uneven, and red in places. The redness and spots have gone, and I cannot believe that the uneven texture I had, especially in places like my forehead where it's impossible to miss, has disappeared. \\n\\nFat and water deposits - The first major change I experienced when I lost the initial water weight was the change in skin quality of my thighs. I use to sit on the toilet and look down at my thighs and hate their appearance; not quite cellulite, but lumpy all the same. The skin there has now evened out and the lumps are gone. I wonder if this is where water was being retained unevenly in places between the skin and fat?  \\n\\nBloating - Before keto I was frequently bloated and had stomach pains due to 1) the food I was eating, and 2) a bad habit I had of swallowing air when I was hungry. Despite still drinking the likes of Coke Zero, I haven't experience any bloating or pain whilst on keto, and my better, more fulfilling meals are helping with my air swallowing habit. \\n\\nEnergy levels - I use to suffer from the post lunch slump and, as I'm currently working from home, would have to take a 2hr nap in the afternoon before returning to work. When I was working in the office, this would of course be impossible so my productivity would just cease to exist and I'd be sat at my desk managing to do next to no work. Happy to say that I've shockingly not had a single nap since starting keto. I'm able to go the entire day with my levels of productivity being pretty consistent throughout. \\n\\nBrain fog - Likewise, my brain fog has gone. I struggled focussing on tasks, and was frequently overwhelmed by large amounts of data (I create simulations for the oil and gas industry, so handle a lot of numbers). I feel like my mind is sharper now and I'm less likely to have my eyes \"glaze\" over. \\n\\nMood - I suffer from stress and anxiety. Whether it's just down to making a positive impact in my life, or whether it's the diet itself, I can't remember the last time I felt this good. I feel happy, optimistic and like a metaphorical weight has been lifted from me, even before the phsyical weight has gone. For the first time in 7 years, I'm starting to feel like I'm getting myself back. \\n\\nSleep - No more struggling to sleep. I'm getting a good, undisturbed night of sleep each night, and have gone from being that person who hits the snooze button on their alarm clock a million times, to waking up before my alarm. \\n\\nRelationship with food - I hated food. I was a high carb snack eater because I hated preparing meals. Now I actually enjoy the process of researching what I'm going to make, getting creative with recipes, and then getting hands on with making it. Keto's restrictions remove some of the overwhelming choice there is with food, and working within those confines actually makes it easier to come up with interesting dishes. \\n\\nHopefully some of my experience can act as motivation for others, so thanks for letting me share ☺️</td>\n",

       "149  The whole world is now combating a common problem of human life called [obesity](https://www.fitex.club/some-unknown-things-about-weight-loss-you-should-know/). Almost every person in this world is concerned about the extra weight of their body. Thus they are trying their level best to get rid of the extra pounds and they are adopting several ways to reach their target. Some are taking the route of hard exercising, some are going through [yoga](https://www.fitex.club/embrace-your-body-with-3-yoga-poses/). But there is another way through which you can get rid of the extra fats of your body. Here you need to adjust your diet plan a bit and increase the intake of protein food by reducing the carbohydrates. During this diet plan, you will be given a very little amount of carbohydrates and the same will be replaced by fat and protein. Since you are reducing the carbohydrate intake in your body, it will get to a metabolic state which is named Ketosis.\\n\\n**What Is a** [**Keto Diet**](https://www.fitex.club/what-are-the-dangers-of-the-keto-diet/)**?**\\n\\nA question may arise about what is a Keto diet. Normally a person takes 50 to 60% of the carbohydrates of his daily meal. But in the case of the Keto diet, you cannot consume that much carbohydrate. As carbohydrate is the main source of energy of our body, it protects the fat content to generate energy in the body. While you reduce the consumption of carbohydrates drastically, the body breaks down the fat cells to make the necessary energy for its physical and physiological works. During the Keto diet, you can only take 30 to 50 grams of carbohydrates so that the blood [sugar](https://www.fitex.club/unhealthy-fat-deposits-around-heart-from-too-much-sugar/) level does not fall and you don’t get sick. The required energy of the body will be generated by oxidizing the fat cell and it will cause you to shred the excess amount of fat in your body. In a Keto diet plan, almost 50% of the meal contains protein and the rest are made of fat and the least amount of carbs. People who want to shred their extra pounds quickly and effectively can adopt this diet plan. Basically, a Keto diet plan is for a month after that you will have to take a short break of nearly one week and then again you can go for the second phase of your Keto diet plan.\\n\\nA Ketogenic diet is basically a form of diet that does not have the responsibility to give you proper health. It is only used to lose weight early. People who are suffering from cardiac problems, certain brain diseases, and have problems with acne are advised to stay away from this kind of diet. Since the heavy fat content can increase the problems as well. Though this diet is all about reducing the intake of carbohydrates it eventually increases the intake of fat through different foods like butter, oil, and cheese. This is why you require taking proper advice from your doctor as well as a diet expert on whether you can go for this diet plan or not. Without knowing the proper ways of adapting to this diet plan can cause you heavy harm. Eventually, there are some side effects of this diet, and people who are capable of tolerating these things can go for or other specific kinds of diet plans.\\n\\n**Preparation Before You Start a Keto Diet**\\n\\nChanging to a different type of diet system requires some preparation of the body. You can’t switch over to a different kind of food plan suddenly as the body requires getting adapted with it. First of all, you need to start with the basics of the Keto diet. It may cause you some uncomfortable moments first up but slowly and gradually it will get adjusted. Since the Keto diet is targeted to reduce the carb intake in your daily meal, there will be less than 30 grams of carbs daily in your diet. The lack of carbs will be fulfilled by the intake of fats. As carbs are the sources of energy for the physiological and physical functions of the body, you require some substitute to cover the lack. Fat is a very good source of energy in the body and in absence of carbs, it will oxidize to generate energy in your body. So your meals should be filled with meat, cheese, nuts, oilseeds, eggs, and other sources of fats. The same amount of fat gives double energy than that of carbs and thus you need to put some low-calorie vegetables in your daily meal.\\n\\nDuring the Keto diet, you should keep some important aspects of it in mind. You will not get that much low-carb food here and there and thus you need to carry your snacks wherever you are going. It will cause you a sense of unfulfillment many a time after you eat meals as carbs help to secrete the hormone that gives you the signal that you are done with your food. Taking too much protein diet will definitely cause you some change in the chemical as well as fluid balance in your body. It will also affect the balance of minerals in your body too. There you may have to take enough salt as well as electrolytes from outside too to keep your body hydrated. If you want your Keto diet to work faster, then you can use some Keto salt supplements too. There may be several obstacles in your road to [weight loss](https://www.fitex.club/healthy-weight-loss-diet-within-budget/) through the Keto diet, but you need to stay focused and not lose hope.\\n\\n**Things That You Can Take during Your Keto Diet**\\n\\nSince you are not taking carbs in ample amounts, you need to take such foods that will keep you filled.

Vegetables will keep your stomach full and the dietary fibers present in them will definitely keep your stomach healthy. Vegetables of different colors will provide you different types of vitamins as well as minerals too. On the other hand, they will give you some amount of carbohydrates as well. If you are looking for some change of test of your mouth, then these veggies will definitely provide you with a different kind of test.\\n\\n**Foods That You Should Avoid during the Keto Diet**\\n\\nWhen you are going through a Keto diet you need to take proper food enriched in protein and fat but the only thing you should avoid is carbohydrates. Most of the snacks available in the market are full of carbohydrates. Though there are different types of carbohydrates, still the snacks are mostly made of simple carbs that get into the body and assimilate easily to release energy. This is why they get digested quickly and you feel hungry soon after you finish the snacks. Some of the foods that you should strictly avoid if you are going through your Keto diet plan are mentioned here.\\n\\nThe first thing that comes on the list is bread and bakery foods. Bread is one of the steady foods of our [daily life](https://www.fitex.club/this-is-how-you-can-incorporate-healthy-activities-into-your-daily-life/). It is a good source of carbohydrates that helps you to generate energy for all your works. This is why consuming bread and bakery products, diet crackers, cookies are strictly forbidden in the Keto diet plans. The second thing that should be avoided is sweet and sugary foods. Sweets are full of sugar and sugar is the finest form of carbs. This is why you need to avoid sugar and sweet foods very strictly. Sweetened beverages contain a high amount of sugar so you need to stay away from soda, different kinds of packaged fruit juices, sweetened tea, and soft drinks.\\n\\nOn the other hand Spaghetti, noodles, wheat, rice, cereals, potatoes, corn, peas, pumpkin, black beans, chickpeas, citrus fruits like oranges, grapes, pineapples, and most importantly alcoholic drinks should be avoided if you want to get your body fat free really. There are different kinds of fats too that you should not consume during your Keto diet like margarine, vegetable oils, and so on when you are taking protein as the major contributor to your meal you should definitely try to have fresh meat. Processed and packaged meat is very much unhealthy and will disturb your goal of losing weight.\\n\\nSo far we were discussing the foods that we should avoid during the Keto diet plan. But there are some foods that we can easily take. These foods contain healthy fat in good proportion and thus you can consume them to keep your body healthy. There are some supplements that you can take like exogenous Ketone supplements. This is nothing but some extra amount of Ketones that you provide to your body from outside. Medium-chain triglycerides give the Ketones a boost to keep your body healthy.\\n\\nThey are also beneficial in terms of losing weight, gaining energy for your daily works as well as they help in digestion also. There are some snack options too for the people who are going through the Keto diet. Almonds and cheese are very good sources of healthy fat for the body. Avocado with chicken salad, unsweetened coconut, nuts and seeds, half-boiled eggs, olives, and salami berries can be good snack options for you so that you don’t feel starved while you are traveling or you are out of your home for a longer period of time.\\n\\n**Benefits of Keto Diet**\\n\\n1. The lower the number of carbs in the diet, the lower the appetite will be. The experts say that sugary and carbohydrate foods increase the appetite. Hunger is the enemy of your diet plan and thus if you will go for a Keto diet, then you will feel less hungry.\\n\\n2. While you will lower the number of carbs in your meal, it will cause drastic weight loss at the start of the diet plan. As we all know that carbs are the fuel of our body and thus while there is less supply of carbs in the body, it will use the fat to generate the energy for the physical or physiological works of the body. This will cause faster shredding of fats from the body.\\n\\n3. Like in nature, in our body also, there are different types of fats available. There are different sites where the fats are stored. The risk of health is thus determined by the deposition of the fats inside the body. Mostly the fats deposited in the lower abdomen are very harmful. This fat is very rigid and thus is the reason for obesity. While you lower the number of carbs in your diet, you will notice that the fat stored in the lower abdomen is getting shredded very fast. The fat which is used to generate energy in absence of carbs is generally supplied from this portion of the body.\\n\\n4. While you lower the amount of carb intake in your body, the triglyceride content of the blood falls. It is the fat molecules that move through the body along with the blood through the blood vessels. Thus it reduces the risk of different diseases and you can stay safe from the dangers of blockage of the blood vessels.\\n\\n5. High-density lipoprotein is a very healthy fat content of the body. While you decrease the amount of carb intake, it gradually increases the HDL level in the body. It keeps the heart healthy and protects the other organs from danger.\\n\\n6. As soon as you decrease your intake of carbs, it causes a lower level of sugar in your blood. Lower sugar level thus causes lowering the insulin levels. The Keto diet is thus very helpful for those who have blood sugar.\\n\\n7. It also brings the blood pressure under control as increased carbohydrate is the cause of elevated blood pressure too.   \n",

Before I get started, apologies for the format of this. I'm not super good at organizing my thoughts but I wanted to share my journey and the insights that have come to me along the way. Hopefully this is all decipherable. \\n\\nTo begin with - I started my keto journey in late 2018 at a starting weight of 155 lbs and a goal weight of 110 lbs. I am 32F, 5'1\". See pictures in the imgur link at the bottom. NOTE: from the pictures 110 might be a little thin for me, but my rationale was that I might gain a lot of water weight and bounce back to 115 which I think is a maintainable weight that I would be really happy with. So that's how I came to my goal. \\n\\nOver the course of the next year and change, I lost a total of 39 pounds getting to a low weight of 116 pounds. Around January 2020, I took a 1 month keto break and went back up to 120. Staying on the horse after this break was difficult, and ultimately I fell off entirely when the pandemic hit. I ended up gaining 20 pounds back to 140.\\n\\nWell New Year's came around, and I resolved to get back to my original goal weight of 110 lbs. \\n\\nI was pretty mad at myself that I let myself slip so much and let all that hard work go to waste, so I set a really aggressive goal of 2 lbs per week. Barring 1 or 2 bad weeks, I have kept up with this so far! It is now the end of Week 11 and I have lost 17 lbs. I definitely noticed I have lost weight a lot faster this time around. I don't believe it is because \"it's my second time\", but rather some key differences in the way I decided to approach Keto the second time and I'd like to share these with you.\\n\\nPre-Keto habits:\\n\\n* **I was a fairly gluttonous person** with poor meal portion awareness/control. I just wanted to stuff my face all day everyday with my favorite foods, it was the most amazing and soothing feeling in the world.\\n* I lived for carbs. Pasta, pizza and potato chips specifically\\n* I loathed exercise\\n\\nKeto first round (2018-2019) philosophy (**AKA THINGS NOT TO DO, even though I lost 39 lbs on it**):\\n\\n* Diets had always failed for me, because I just wanted to always shove food in my mouth. I think the reason Keto initially worked for me was because, I figured out that as long as something had next to 0 carbs in it, I could basically eat as much as I wanted and still lose weight. This was basically a miracle diet for me. I made a list of foods that I didn't want to go without, found the ones that had very, very few carbs, and just shoveled those things into my face 24/7. In hindsight, this was really unhealthy but ultimately it got the ball rolling. But the takeaway is, **Keto initially worked for me because I was able to continue feeding my glutton habit.** \\n* Toward the end of 2019, I was really beginning to crave carbs and would get sloppier and sloppier with takeout meals and cheat snacks. My rationale was \"the more fat I eat, the more carbs I can eat since really carb quota is based on percentage of total macros\". This led to **more snowballing with the gluttony**, and I found myself eating massive amounts of fat everyday to justify going up to 30 or 40 grams of carbs. I'm not sure if this logic actually holds true for Keto. I didn't gain weight, but I didn't lose weight either - probably due to the sheer calories in to calories out ratio.\\n* In the second half of 2019 I began to rely heavily on highly processed keto substitutes, what I call fake foods: products with wheat or milk protein isolate that mimicked puffy grains and cereals, baked goods such as cookies, brownies and cakes with fake sugar and almond/coconut flours, and substitute breads, such as almond meal bread, cloud bread, and whatever voodoo magic ThinSlim's breads are made of. At some point, my diet consisted of 80% or more of these packaged keto substitute fake foods, and I was barely even eating any veggies or meat. Once again, **my gluttonous tendencies had taken over** but this time I was trying to just eat as much comforting processed, easy-to-binge foods as possible. \\n* I didn't have an exit strategy. My exit during January 2020 was basically, \"I miss carbs and I'm going to try to binge on them like crazy for a month to get the urge out of the way.\" Yeah, right cadonana. This was dangerous, self-enabling, excuse-riddled talk. I never thought ahead to what my regular diet might look like after I hit my goal weight or came off keto. Heavens knows that the way I was eating was absolutely not healthy or sustainable, despite the fact that I was losing weight.\\n\\nQueue the pandemic. Welllllll, old and constant friend Gluttony, let's see how we did:\\n\\n* Absolutely just started eating my feelings and bingeing every processed comfort food in sight, in mass quantities. I'd run to the drug store in my PPE and clean out the kettle chips shelf once a week. Sometimes I'd sit in front of the TV and eat 2 bags of chips in one sitting. Rice, ramen, mac and cheese, pizza, oh my gosh. I'm surprised I didn't get diabetes during the pandemic. \\n* I was also \"gluttonous\" in other ways. My retail therapy spending got out of control, and I found my front door being piled with packages of useless crap over the past year.\\n\\nHello 2021! Time for fresh starts and healthier perspectives. Well obviously, something had had to change. I had ballooned out to 140 lbs again. I was no longer fitting the new wardrobe I had bought myself in 2019. My bank account was drained. I was sleeping whenever possible, just barely doing the things I needed to. It was a pretty dark time for me. I felt like crap, physically and mentally. \\n\\nJanuary 1st came around, and I resolved the next day I would stop shoveling mac and cheese into my piehole and start taking care of myself more. \\n\\nHere are the things I did differently the second time around:\\n\\n* As mentioned before, I was pretty mad at myself and set an aggressive goal of 2 lbs per week. What really surprised me, 3 months in, is that I was able to more or less stick to this so far.\\n* I made a nifty chart (see link below) to track my progress and came up with some rewards for myself. I think this tracking chart actually helped my motivation immensely. It's so satisfying when I hit a day where I can color in another block! Note that I also laminated the chart, so I can erase progress in case I'm bad and gain weight again, haha. \\n* Ironically, my severe spending habit in 2020 helped me in a way: In addition to starting up Keto again, I had put myself on a rather strict budget and savings goal for 2021. This helped me so much because I simply couldn't afford all those expensive, pre-packaged Keto fake foods that I had binged on so much in the year before. **I think the presence of really comforting, \"yummy\" foods in my cabinet really contributed to a binge addiction in 2019 for me**. \\n* I'm focusing now on SIMPLE meals, 1) because I can't afford anything fancy or takeout right now, and b) I don't enjoy cooking and am too depressed/don't otherwise have energy to sink into preparing a nice meal. I think this, in combination with the lack of packaged fake foods, has really calmed down my so-called \"glutton response\". \\n* Every now and then I do some meal prep and create some very tasty, complex keto dishes. Some examples are shirataki alfredo, or paneer tikka masala. However, I found that eating these foods completely triggered my glutton response. On the days I made these meals for myself, I would portion out enough for a whole work week but then eat it all in two days. **I just could not help myself with these more complex, savory meals. I would crave the flavor and the mouth feel so much that I literally could not stop myself from going back to the fridge for more**. In contrast, if I eat a simple meal of lightly seasoned roasted or steamed veggies with some simply cooked chicken for example, **I would always be satisfied with the portion I originally set for myself**. \\n* The above 3 bullet points led me to realize that after all this time, after the 17 lbs I lost in 2021 and extreme self control I have exercised so far, **I still have an enormous psychological issue with food**. Okay, I know this was pretty obvious in hindsight, but I just couldn't define it well in my head. Maybe it's an addition to certain flavors or textures, maybe it's trying to fill the emotional void I feel with delicious foods. But now that I realized that, I'm going to avoid what I call \"complex meals\" (highly seasoned and well textured) until I can work with to figure out how to break the addiction. I will begin to work with a therapist soon on these issues!\\n* That being said, I do treat myself with a small packaged keto brownie every day or other day if I can afford to get some that week. But I make sure to get a bunch of one type at a time. This way I get sick of having the same treat every single day and it reduces my urge to binge, lol\\n* The last and (what I think is) most important point that I want to make is, that it is so, so, so much easier to restrict calories to a normal amount (as opposed to bingeing thousands of calories of fat) when you are not tempting yourself with your addictions all the time. Cramming your face with fat all the time for sustained period is not the way to go, like I did the first time. Sure, the benefit of losing weight more quickly right now is great because I am eating balanced (well, keto-balanced - still eating that scoop of cream cheese at the end of everyday to get my fat macros in), whole/real-food meals. But I'm realizing this is just so much healthier. I feel great, I have energy, I am happy with my weight loss. But most importantly, **I believe now that I can transition from this to a sustainable, permanent, healthy lifestyle after I come off keto**. I have identified a major psychological issue that I am going to address which will help me sustain a new lifestyle after I hit my goal weight. Because let's be real, life is better with carbs - but I only deserve them if I can stop myself from out of control shoving them in my face. And I believe I can achieve this.  \\n\\nNext steps, and I think this is SO IMPORTANT!!!: **come up with an exit plan and permanent, healthy, maintainable lifestyle change for after I hit my weight goal.** Let's be honest. I love carbs. This second round of Keto has made me realize that I can have a healthy lifestyle of enjoying carbs for the rest of my life AND maintain the weight I want, if I only address my binge eating issues. I haven't come up with this plan yet, but on my list is:\\n\\n* Experimenting in the weeks and months after I exit keto to find out what my ideal \"maintain weight\" calories/macros are, and factoring \"feeling good\" and \"having energy\" heavily into this. \\n* Aggressively working on my bingeing issues in talk therapy. \\n* Figuring out how to eat delicious foods that I'm likely to binge, without getting to that point\\n* Fun and maintainable exercise: A strength building routine, and finding a type of cardio that I don't hate. \\n\\nIf you read all this, thank you! Again, sorry about the length and formatting/organization. I hope this helps people regardless!!\\n\\n[See pictures of my progress and keto tracker here!](https://imgur.com/a/K1mex0m)\\n\\n**tl;dr** \\n\\n* Eat real, whole foods during keto. Don't cheat with fake sugars, isolates. Rewarding occasionally is okay but be strict about how much you eat!\\n* This will help you with portion control and listen to your body to actually know when to stop eating. \\n* Progress tracking charts are fun, helpful, and very motivational.\\n* Do some introspection and try to figure out your issues with food. This helped me discover a huge psychological issue I have with bingeing food and I'm going to get help in therapy for it now. \\n* Now that I have discovered these things, I have so much hope that I can sustain a healthy diet  after I hit my goal weight and enjoy carbs/life in a healthy way!   \n",

majority of my life with my weight, going up to 330lbs at my peak in my late 20s, yo yo-ing up and down, stabilizing at about \\~275 for a few years until I decided about 15 years ago to go through bariatric surgery and get a lap band. That helped me out for a while, bringing my weight down to about 225, but I was building a ton of muscle at that point, going to the gym 5 days a week for a mix of light cardio and strength. And then, of course, \"life got in the way\". I work in tech, which meant long hours, grabbing whatever I could eat, and things crept up.\\n\\nOver the last 20 years, I've also been suffering from mild clinical depression. Nothing crazy, but enough to add to the \"uggggggghh\" aspect of life and exercise, and coming up with excuses not to do X, Y, or Z. Unsurprisingly, things were a lot better during my \"healthy\" period, and my psychiatrist has often recommended focusing on my weight loss to get better. Easier said than done, especially when living in my head!\\n\\nThe challenge for me has been trust, and accountability. I'm married, with 2 kids, and am the cook of the house. My wife has known me forever (40+ years), and has seen me through all of my phases. I love her to death, and I know she means well, but she can be very judgmental, and over the years, I've lost my ability to have a proper discussion around anything regarding my health, or weight. I just get incredibly defensive, and change the subject.\\n\\nI've also tried, and somewhat successfully lost a decent chunk of weight. A few years back, I got into golfing (after years of making fun of my parents), and started WW at the time and dropped a good 25lbs in a few weeks. But I would do all of this avoiding conversations with the family, or even mentioning I was doing it. Given I'm the cook in the house, it didn't lead to good, sustaining results. This accountability problem didn't just lie with how I interacted with my family, heck, my feeling of repeated failure kept pushing me to delay visits to doctors for checkups, and given my family has a long history of diabetes, and some heart disease, it was incredibly irresponsible. I'm a walking heart attack waiting to happen. I'd always push my reminders out a few months until \"I'd lose enough weight to have some good news to give my dr as she gave me the look of disappointment.\".\\n\\nA few months back, I realized that a year of quarantine killed what little exercise I was getting at work, and my days consisted of 10 hours on my desk chair, a few hours with the family, and then a few hours watching TV or back to work. My sleeping patterns were messed up because I'd choose to fall asleep on the couch, setting my alarm for \\~5am to then go up to bed, so my wife could get a really good night sleep without me snoring next to her (no sleep apnea, but boy, I can be a trumpet). My back is shot, I can barely walk straight, and am in constant pain. I'm an 80 year old man in a 40something body. The thought of the pandemic being over and the world going back to \"normal\" is both exciting, but also agonizing. No more excuses to do absolutely nothing.\\n\\nWhile my depression has always been fairly mild, I've lost family members to suicide, and would never ever every think of inflicting something like that on my own family and friends. But hey, if I died from a heart attack, would that be so bad? I felt like I hit rock bottom. \\n\\nI know it sounds dumb, but it took all my courage to sit down with my wife and tell her that it was time, I was seeking help, and that while I knew she meant well, I needed her to give me some room here. I'd tried keto a few times for short periods of time, and it suits me well in general as I'm not really a carbs person anyhow (but doing it in hiding is incredibly difficult...). I decided to bite the bullet, and sign up to Virta Health, buy a peloton, and say screw it - I'll be the guy who comes in 100 thousandth on leaderboards for a while, but I know I'll be better. Two things that work with me: accountability and gamification. Virta holds me accountable. No hiding, the coach is on you daily, everything's measured. It forced me to go to the dr and get results (and I'm just incredibly lucky that despite all the abuse my body has taken, my blood sugars and cholesterol numbers are high, but below any problematic numbers... Peloton, once I get started, gamifies things. I started on Duolingo learning Japanese a couple of years back for the fun of it, and not only kept going regardless of what was going on, but made me decide to take formal lessons and go to Japan. All that because of that damn streak :)\\n\\nI know all of this is irrelevant to all of you, but honestly, /r/keto has been an inspiration for the last few years, and seeing all of your stories was really the inspiration to get started. This is just the beginning, but I wanted to say thank you for nudging me to get on the bandwagon that I'm sure I'll fall off of, but get back on again. I owe it to myself, and my amazing family.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThank you all for making it this far.   \n",

I'm taking that as 10lbs water weight for the first week, and then about 1lb per week thereafter which is right on target. \\n\\nBut weightloss aside, I wanted to share how keto has positively affected me, to try and encourage others to stick it out, even if their weightloss journey has been a bit of a bumpy ride. \\n\\nJoint pain - As a young person, experiencing chronic severe joint pain in my fingers and moderate pain in one of my knees for the past few years was painful and frustrating. Before lockdown I went to trapeze and pole fitness classes twice a week, but falls on any of these areas would result in pain that would take weeks to subside. I was told my symptoms were typical of rheumatoid arthritis, but I'd have to go in for further tests to confirm this. Since swapping to keto, my finger pain has disappeared entirely, and my knee pain is barely there. I really believe in this diet for reducing inflammation.\\n\\nSpots / acne - In that same vein, the skin on my face has never been better. Whilst I only had mild acne on my cheeks, the overall quality of my skin was poor with it being bumpy, uneven, and red in places. The redness and spots have gone, and I cannot believe that the uneven texture I had, especially in places like my forehead where it's impossible to miss, has disappeared. \\n\\nFat and water deposits - The first major change I experienced when I lost the initial water weight was the change in skin quality of my thighs. I use to sit on the toilet and look down at my thighs and hate their appearance; not quite cellulite, but lumpy all the same. The skin there has now evened out and the lumps are gone. I wonder if this is where water was being retained unevenly in places between the skin and fat?  \\n\\nBloating - Before keto I was frequently bloated and had stomach pains due to 1) the food I was eating, and 2) a bad habit I had of swallowing air when I was hungry. Despite still drinking the likes of Coke Zero, I haven't experience any bloating or pain whilst on keto, and my better, more fulfilling meals are helping with my air swallowing habit. \\n\\nEnergy levels - I use to suffer from the post lunch slump and, as I'm currently working from home, would have to take a 2hr nap in the afternoon before returning to work. When I was working in the office, this would of course be impossible so my productivity would just cease to exist and I'd be sat at my desk managing to do next to no work. Happy to say that I've shockingly not had a single nap since starting keto. I'm able to go the entire day with my levels of productivity being pretty consistent throughout. \\n\\nBrain fog - Likewise, my brain fog has gone. I struggled focussing on tasks, and was frequently overwhelmed by large amounts of data (I create simulations for the oil and gas industry, so handle a lot of numbers). I feel like my mind is sharper now and I'm less likely to have my eyes \"glaze\" over. \\n\\nMood - I suffer from stress and anxiety. Whether it's just down to making a positive impact in my life, or whether it's the diet itself, I can't remember the last time I felt this good. I feel happy, optimistic and like a metaphorical weight has been lifted from me, even before the phsyical weight has gone. For the first time in 7 years, I'm starting to feel like I'm getting myself back. \\n\\nSleep - No more struggling to sleep. I'm getting a good, undisturbed night of sleep each night, and have gone from being that person who hits the snooze button on their alarm clock a million times, to waking up before my alarm. \\n\\nRelationship with food - I hated food. I was a high carb snack eater because I hated preparing meals. Now I actually enjoy the process of researching what I'm going to make, getting creative with recipes, and then getting hands on with making it. Keto's restrictions remove some of the overwhelming choice there is with food, and working within those confines actually makes it easier to come up with interesting dishes. \\n\\nHopefully some of my experience can act as motivation for others, so thanks for letting me share ☺️   \n",

month after that you will have to take a short break of nearly one week and then again you can go for the second phase of your keto diet plan   a ketogenic diet is basically a form of diet that does not have the responsibility to give you proper health  it is only used to lose weight early  people who are suffering from cardiac problems  certain brain diseases  and have problems with acne are advised to stay away from this kind of diet  since the heavy fat content can increase the problems as well  though this diet is all about reducing the intake of carbohydrates it eventually increases the intake of fat through different foods like butter  oil  and cheese  this is why you require taking proper advice from your doctor as well as a diet expert on whether you can go for this diet plan or not  without knowing the proper ways of adapting to this diet plan can cause you heavy harm  eventually  there are some side effects of this diet  and people who are capable of tolerating these things can go for or other specific kinds of diet plans     preparation before you start a keto diet    changing to a different type of diet system requires some preparation of the body  you can t switch over to a different kind of food plan suddenly as the body requires getting adapted with it  first of all  you need to start with the basics of the keto diet  it may cause you some uncomfortable moments first up but slowly and gradually it will get adjusted  since the keto diet is targeted to reduce the carb intake in your daily meal  there will be less than 30 grams of carbs daily in your diet  the lack of carbs will be fulfilled by the intake of fats  as carbs are the sources of energy for the physiological and physical functions of the body  you require some substitute to cover the lack  fat is a very good source of energy in the body and in absence of carbs  it will oxidize to generate energy in your body  so your meals should be filled with meat  cheese  nuts  oilseeds  eggs  and other sources of fats  the same amount of fat gives double energy than that of carbs and thus you need to put some low calorie vegetables in your daily meal   during the keto diet  you should keep some important aspects of it in mind  you will not get that much low carb food here and there and thus you need to carry your snacks wherever you are going  it will cause you a sense of unfulfillment many a time after you eat meals as carbs help to secrete the hormone that gives you the signal that you are done with your food  taking too much protein diet will definitely cause you some change in the chemical as well as fluid balance in your body  it will also affect the balance of minerals in your body too  there you may have to take enough salt as well as electrolytes from outside too to keep your body hydrated  if you want your keto diet to work faster  then you can use some keto salt supplements too  there may be several obstacles in your road to  weight loss  https   www fitex club healthy weight loss diet within budget   through the keto diet  but you need to stay focused and not lose hope     things that you can take during your keto diet    since you are not taking carbs in ample amounts  you need to take such foods that will keep you filled  without a proper amount of food you may feel starving as well as due to lack of satisfaction after eating  you may have mood swings as well  so here are some of the best foods that you can eat during your keto diet     1  meat    meat is a very good source of protein  it will help you to build your muscles and shred extra fats in your body  there are varieties of meat that are available in the market  most people who are on the journey of weight loss try to avoid red meat like mutton  beef  pork  and so on  but here in the keto diet  you can easily go for all kinds of meats  in other weight loss diets  the experts recommend only boiled meat so that no extra oil can get in  but in this case  you can go for your favorite dishes made of chicken or mutton or beef and no one is going to stop you since along with protein  you also need ample amounts of fat too     2  fish    sea fishes can be very good sources of high protein and essential fatty acids  they are actually very tasty and are very good for heart health  on the other hand  it will provide the necessary amount of protein as well as fat content required for the keto diet plan  salmon  tuna  mackerel  trout can be very good options for those who are going through their keto diet plan     3  dairy products    milk and dairy products are very essential in this case of diet  milk contains almost all kinds of micro nutrients which are really necessary  it also will give you some amount of carbs along with fat too  other than that  cheese  butter  and creams can be beneficial for the person going through the keto diet     4  nuts and oilseeds    these are very important parts of the keto diet since they contain essential fat contents for your health  almonds  walnuts  cashew  peanut along with flaxseed  pumpkin seeds are very healthy ingredients in keto diets  you can take them through your meal as they will provide you the necessary amount of good fats to keep your internal organs healthy     5  vegetables    filled with vitamins and minerals  vegetables are very much needed for those who are going through the keto diet  vegetables will keep your stomach full and the dietary fibers present in them will definitely keep your stomach healthy  vegetables of different colors will provide you different types of vitamins as well as minerals too  on the other hand  they will give you some amount of carbohydrates as well  if you are looking for some change of test of your mouth  then these veggies will definitely provide you with a different kind of test     foods that you should avoid during the keto diet    when you are going through a keto diet you need to take proper food enriched in protein and fat but the only thing you should avoid is carbohydrates  most of the snacks available in the market are full of carbohydrates  though there are different types of carbohydrates  still the snacks are mostly made of simple carbs that get into the body and assimilate easily to release energy  this is why they get digested quickly and you feel hungry soon after you finish the snacks  some of the foods that you should strictly avoid if you are going through your keto diet plan are mentioned here   the first thing that comes on the list is bread and bakery foods  bread is one of the steady foods of our  daily life  https   www fitex club this is how you can incorporate healthy activities into your daily life    it is a good source of carbohydrates that helps you to generate energy for all your works  this is why consuming bread and bakery products  diet crackers  cookies are strictly forbidden in the keto diet plans  the second thing that should be avoided is sweet and sugary foods  sweets are full of sugar and sugar is the finest form of carbs  this is why you need to avoid sugar and sweet foods very strictly  sweetened beverages contain a high amount of sugar so you need to stay away from soda  different kinds of packaged fruit juices  sweetened tea  and soft drinks   on the other hand spaghetti  noodles  wheat  rice  cereals  potatoes  corn  peas  pumpkin  black beans  chickpeas  citrus fruits like oranges  grapes  pineapples  and most importantly alcoholic drinks should be avoided if you want to get your body fat free really  there are different kinds of fats too that you should not consume during your keto diet like margarine  vegetable oils  and so on when you are taking protein as the major contributor to your meal you should definitely try to have fresh meat  processed and packaged meat is very much unhealthy and will disturb your goal of losing weight   so far we were discussing the foods that we should avoid during the keto diet plan  but there are some foods that we can easily take  these foods contain healthy fat in good proportion and thus you can consume them to keep your body healthy  there are some supplements that you can take like exogenous ketone supplements  this is nothing but some extra amount of ketones that you provide to your body from outside  medium chain triglycerides give the ketones a boost to keep your body healthy   they are also beneficial in terms of losing weight  gaining energy for your daily works as well as they help in digestion also  there are some snack options too for the people who are going through the keto diet  almonds and cheese are very good sources of healthy fat for the body  avocado with chicken salad  unsweetened coconut  nuts and seeds  half boiled eggs  olives  and salami berries can be good snack options for you so that you don t feel starved while you are traveling or you are out of your home for a longer period of time     benefits of keto diet    1  the lower the number of carbs in the diet  the lower the appetite will be  the experts say that sugary and carbohydrate foods increase the appetite  hunger is the enemy of your diet plan and thus if you will go for a keto diet  then you will feel less hungry   2  while you will lower the number of carbs in your meal  it will cause drastic weight loss at the start of the diet plan  as we all know that carbs are the fuel of our body and thus while there is less supply of carbs in the body  it will use the fat to generate the energy for the physical or physiological works of the body  this will cause faster shredding of fats from the body   3  like in nature  in our body also  there are different types of fats available  there are different sites where the fats are stored  the risk of health is thus determined by the deposition of the fats inside the body  mostly the fats deposited in the lower abdomen are very harmful  this fat is very rigid and thus is the reason for obesity  while you lower the number of carbs in your diet  you will notice that the fat stored in the lower abdomen is getting shredded very fast  the fat which is used to generate energy in absence of carbs is generally supplied from this portion of the body   4  while you lower the amount of carb intake in your body  the triglyceride content of the blood falls  it is the fat molecules that move through the body along with the blood through the blood vessels  thus it reduces the risk of different diseases and you can stay safe from the dangers of blockage of the blood vessels   5  high density lipoprotein is a very healthy fat content of the body  while you decrease the amount of carb intake  it gradually increases the hdl level in the body  it keeps the heart healthy and protects the other organs from danger   6  as soon as you decrease your intake of carbs  it causes a lower level of sugar in your blood  lower sugar level thus causes lowering the insulin levels  the keto diet is thus very helpful for those who have blood sugar   7  it also brings the blood pressure under control as increased carbohydrate is the cause of elevated blood pressure too    \n",

                                                                                                                                                                  hey all  before i get started  apologies for the format of this  i'm not super good at organizing my thoughts but i wanted to share my journey and the insights that have come to me along the way  hopefully this is all decipherable    to begin with   i started my keto journey in late 2018 at a starting weight of 155 lbs and a goal weight of 110 lbs  i am 32f  5'1   see pictures in the imgur link at the bottom  note  from the pictures 110 might be a little thin for me  but my rationale was that i might gain a lot of water weight and bounce back to 115 which i think is a maintainable weight that i would be really happy with  so that's how i came to my goal    over the course of the next year and change  i lost a total of 39 pounds getting to a low weight of 116 pounds  around january 2020  i took a 1 month keto break and went back up to 120  staying on the horse after this break was difficult  and ultimately i fell off entirely when the pandemic hit  i ended up gaining 20 pounds back to 140   well new year's came around  and i resolved to get back to my original goal weight of 110 lbs    i was pretty mad at myself that i let myself slip so much and let all that hard work go to waste  so i set a really aggressive goal of 2 lbs per week  barring 1 or 2 bad weeks  i have kept up with this so far  it is now the end of week 11 and i have lost 17 lbs  i definitely noticed i have lost weight a lot faster this time around  i don't believe it is because  it's my second time   but rather some key differences in the way i decided to approach keto the second time and i'd like to share these with you   pre keto habits       i was a fairly gluttonous person   with poor meal portion awareness control  i just wanted to stuff my face all day everyday with my favorite foods  it was the most amazing and soothing feeling in the world    i lived for carbs  pasta  pizza and potato chips specifically   i loathed exercise  keto first round  2018 2019  philosophy    aka things not to do  even though i lost 39 lbs on it        diets had always failed for me  because i just wanted to always shove food in my mouth  i think the reason keto initially worked for me was because  i figured out that as long as something had next to 0 carbs in it  i could basically eat as much as i wanted and still lose weight  this was basically a miracle diet for me  i made a list of foods that i didn't want to go without  found the ones that had very  very few carbs  and just shoveled those things into my face 24 7  in hindsight  this was really unhealthy but ultimately it got the ball rolling  but the takeaway is    keto initially worked for me because i was able to continue feeding my glutton habit       toward the end of 2019  i was really beginning to crave carbs and would get sloppier and sloppier with takeout meals and cheat snacks  my rationale was  the more fat i eat  the more carbs i can eat since really carb quota is based on percentage of total macros   this led to   more snowballing with the gluttony    and i found myself eating massive amounts of fat everyday to justify going up to 30 or 40 grams of carbs  i'm not sure if this logic actually holds true for keto  i didn't gain weight  but i didn't lose weight either   probably due to the sheer calories in to calories out ratio    in the second half of 2019 i began to rely heavily on highly processed keto substitutes  what i call fake foods  products with wheat or milk protein isolate that mimicked puffy grains and cereals  baked goods such as cookies  brownies and cakes with fake sugar and almond coconut flours  and substitute breads  such as almond meal bread  cloud bread  and whatever voodoo magic thinslim's breads are made of  at some point  my diet consisted of 80  or more of these packaged keto substitute fake foods  and i was barely even eating any veggies or meat  once again    my gluttonous tendencies had taken over   but this time i was trying to just eat as much comforting processed  easy to binge foods as possible     i didn't have an exit strategy  my exit during january 2020 was basically   i miss carbs and i'm going to try to binge on them like crazy for a month to get the urge out of the way   yeah  right cadonana  this was dangerous  self enabling  excuse riddled talk  i never thought ahead to what my regular diet might look like after i hit my goal weight or came off keto  heavens knows that the way i was eating was absolutely not healthy or sustainable  despite the fact that i was losing weight   queue the pandemic  welllllll  old and constant friend gluttony  let's see how we did     absolutely just started eating my feelings and bingeing every processed comfort food in sight  in mass quantities  i'd run to the drug store in my ppe and clean out the kettle chips shelf once a week  sometimes i'd sit in front of the tv and eat 2 bags of chips in one sitting  rice  ramen  mac and cheese  pizza  oh my gosh  i'm surprised i didn't get diabetes during the pandemic     i was also  gluttonous  in other ways  my retail therapy spending got out of control  and i found my front door being piled with packages of useless crap over the past year   hello 2021  time for fresh starts and healthier perspectives  well obviously  something had had to change  i had ballooned out to 140 lbs again  i was no longer fitting the new wardrobe i had bought myself in 2019  my bank account was drained  i was sleeping whenever possible  just barely doing the things i needed to  it was a pretty dark time for me  i felt like crap  physically and mentally    january 1st came around  and i resolved the next day i would stop shoveling mac and cheese into my piehole and start taking care of myself more    here are the things i did differently the second time around     as mentioned before  i was pretty mad at myself and set an aggressive goal of 2 lbs per week  what really surprised me  3 months in  is that i was able to more or less stick to this so far    i made a nifty chart  see link below  to track my progress and came up with some rewards for myself  i think this tracking chart actually helped my motivation immensely  it's so satisfying when i hit a day where i can color in another block  note that i also laminated the chart  so i can erase progress in case i'm bad and gain weight again  haha     ironically  my severe spending habit in 2020 helped me in a way  in addition to starting up keto again  i had put myself on a rather strict budget and savings goal for 2021  this helped me so much because i simply couldn't afford all those expensive  pre packaged keto fake foods that i had binged on so much in the year before    i think the presence of really comforting   yummy  foods in my cabinet really contributed to a binge addiction in 2019 for me       i'm focusing now on simple meals  1  because i can't afford anything fancy or takeout right now  and b  i don't enjoy cooking and am too depressed don't otherwise have energy to sink into preparing a nice meal  i think this  in combination with the lack of packaged fake foods  has really calmed down my so called  glutton response      every now and then i do some meal prep and create some very tasty  complex keto dishes  some examples are shirataki alfredo  or paneer tikka masala  however  i found that eating these foods completely triggered my glutton response  on the days i made these meals for myself  i would portion out enough for a whole work week but then eat it all in two days    i just could not help myself with these more complex  savory meals  i would crave the flavor and the mouth feel so much that i literally could not stop myself from going back to the fridge for more    in contrast  if i eat a simple meal of lightly seasoned roasted or steamed veggies with some simply cooked chicken for example    i would always be satisfied with the portion i originally set for myself       the above 3 bullet points led me to realize that after all this time  after the 17 lbs i lost in 2021 and extreme self control i have exercised so far    i still have an enormous psychological issue with food    okay  i know this was pretty obvious in hindsight  but i just couldn't define it well in my head  maybe it's an addition to certain flavors or textures  maybe it's trying to fill the emotional void i feel with delicious foods  but now that i realized that  i'm going to avoid what i call  complex meals   highly seasoned and well textured  until i can work with to figure out how to break the addiction  i will begin to work with a therapist soon on these issues    that being said  i do treat myself with a small packaged keto brownie every day or other day if i can afford to get some that week  but i make sure to get a bunch of one type at a time  this way i get sick of having the same treat every single day and it reduces my urge to binge  lol   the last and  what i think is  most important point that i want to make is  that it is so  so  so much easier to restrict calories to a normal amount  as opposed to bingeing thousands of calories of fat  when you are not tempting yourself with your addictions all the time  cramming your face with fat all the time for sustained period is not the way to go  like i did the first time  sure  the benefit of losing weight more quickly right now is great because i am eating balanced  well  keto balanced   still eating that scoop of cream cheese at the end of everyday to get my fat macros in   whole real food meals  but i'm realizing this is just so much healthier  i feel great  i have energy  i am happy with my weight loss  but most importantly    i believe now that i can transition from this to a sustainable  permanent  healthy lifestyle after i come off keto    i have identified a major psychological issue that i am going to address which will help me sustain a new lifestyle after i hit my goal weight  because let's be real  life is better with carbs   but i only deserve them if i can stop myself from out of control shoving them in my face  and i believe i can achieve this     next steps  and i think this is so important       come up with an exit plan and permanent  healthy  maintainable lifestyle change for after i hit my weight goal    let's be honest  i love carbs  this second round of keto has made me realize that i can have a healthy lifestyle of enjoying carbs for the rest of my life and maintain the weight i want  if i only address my binge eating issues  i haven't come up with this plan yet  but on my list is     experimenting in the weeks and months after i exit keto to find out what my ideal  maintain weight  calories macros are  and factoring  feeling good  and  having energy  heavily into this     aggressively working on my bingeing issues in talk therapy     figuring out how to eat delicious foods that i'm likely to binge  without getting to that point   fun and maintainable exercise  a strength building routine  and finding a type of cardio that i don't hate    if you read all this  thank you  again  sorry about the length and formatting organization  i hope this helps people regardless     see pictures of my progress and keto tracker here   https   imgur com a k1mex0m     tl dr       eat real  whole foods during keto  don't cheat with fake sugars  isolates  rewarding occasionally is okay but be strict about how much you eat    this will help you with portion control and listen to your body to actually know when to stop eating     progress tracking charts are fun  helpful  and very motivational    do some introspection and try to figure out your issues with food  this helped me discover a huge psychological issue i have with bingeing food and i'm going to get help in therapy for it now     now that i have discovered these things  i have so much hope that i can sustain a healthy diet  after i hit my goal weight and enjoy carbs life in a healthy way    \n",

330lbs at my peak in my late 20s  yo yo ing up and down  stabilizing at about   275 for a few years until i decided about 15 years ago to go through bariatric surgery and get a lap band  that helped me out for a while  bringing my weight down to about 225  but i was building a ton of muscle at that point  going to the gym 5 days a week for a mix of light cardio and strength  and then  of course   life got in the way   i work in tech  which meant long hours  grabbing whatever i could eat  and things crept up   over the last 20 years  i've also been suffering from mild clinical depression  nothing crazy  but enough to add to the  uggggggghh  aspect of life and exercise  and coming up with excuses not to do x  y  or z  unsurprisingly  things were a lot better during my  healthy  period  and my psychiatrist has often recommended focusing on my weight loss to get better  easier said than done  especially when living in my head   the challenge for me has been trust  and accountability  i'm married  with 2 kids  and am the cook of the house  my wife has known me forever  40+ years   and has seen me through all of my phases  i love her to death  and i know she means well  but she can be very judgmental  and over the years  i've lost my ability to have a proper discussion around anything regarding my health  or weight  i just get incredibly defensive  and change the subject   i've also tried  and somewhat successfully lost a decent chunk of weight  a few years back  i got into golfing  after years of making fun of my parents   and started ww at the time and dropped a good 25lbs in a few weeks  but i would do all of this avoiding conversations with the family  or even mentioning i was doing it  given i'm the cook in the house  it didn't lead to good  sustaining results  this accountability problem didn't just lie with how i interacted with my family  heck  my feeling of repeated failure kept pushing me to delay visits to doctors for checkups  and given my family has a long history of diabetes  and some heart disease  it was incredibly irresponsible  i'm a walking heart attack waiting to happen  i'd always push my reminders out a few months until  i'd lose enough weight to have some good news to give my dr as she gave me the look of disappointment     a few months back  i realized that a year of quarantine killed what little exercise i was getting at work  and my days consisted of 10 hours on my desk chair  a few hours with the family  and then a few hours watching tv or back to work  my sleeping patterns were messed up because i'd choose to fall asleep on the couch  setting my alarm for   5am to then go up to bed  so my wife could get a really good night sleep without me snoring next to her  no sleep apnea  but boy  i can be a trumpet   my back is shot  i can barely walk straight  and am in constant pain  i'm an 80 year old man in a 40something body  the thought of the pandemic being over and the world going back to  normal  is both exciting  but also agonizing  no more excuses to do absolutely nothing   while my depression has always been fairly mild  i've lost family members to suicide  and would never ever every think of inflicting something like that on my own family and friends  but hey  if i died from a heart attack  would that be so bad  i felt like i hit rock bottom    i know it sounds dumb  but it took all my courage to sit down with my wife and tell her that it was time  i was seeking help  and that while i knew she meant well  i needed her to give me some room here  i'd tried keto a few times for short periods of time  and it suits me well in general as i'm not really a carbs person anyhow  but doing it in hiding is incredibly difficult      i decided to bite the bullet  and sign up to virta health  buy a peloton  and say screw it   i'll be the guy who comes in 100 thousandth on leaderboards for a while  but i know i'll be better  two things that work with me  accountability and gamification  virta holds me accountable  no hiding  the coach is on you daily  everything's measured  it forced me to go to the dr and get results  and i'm just incredibly lucky that despite all the abuse my body has taken  my blood sugars and cholesterol numbers are high  but below any problematic numbers    peloton  once i get started  gamifies things  i started on duolingo learning japanese a couple of years back for the fun of it  and not only kept going regardless of what was going on  but made me decide to take formal lessons and go to japan  all that because of that damn streak     i know all of this is irrelevant to all of you  but honestly   r keto has been an inspiration for the last few years  and seeing all of your stories was really the inspiration to get started  this is just the beginning  but i wanted to say thank you for nudging me to get on the bandwagon that i'm sure i'll fall off of  but get back on again  i owe it to myself  and my amazing family    amp  x200b   thank you all for making it this far    \n",

my keto journey  and swapped to my new macros just a few days ago so hopefully the weightloss improves   i'm still very happy with 14lbs though  i'm taking that as 10lbs water weight for the first week  and then about 1lb per week thereafter which is right on target    but weightloss aside  i wanted to share how keto has positively affected me  to try and encourage others to stick it out  even if their weightloss journey has been a bit of a bumpy ride    joint pain   as a young person  experiencing chronic severe joint pain in my fingers and moderate pain in one of my knees for the past few years was painful and frustrating  before lockdown i went to trapeze and pole fitness classes twice a week  but falls on any of these areas would result in pain that would take weeks to subside  i was told my symptoms were typical of rheumatoid arthritis  but i'd have to go in for further tests to confirm this  since swapping to keto  my finger pain has disappeared entirely  and my knee pain is barely there  i really believe in this diet for reducing inflammation   spots   acne   in that same vein  the skin on my face has never been better  whilst i only had mild acne on my cheeks  the overall quality of my skin was poor with it being bumpy  uneven  and red in places  the redness and spots have gone  and i cannot believe that the uneven texture i had  especially in places like my forehead where it's impossible to miss  has disappeared    fat and water deposits   the first major change i experienced when i lost the initial water weight was the change in skin quality of my thighs  i use to sit on the toilet and look down at my thighs and hate their appearance  not quite cellulite  but lumpy all the same  the skin there has now evened out and the lumps are gone  i wonder if this is where water was being retained unevenly in places between the skin and fat     bloating   before keto i was frequently bloated and had stomach pains due to 1  the food i was eating  and 2  a bad habit i had of swallowing air when i was hungry  despite still drinking the likes of coke zero  i haven't experience any bloating or pain whilst on keto  and my better  more fulfilling meals are helping with my air swallowing habit    energy levels   i use to suffer from the post lunch slump and  as i'm currently working from home  would have to take a 2hr nap in the afternoon before returning to work  when i was working in the office  this would of course be impossible so my productivity would just cease to exist and i'd be sat at my desk managing to do next to no work  happy to say that i've shockingly not had a single nap since starting keto  i'm able to go the entire day with my levels of productivity being pretty consistent throughout    brain fog   likewise  my brain fog has gone  i struggled focussing on tasks  and was frequently overwhelmed by large amounts of data  i create simulations for the oil and gas industry  so handle a lot of numbers   i feel like my mind is sharper now and i'm less likely to have my eyes  glaze  over    mood   i suffer from stress and anxiety  whether it's just down to making a positive impact in my life  or whether it's the diet itself  i can't remember the last time i felt this good  i feel happy  optimistic and like a metaphorical weight has been lifted from me  even before the phsyical weight has gone  for the first time in 7 years  i'm starting to feel like i'm getting myself back    sleep   no more struggling to sleep  i'm getting a good  undisturbed night of sleep each night  and have gone from being that person who hits the snooze button on their alarm clock a million times  to waking up before my alarm    relationship with food   i hated food  i was a high carb snack eater because i hated preparing meals  now i actually enjoy the process of researching what i'm going to make  getting creative with recipes  and then getting hands on with making it  keto's restrictions remove some of the overwhelming choice there is with food  and working within those confines actually makes it easier to come up with interesting dishes    hopefully some of my experience can act as motivation for others  so thanks for letting me share      \n",

Take the post down.\\n\\n\\---\\n\\nHello to all you wonderful green people of [r/vegan](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan)\\n\\nFirst of all I want to say three crucial things:\\n\\n\\#1 From the bottom of my heart, thank you for choosing compassion over fear and suffering. This is the most important thing we as vegans need to remember and remind ourselves each and every day if we are to live at peace with the fact that we are vegan in a non-vegan. \\n\\n\\#2 I hope to make it as straightforward as possible that my intention of writing this post is not about an egotistical gathering of attention to and around me and my work. Let me be the first to say that the most critical voice that I will ever hear about what I do is my own voice. This post is because I'd like to stretch a hand of compassion and offer an opportunity to those who resonate with me. This project of mine has been a considerable source of personal growth, and I'd like to try at least to inspire someone to join me. I'm doing this because this is what I would have liked to see more of in my own ideal world.\\n\\n\\#3 I hope to clarify that I don't sell anything, nor that I am going to. This post is not about trying to get people to WATCH my content. It's about asking WHAT the vegan community would like to see and hear more of. \\n\\nFor the animals, together we stand strong!\\n\\n\\---Abstract/TLDR---\\n\\nWhat kind of content would you, yourself, have wanted to see produced on YouTube? \\n\\nIs there anything I can help you with to make you start producing your own videos on YouTube? \\n\\nAre there any specific topics, questions, or things I can make to help people be inspired to become vegan or make vegans be inspired to become active for the animals? \\n\\nIs there any suffering (vystopia) which people struggle with, and I can help alleviate through inspiring videos and content on YouTube or otherwise? \\n\\nAny other questions, information, contact info about me, or anything else, please leave a comment. It would mean the whole world to me to get feedback from you.\\n\\n\\---lengthy post with lots of details about who I am, where I'm from, what drives me and why I do what I do follows--- \\n\\nSo basically what drives, and makes me want to innovate is largely fuelled by the profound amount of energy, and gratitude I get from just the simple fact of being vegan, from just having the flame and feeling within me of the knowledge that every day that I live life, I'm sparing animals from being killed. That is what I fundamentally want to pass on to the other people of the vegan community. I really want to help alleviate the suffering people feel about how humanity is treating animals. I want to help people see and realize that we do the things we do to animals because we are unconscious. \\n\\nThis is what the brand I have created since November 2020 has turned into today. \\n\\nMetta Sutta Vegan Activism:\\n\\nThe name \"Metta Sutta\" is inspired by a Buddhist text about the cultivation of goodwill, and it's something I really found inspiring because it's what we as vegans do towards animals.\\n\\nThis is what I've been doing in the vegan community the last few weeks (I've only recently started being active)\\n\\n\\*I've been active in Facebook comments on agricultural/vegan groups for the last month \\n\\n\\*Me and my girlfriend started a podcast (Norwegian podcast) this easter - it's gotten great responses from our closest vegan friends and the community!\\n\\n\\*I have invested around 2000 dollars in hardware for creating high-quality videos: mirrorless camera, professional recording software, microphones, website, ads, etc...\\n\\n\\*Recently, I started producing videos on YouTube. This will be my primary focus from now on. I'm working intensely on upgrading the quality of those videos by working on myself, which is a major reason as to why I'm asking the community for feedback and constructive criticism.\\n\\n\\*Recently started a Metta Sutta Instagram where me and my girlfriend will be collecting and posting inspirational videos, quotes and all things that makes the hearts of vegans melt in joy from the love of animals.\\n\\n\\*Recently became active in reddit (this account is 3 days old :) )\\n\\nI know me posting this may be something that I regret doing \"too soon.\" Still, I would rather get some genuine feedback about my work thus far, and hopefully some guidance on where to go from now on and, hopefully, find someone that would like to connect more with me. \\n\\nFrom the understanding that the reason we as a human race do these things to animals stems from an unconscious state of mind, we as vegans can ourselves become liberated from the constant judging, and maybe more fully start to communicate to the meat-eaters in more effective ways? That's my highest hope, and I wish someone has some thoughts about how we can do this. I've read the book \"A Plea for the Animals\" by a Buddhist monk called Matthieu Ricard and recently listened to \"The Joyful Vegan\" by Colleen Patrick-Goudreau. I find these books highly inspiring, and I want to pass along that inspiration in video and podcast format. And what I'm hoping is that if anyone resonates with anything written here, I would like you to get to know me a little better and work together to find out how to speak our truth to the world more effectively.\\n\\nI'm trying to offer to create a place, a circle of innovation and inspiration that will hopefully blossom into a beautiful space of support and clarity, and my highest wish is that you would be a part of it!\\n\\n\\---\\n\\nA little bit more about me: I'm 22 years old, I've been vegan for 1,5 years now, and l live in Norway. When I first went vegan, I was met with so much resistance from family, friends, and the society around me, and the path from the transition to veganism to the present day, has been a really hard, but rich learning experience. What I really want to do with my work is to inspire vegans to live happily with the knowing that they are doing the right thing, as well as (hopefully) helping meat-eaters realize that choosing compassion is the right choice.\\n\\nHow our truth needs to be spoken is in a way that connects with those people's minds, at their stage of development, through the heart, in a way that's relatable, in my opinion. \\n\\nIf anyone is interested in checking me out, I do have a website: [www.mettasutta.net](https://www.mettasutta.net/) \\- although I'd like to mention that the website is not fully finished yet, it's under construction. Alternatively check out my youtube channel. I recently deleted all my videos from other channels, and reuploaded the best I've made thus far on my main channel \"Metta Sutta\". Some are English, some are Norwegian.  \\n[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAkJcRMcWoY2fsJBF5uXCTQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAkJcRMcWoY2fsJBF5uXCTQ)  \\nIf there is anything particularly good or bad about my videos thus far, feedback is highly appreciated.   \\n\\n\\nI will be actively responding to whatever does (or doesn't) come out of this post. I'm a little bit giddy, and nervous, but at the same time inspired and grateful for doing this.\\n\\nI'm hoping that I can use the responses I get from everyone in the r/vegan subreddit to better see myself clearly and how I need to align myself going forward, to better help the animals that are suffering every day! \\n\\nIf there are any spelling errors, or there is some clarification that's needed, please let me know!</td>\n",

those videos by working on myself  which is a major reason as to why i'm asking the community for feedback and constructive criticism     recently started a metta sutta instagram where me and my girlfriend will be collecting and posting inspirational videos  quotes and all things that makes the hearts of vegans melt in joy from the love of animals     recently became active in reddit  this account is 3 days old       i know me posting this may be something that i regret doing  too soon   still  i would rather get some genuine feedback about my work thus far  and hopefully some guidance on where to go from now on and  hopefully  find someone that would like to connect more with me    from the understanding that the reason we as a human race do these things to animals stems from an unconscious state of mind  we as vegans can ourselves become liberated from the constant judging  and maybe more fully start to communicate to the meat eaters in more effective ways  that's my highest hope  and i wish someone has some thoughts about how we can do this  i've read the book  a plea for the animals  by a buddhist monk called matthieu ricard and recently listened to  the joyful vegan  by colleen patrick goudreau  i find these books highly inspiring  and i want to pass along that inspiration in video and podcast format  and what i'm hoping is that if anyone resonates with anything written here  i would like you to get to know me a little better and work together to find out how to speak our truth to the world more effectively   i'm trying to offer to create a place  a circle of innovation and inspiration that will hopefully blossom into a beautiful space of support and clarity  and my highest wish is that you would be a part of it         a little bit more about me  i'm 22 years old  i've been vegan for 1 5 years now  and l live in norway  when i first went vegan  i was met with so much resistance from family  friends  and the society around me  and the path from the transition to veganism to the present day  has been a really hard  but rich learning experience  what i really want to do with my work is to inspire vegans to live happily with the knowing that they are doing the right thing  as well as  hopefully  helping meat eaters realize that choosing compassion is the right choice   how our truth needs to be spoken is in a way that connects with those people's minds  at their stage of development  through the heart  in a way that's relatable  in my opinion    if anyone is interested in checking me out  i do have a website   www mettasutta net  https   www mettasutta net      although i'd like to mention that the website is not fully finished yet  it's under construction  alternatively check out my youtube channel  i recently deleted all my videos from other channels  and reuploaded the best i've made thus far on my main channel  metta sutta   some are english  some are norwegian     https   www youtube com channel ucakjcrmcwoy2fsjbf5uxctq  https   www youtube com channel ucakjcrmcwoy2fsjbf5uxctq    if there is anything particularly good or bad about my videos thus far  feedback is highly appreciated       i will be actively responding to whatever does  or doesn't  come out of this post  i'm a little bit giddy  and nervous  but at the same time inspired and grateful for doing this   i'm hoping that i can use the responses i get from everyone in the r vegan subreddit to better see myself clearly and how i need to align myself going forward  to better help the animals that are suffering every day    if there are any spelling errors  or there is some clarification that's needed  please let me know</td>\n",

Is it okay ethically to not reveal you are vegan to those around you when they keep questioning it, noticing that all your “excuses” seemingly align with vegan outcomes?\\n\\nIn terms of health...I watched my father die of cancer. It broke me.

While I disagree with them, I’m not a doctor so I don’t know how educated I am on the topic, so I stay quiet.\\n\\nMy father got cancer. His father got cancer. Both died in their 50s long before they should have... both the kindness members of the family... sad face.\\n\\nEveryone (in former associations I had with them, when we would regularly eat together... we don’t do it anymore because of ... reasons... see profile for irrelevant explanation of that...) heavily argued non stop that my grandfathers death was genetic.\\n\\nThing is.... they eat so much god dam meat. Every meal: \\nMeat: red meat; fish; chicken; or some other former sentient animals flesh.\\n\\nSo much bacon. Ungodly amounts of bacon. So much so, that when my loving grandmother made me a bean soup (she’s the only one who I told I was plant based. But she’s not the brightest person and never understood it, so this wasn’t intentional on her part, trust me): she put bacon in the sauce to flavor it. Thinking it was fine since it was only a bit.\\n\\nDairy: cheese, so much god dam cheese; milk; \\n\\nWhen I was a young child I naturally consumed The same foods, up until about 15.\\n\\nLooking back, my symptoms were INSANE and really bad, such that I’m surprised I never considered the food I was eating could be causing me to have these issues.\\n\\nRashes: EVERYWHERE. For arms. Shins. Oh my god dam fingers. Bottom of my feet. It was so bad. Even when I didn’t scratch it would get worse, and when I did scratch I’d get blamed by my family for it getting to that point. “It’s only that bad because you scratch. If you stopped it would go away. (Nah it’s not the food at all). I’d wake up 3 days a week seeing blood everywhere on my bed from the scraps opening up.)\\n\\nCravings: I’d go through non stop physical shakes if I didn’t  have dairy products 3 times a week. My loving father had to limit My ice cream consumption to 3 days a week because I was ballooning up. But i was always trying... my best.. I swear... but the cravings kept getting more and more intense until I gave in.\\n\\nDepression and fatigue. NON STOP FATIGUE. I’d be told by family that I just wasn’t eating enough, them proudly patting their ballooned stomach. I forced myself to eat more of the garbage food. I definitely ate more, but my fatigue got worse and I gained weight \\n\\n\\nAll of this is to just show.. how sick and tired I was of my health feeling like garbage. So I stoped. I told family My decision to just limit (l said lying, knowing i wasn’t eating any behind closed doors) animal products. So please , if they cook, just give me the non animal based parts of the meal.  I’d be more than happy to bring my own food if the entire meal is animal based tho, they had to do NOTHING extra.\\n\\nFirst: they asked why. I explained that I was trying to see if changing my diet could help my symptoms. They told me I was being silly, it wasn’t the food. And that I needed to keep eating these health calorie dense foods, it’s in our DNA!\\n\\nSecond: when the above strategy did not work, and it became clear that for about 2 months I had not gave up (skin improving before their eyes. But they ignored that, claiming I was just not scratching... I was still scratching a lot. They didn’t believe me). They tried a new strategy: guilt tripping me.\\n\\nThey told me I could 100% “cheat” 1 day a week and my health would be fine. When I told them “cheating requires me to want to eat those foods because it brings pleasure, and I don’t get pleasure from the side effects I do still get after eating it, so I don’t “cheat” with foods that cause pain... they god mad.\\n\\n“Oh. So your grandmother slaves over a stove and you are going to be disrespectful and not eat it? Wow.”\\n\\n“No. I do eat the food she makes. See, I’m right now eating plain pasta. L\\n\\n“It’s rude to not eat everything. You are insinuating she’s doing a bad job and making you sick. That’s rude”\\n\\n“What? No, I’m just trying to figure out symptoms by isolating my diet to foods that work. And if I add something in it will show me if my reaction is negative. “\\n\\n“I disagree. It’s rude. “\\n\\n“(Seeing no other way out, I lied) my doctor told me to do this. Are you telling me I should ignore my doctor? “\\n\\nThis shut down all complaints. Once I tied it into “my doctor told me to do this”, they had a difficult time arguing back that I’m being rude. Although they did try, and the sane people at the table would go \\n\\n“dude. Does OP tell you to stop taking your anti acid pills your doctor recommended? “\\n\\n“That’s not the same thing. This is food not medication.”\\n\\n“I specifically heard you tell me your doctor told YOU not to eat X food groups and you wouldn’t need to take the anti acid pills. So unless you want us to judge YOU for ignoring doctors orders, leave op alone” (GO. GRANDMA. LOVE YOU. SO MUCH... even if you put bacon in my food without understanding why it was bad. But you stopped when I asked you not to, so we gucchi).\\n\\nSo....I know that was a long rant. But. My point: when I lie about being vegan to the awful people in my family, or awful people in general... it solves so many problems and allows me to live my life. I don’t want to be an activist right now given how bad and abusive my family was growing up. But, is lying unethical, and contributing to the problem even more, and I should be willing to take the hostility ?\\n\\nWhen my family suspected I’d become vegan, the anger was INSANE. They literally told me I was lying to do them for X, Y, and Z reasons. They went off on how I was judging them for their choices and I needed to stop bullying them and just eat the dam food. And until I finally lied, telling them it was my doctors advice.... they kept getting worse.\\n\\nNow. I am away from those family members now. But.... I just dont think I can handle the hostility associated with activism. But I can not contribute to the problem. Is this okay?</td>\n",

I'm 35, British, male, and live in Rome, Italy. The Friday after we locked down here for covid (Friday 6th March) I idly wondered if I could manage to not eat dairy, meat or fish for a week - well, that felt good and manageable, so it became a month and now I'm a year in. Thought I should share my experiences in case anybody wants to hear it\\n\\nweight - I lost it, I'm about 6'2 and weighed around 81kg (I didn't regularly weigh myself before going vegan) - summer last year I'd sometimes be as little as 73 kg (but I think that's cos sometimes in the summer you feel you don't need to eat much). I've settled at about 75kg and I'm still eating an awful lot while doing hardly any exercise\\n\\nMuscle definition is better, more pronounced, I nearly have abs, waist goes in more, though I think I'm still using the same hole on my belt\\n\\nSkin - far better, old marks (not scars, but just things that are about orange or purpley which have appeared without reason at some time or another on my skin, are fading or have faded completely. Mosquito bites seem to heal more quickly too. \\n\\nSkin on body is also somehow softer/ smoother - tricky one to describe\\n\\nskin on face - basically no breakouts now (fingers crossed) . I was certainly still annoying getting spots now and then despite being well past my teenage years, but now my skin is clear, though wearing a mask all day a lot of the time cos of covid often dries out the skin just to the side of my nose, but then we'll have half term (I'm a teacher) and I wear masks way less and it's clear that's just down to the masks\\n\\nLast time, in the 6 month update I wrote about possibly being less wrinkly, dunno about that\\n\\nface is definitely leaner though, cheekbones more pronounced\\n\\nnose is less stuffy/ blocked - used to be I would put those strips on my nose to keep the nostrils open while I slept, now I don't need them\\n\\nThink I'm sleeping better\\n\\nThink possibly, I'm recovering faster when I do go for a run (my main form of exercises). I haven't been running regularly recently, but when I have I feel like that soreness I'd sometimes get in my thighs - Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness is the name I think, is lesser than I might expect. It seems that plant-based athletes recover more quickly and can train more as a result - I'm hardly an example of this but did think I should say. About a month ago I managed to run 12k on Saturday morning and then 10 on the Sunday  - not sure I've done that much on successive days since Jan 2018 (I'd done a marathon in 2017 and wanted to better my time, but ended up injuring myself). My usual run ( is 5-8 km), Wasn't particularly sore afterwards after that weekend either\\n\\nMy nails are growing more quickly, I'm basically wolverine\\n\\npeople talk about having more energy - I don't know about that, I've always had loads of energy from first thing in the morning onwards (once was nicknamed the duracell bunny)\\n\\nPossibly TMI stuff - so feel free to avoid\\n\\nBO - dramatically reduced, to the degree that I don't bother with deodorant any more (before I used to use one of those deo blocks from lush). I don't work in construction or a really physical job or anything, but it does get hot obviously here in Italy, and even after i go running or whatever my tee-shirts and my armpits don't smell too bad\\n\\nDigestion - I've never had a problem with constipation, always attributing this to plenty of exercise and fruit, but shall we say, I have even less of a problem now. Perhaps I used to make 1 or 2 \"sitting visits\" to the bathroom every day, now it's more like 3 or 4 - suppose I might be spending more on toilet paper - is this why being vegan is generally thought to be so expensive? For the first few days though, digestion was interesting, I didn't have diarrhoea or anything, but ready access to a toilet was useful, luckily I was working from home - it even came out green a few times\\n\\nErections - feel like they're harder, perhaps last longer and perhaps that my \"recovery time\" is less. Used to be, after I came that'd be it for that session and the little guy was having a rest for a few hours, but lately, I reckon round 2 might be on the cards. Also, I did wonder, months back, whether I'd gotten slightly bigger when hard, than usual, not so that anyone else would notice, it's not like I gained inches, but it felt slightly different in my hand - could just be that that's because it's harder, or maybe I really did gain something (in girth). This doesn't really matter, it could all be in my head (I typed hand there accidentally lol) it's not about to affect my relationship, the difference, if there is one, is minimal, but wanted to put it out there. Dunno if my cum tastes better, sorry. \\n\\nend of the TMI\\n\\nThink eating plant-based has helped me with a long-term injury, I got illiotibial band syndrome in Jan 2018 and since then have alternately rested and down lots of stretching and exercises to strengthen and heal it, and sometimes run, while takign care to try to not to worsen it. It seems almost healed now (plant foods should have helped with inflammation in theory) - trouble is I complicated it on one of my occasional runs (before going plant-based) and managed to give myself hip bursitis/ trochanteritis - though this is also getting better, and I also attribute it's getting better partly to Time, the great healer, and partly to my diet. \\n\\nHonestly, I don't see myself eating meat, fish or dairy again, I'm really happy with my diet, and as time goes on, and now I find the animals rights and environmental reasons equally compelling. My friends and family know I'm vegan, and I've been encouraging them to try it, colleagues at work know and gently take the piss, but they can see that I'm the healthiest person there I mean, I prob was before too, so for me that makes it more compelling - I didn't have too much spare weight on me as far as I was concerned, or any worrying health problems, but all these unexpected benefits happened. At the same time as safeguarding my future health, I'm able to advocate for animal rights and be more environmentally friendly.\\n\\nSome resources I've found really helpful are Mic the vegan on youtube\\n\\nMichael Greger's how not to die book, and his website nutritionfacts\\n\\nplant-based news on youtube is good too\\n\\nThanks for reading, and sorry for the long post\\n\\nTL:DR\\n\\nI've been plant-based for a year and it's great, I don't see myself going back</td>\n",

too much spare weight on me as far as i was concerned  or any worrying health problems  but all these unexpected benefits happened  at the same time as safeguarding my future health  i'm able to advocate for animal rights and be more environmentally friendly   some resources i've found really helpful are mic the vegan on youtube  michael greger's how not to die book  and his website nutritionfacts  plant based news on youtube is good too  thanks for reading  and sorry for the long post  tl dr  i've been plant based for a year and it's great  i don't see myself going back</td>\n",

       "      <td>(i posted this to the cosmic skeptic (youtube dude and vegan) reddit about a week ago and then just found this sub. Being the upvote whore that i am, i thought i would copy paste it in case anyone here cared :p)\\n\\nThis post ended up being really long and rambling, so im adding this at the start. TL;DR i went from meat lover to vegan almost literally overnight because of Alex's arguments for veganism, and the documentary \"land of hope and glory\" by Earthling Ed was what pushed me over the edge and finally made me abandon my cognitive dissonance and excuses i was making.\\n\\nI dont know if he reads anything on this sub, but if by any chance Alex sees this, then thank you for all your work and opening my eyes to the immense amount of suffering and death that i have been supporting all my life up until this point.\\n\\nIve been watching for a while, mainly interested in the philosophical arguments after watching atheist experience for a number of years, and honestly, when he first started doing veganism related content, i wasnt very interested and only flicked through a couple of videos not really paying attention. But something stuck in my mind and eventually i came back to watch a bunch of it fully, and i came to the realization that there is simply no valid argument (at least for someone in my position) for consuming animal products in the way i did. I resisted at first, mainly using a pretty lazy and nihilistic justification of \"well, im such a small cog in the machine, what im doing makes no REAL difference\"...But i felt a pang of guilt every time i ate meat. This lasted, i think, several months.\\n\\nThen roughly a week or so ago, i sat down (with a pork sausage sandwich) and started browsing youtube videos, and i come across podcast #9 with Earthling Ed ([https://youtu.be/r-BTN8Ajs04](https://youtu.be/r-BTN8Ajs04)). I watch for a little while and am hit with the same guilt ive been feeling more and more often as (what i now recognize to be...) my cognitive dissonance starts to break down. Partway through the video Earthling Ed's documentary \"land of hope and glory\" was mentioned (i had never heard of him or any of his work before watching the interview - link to the documentary &amp;gt; [https://www.landofhopeandglory.org/](https://www.landofhopeandglory.org/)) and i was curious, so i paused that video and googled it, and started watching. The pork sausage sandwich is about half eaten at this point.\\n\\nAs much as i kind of hate overly dramatic language like this, i dont think its an exaggeration to say that video changed my life. I had heard before about the process of slaughtering animals, about how they were stunned with a boltgun and then had their throats cut, or how pigs were put into gas chambers. But i had never actually been confronted with it. Never been forced to witness an actual intelligent living animal screaming in pain and terror and clawing at the cage around it as it suffocated to death. Or witnessing a cow fail to be stunned in a setting right out of a cheesy torture-porn horror movie and have its throat slashed while still conscious and its horrific writhing as it bleeds to death. And as silly as it sounds, i remember looking at that sausage sandwich on my desk and something finally clicked in my head and i no longer saw it as just a tasty lunch, but as a lump of dead meat from a tortured animal. And i simply could not finish that sandwich, i even tried to reason with myself that it was just a waste of food to throw it away at this point, but i just couldn't stomach it.\\n\\nAnd from there, the floodgates had opened, i realized that if i couldn't eat meat anymore, then milk and cheese were off the table too, since those industries were just as bad for all the same reasons. Fish i found were more difficult to empathize with, and i almost flirted with the idea of going vegan except still consuming fish, until i mentally slapped myself with how silly that idea was. \"can fish really feel pain? i swear i read they couldnt...\" a quick google informed me that, yes, fish have nervous systems and therefore feel pain, duhhhhh. And of course i realized that ive always found the Japanese whaling industry incredibly problematic, so why am i applying those standards to large sealife but not smaller ones?\\n\\nIve not been vegan long now, as i said, about a week. But honestly, what has surprised me most is this...ITS SO EASY. I had this idea in my head before that i would have to be some sort of ridiculous \"taste martyr\" to be vegan and exist off of salad and nuts for the rest of my life... and then i had my first vegan sausage and realised, if i didnt know better, I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS MEAT. Alternative cheese, butter, milk, chicken, sausages etc... it all tastes really good?! What the hell?! Why isnt this better known?! As for health, my diet has been quickly improving, im still consuming wayyyyy too much sugar (im far too addicted to fizzy drinks) But im eating far more leafy greens, veg and fruit, and im really enjoying it!\\n\\nThe only problem im having now is trying not to be the \"preachy vegan\" to my family. I dont know whats right at this point, to live and let live, or to really try and push what ive learned on those close to me. I almost feel obligated to try and spread the message at this point as penance for all the suffering ive caused.\\n\\nThis was wayyyy longer than i meant to make it and if you made it this far, thankyou for listening to my rambling.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The very fact that one is alive means consuming nutrients ... and staying alive means that something, somewhere, must die in order to supply these nutrients. This is a fact of life ... and the marvellous thing about a fact is that one can not argue with it. One can argue about a belief, an opinion, a theory, an ideal and so on ... but a fact: never. One can deny a fact – pretend that it is not there – but once seen, a fact brings freedom from choice and decision. Most people think and feel that choice implies freedom – having the freedom to choose – but this is not the case. Freedom lies in seeing the obvious, and in seeing the obvious there is no choice, no deliberation, no agonising over the ‘Right’ and ‘Wrong’ judgment. In the freedom of seeing the fact there is only action.\\n\\nWhen it comes to the consumption of nutrients there are many and various beliefs one can hold dearly to. There are people who will not eat red meat at all ... only white meat and fish. Then there are people who will not eat any flesh of warm-blooded animals at all ... only fish and reptiles. Then there are people (**vegetarians**) who will not eat any meat at all, but will consume eggs and dairy products. Then there are people (**vegans**) who will eat only vegetables, grain and seed. Then there are people (**fruitarians**) who will only eat fruit. Then – as we go into myth and fantasy – there are those who live on water and air ... and finally those who live on air only!\\n\\nSome vegetarians maintain that as a carrot (for example) does not scream audibly when it is pulled from the ground there is no distress caused by the consumption of vegetables. Yet the carrot indubitably dies slowly by being extracted from its life-support system – the ground is its home – and is this not distressing on some level of a living, growing organism? It all depends upon the level, or degree, of ‘aliveness’ that one ascribes to things. Vegans, for instance, will not consume eggs as this prevents an incipient life from being born. Fruitarians go one step further and say that, as the consumption of carrots prevents them from going to seed and sprouting new life, vegetables are to be eschewed entirely. Then, as the eating of grain and seeds also prevent potential life-forms from growing, they will eat only the flesh of the fruit that surrounds the kernel and plant out the embryo plant-form (I have been a fruitarian so I know full well what I am speaking of).\\n\\nThe obvious fact is clearly demonstrated by taking all this to its ultimate consideration. What will one do – as a fruitarian causing no pain or the taking of life of anyone or anything – about those pesky things like mosquitoes, sand-flies, cockroaches, rats, mice and other ‘vermin’ that invade my house? Put up screens? What about outside? Will I slap them dead ... or just shoo them away? What will one do if attacked by a snake, a crocodile, a shark, a lion and so on? Do as the Revered Scriptures say and turn the other cheek? Will I humbly submit to my fate and be mauled severely myself – or even killed – simply because of a religious injunction, a moral scruple, a noble ideal, a virtuous belief, a passionate opinion, a deeply held ethical theory? In other words, have animals and insects been given the right, by some inscrutable god, to do with me whatsoever they wish? Is my survival dependent upon the non-existent benevolence of all those sentient beings that I am not going to cause distress to?\\n\\nWhat then about germs, bacteria, bacillus, microbes, pathogens, phages, viruses and so on? Are they not entitled to remain alive and pain free? If one takes medication for disease, one is – possibly painfully – killing off the microscopic creatures that one’s body is the host too. Some religions – the Jain religion in India, for example – has its devout members wearing gauze over their nose and mouths to prevent insects from flying in and they even carry small brooms to sweep the path as they walk so that they will not accidentally step on some creature. It can really get out of hand. For instance, small-pox has been eradicated from the world by scientists as a means of saving countless human lives ... is this somehow ‘Wrong’? What is ‘Right’ in regards to what I do in order to stay alive? If I do none of these things then I will be causing pain and suffering to myself ... and I am a sentient being too. It is an impossible scenario, when pursued to its ultimate conclusion.\\n\\nAnd then there is the matter of one’s fellow human beings. Some of them – in fact at times a lot of them – are desirous of invading the country that one is living peacefully in, with the avowed intent of killing, torturing, raping, pillaging and subjugating oneself and one’s fellow citizens. If one holds a strong and passionate belief in not causing any pain and suffering to other sentient beings then one must be more than a fruitarian ... one must be a pacifist as well. This amounts to hanging out a sign – if everybody else in the country one lives in adopts this specific belief – which says, in effect: ‘Please feel free to invade us, we will not fight back, for we hold firmly to the principle of not causing pain and suffering to any sentient being whatsoever’ (the Tibetan situation is a particular case in point). Thus anarchy would rule the world ... all because of a belief system handed down by the Saints and the Sages, the Messiahs and the Avatars, the Redeemers and the Saviours, the Prophets and the Priests, century after century.</td>\n",

       "243  If this isn't allowed in r/vegan I'm sorry. Take the post down.\\n\\n\\---\\n\\nHello to all you wonderful green people of [r/vegan](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan)\\n\\nFirst of all I want to say three crucial things:\\n\\n\\#1 From the bottom of my heart, thank you for choosing compassion over fear and suffering. This is the most important thing we as vegans need to remember and remind ourselves each and every day if we are to live at peace with the fact that we are vegan in a non-vegan. \\n\\n\\#2 I hope to make it as straightforward as possible that my intention of writing this post is not about an egotistical gathering of attention to and around me and my work. Let me be the first to say that the most critical voice that I will ever hear about what I do is my own voice. This post is because I'd like to stretch a hand of compassion and offer an opportunity to those who resonate with me. This project of mine has been a considerable source of personal growth, and I'd like to try at least to inspire someone to join me. I'm doing this because this is what I would have liked to see more of in my own ideal world.\\n\\n\\#3 I hope to clarify that I don't sell anything, nor that I am going to. This post is not about trying to get people to WATCH my content. It's about asking WHAT the vegan community would like to see and hear more of. \\n\\nFor the animals, together we stand strong!\\n\\n\\---Abstract/TLDR---\\n\\nWhat kind of content would you, yourself, have wanted to see produced on YouTube? \\n\\nIs there anything I can help you with to make you start producing your own videos on YouTube? \\n\\nAre there any specific topics, questions, or things I can make to help people be inspired to become vegan or make vegans be inspired to become active for the animals? \\n\\nIs there any suffering (vystopia) which people struggle with, and I can help alleviate through inspiring videos and content on YouTube or otherwise? \\n\\nAny other questions, information, contact info about me, or anything else, please leave a comment. It would mean the whole world to me to get feedback from you.\\n\\n\\---lengthy post with lots of details about who I am, where I'm from, what drives me and why I do what I do follows--- \\n\\nSo basically what drives, and makes me want to innovate is largely fuelled by the profound amount of energy, and gratitude I get from just the simple fact of being vegan, from just having the flame and feeling within me of the knowledge that every day that I live life, I'm sparing animals from being killed. That is what I fundamentally want to pass on to the other people of the vegan community. I really want to help alleviate the suffering people feel about how humanity is treating animals. I want to help people see and realize that we do the things we do to animals because we are unconscious. \\n\\nThis is what the brand I have created since November 2020 has turned into today. \\n\\nMetta Sutta Vegan Activism:\\n\\nThe name \"Metta Sutta\" is inspired by a Buddhist text about the cultivation of goodwill, and it's something I really found inspiring because it's what we as vegans do towards animals.\\n\\nThis is what I've been doing in the vegan community the last few weeks (I've only recently started being active)\\n\\n\\*I've been active in Facebook comments on agricultural/vegan groups for the last month \\n\\n\\*Me and my girlfriend started a podcast (Norwegian podcast) this easter - it's gotten great responses from our closest vegan friends and the community!\\n\\n\\*I have invested around 2000 dollars in hardware for creating high-quality videos: mirrorless camera, professional recording software, microphones, website, ads, etc...\\n\\n\\*Recently, I started producing videos on YouTube. This will be my primary focus from now on. I'm working intensely on upgrading the quality of those videos by working on myself, which is a major reason as to why I'm asking the community for feedback and constructive criticism.\\n\\n\\*Recently started a Metta Sutta Instagram where me and my girlfriend will be collecting and posting inspirational videos, quotes and all things that makes the hearts of vegans melt in joy from the love of animals.\\n\\n\\*Recently became active in reddit (this account is 3 days old :) )\\n\\nI know me posting this may be something that I regret doing \"too soon.\" Still, I would rather get some genuine feedback about my work thus far, and hopefully some guidance on where to go from now on and, hopefully, find someone that would like to connect more with me. \\n\\nFrom the understanding that the reason we as a human race do these things to animals stems from an unconscious state of mind, we as vegans can ourselves become liberated from the constant judging, and maybe more fully start to communicate to the meat-eaters in more effective ways? That's my highest hope, and I wish someone has some thoughts about how we can do this. I've read the book \"A Plea for the Animals\" by a Buddhist monk called Matthieu Ricard and recently listened to \"The Joyful Vegan\" by Colleen Patrick-Goudreau. I find these books highly inspiring, and I want to pass along that inspiration in video and podcast format. And what I'm hoping is that if anyone resonates with anything written here, I would like you to get to know me a little better and work together to find out how to speak our truth to the world more effectively.\\n\\nI'm trying to offer to create a place, a circle of innovation and inspiration that will hopefully blossom into a beautiful space of support and clarity, and my highest wish is that you would be a part of it!\\n\\n\\---\\n\\nA little bit more about me: I'm 22 years old, I've been vegan for 1,5 years now, and l live in Norway. When I first went vegan, I was met with so much resistance from family, friends, and the society around me, and the path from the transition to veganism to the present day, has been a really hard, but rich learning experience. What I really want to do with my work is to inspire vegans to live happily with the knowing that they are doing the right thing, as well as (hopefully) helping meat-eaters realize that choosing compassion is the right choice.\\n\\nHow our truth needs to be spoken is in a way that connects with those people's minds, at their stage of development, through the heart, in a way that's relatable, in my opinion. \\n\\nIf anyone is interested in checking me out, I do have a website: [www.mettasutta.net](https://www.mettasutta.net/) \\- although I'd like to mention that the website is not fully finished yet, it's under construction. Alternatively check out my youtube channel. I recently deleted all my videos from other channels, and reuploaded the best I've made thus far on my main channel \"Metta Sutta\". Some are English, some are Norwegian.  \\n[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAkJcRMcWoY2fsJBF5uXCTQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAkJcRMcWoY2fsJBF5uXCTQ)  \\nIf there is anything particularly good or bad about my videos thus far, feedback is highly appreciated.   \\n\\n\\nI will be actively responding to whatever does (or doesn't) come out of this post. I'm a little bit giddy, and nervous, but at the same time inspired and grateful for doing this.\\n\\nI'm hoping that I can use the responses I get from everyone in the r/vegan subreddit to better see myself clearly and how I need to align myself going forward, to better help the animals that are suffering every day! \\n\\nIf there are any spelling errors, or there is some clarification that's needed, please let me know!   \n",

Is it okay ethically to not reveal you are vegan to those around you when they keep questioning it, noticing that all your “excuses” seemingly align with vegan outcomes?\\n\\nIn terms of health...I watched my father die of cancer. It broke me. Every time I see the animal products he consumed a lot of....I think of the agony he went through in the last stages of his life....and I can’t bring myself to bring that pain into my life again...so I immediately go for whole food plants to hopefully prevent it.\\n\\nA lot of my family heavily argues cancer is just in the family line. While I disagree with them, I’m not a doctor so I don’t know how educated I am on the topic, so I stay quiet.\\n\\nMy father got cancer. His father got cancer. Both died in their 50s long before they should have... both the kindness members of the family... sad face.\\n\\nEveryone (in former associations I had with them, when we would regularly eat together... we don’t do it anymore because of ... reasons... see profile for irrelevant explanation of that...) heavily argued non stop that my grandfathers death was genetic.\\n\\nThing is.... they eat so much god dam meat. Every meal: \\nMeat: red meat; fish; chicken; or some other former sentient animals flesh.\\n\\nSo much bacon. Ungodly amounts of bacon. So much so, that when my loving grandmother made me a bean soup (she’s the only one who I told I was plant based. But she’s not the brightest person and never understood it, so this wasn’t intentional on her part, trust me): she put bacon in the sauce to flavor it. Thinking it was fine since it was only a bit.\\n\\nDairy: cheese, so much god dam cheese; milk; \\n\\nWhen I was a young child I naturally consumed The same foods, up until about 15.\\n\\nLooking back, my symptoms were INSANE and really bad, such that I’m surprised I never considered the food I was eating could be causing me to have these issues.\\n\\nRashes: EVERYWHERE. For arms. Shins. Oh my god dam fingers. Bottom of my feet. It was so bad. Even when I didn’t scratch it would get worse, and when I did scratch I’d get blamed by my family for it getting to that point. “It’s only that bad because you scratch. If you stopped it would go away. (Nah it’s not the food at all). I’d wake up 3 days a week seeing blood everywhere on my bed from the scraps opening up.)\\n\\nCravings: I’d go through non stop physical shakes if I didn’t  have dairy products 3 times a week. My loving father had to limit My ice cream consumption to 3 days a week because I was ballooning up. But i was always trying... my best.. I swear... but the cravings kept getting more and more intense until I gave in.\\n\\nDepression and fatigue. NON STOP FATIGUE. I’d be told by family that I just wasn’t eating enough, them proudly patting their ballooned stomach. I forced myself to eat more of the garbage food. I definitely ate more, but my fatigue got worse and I gained weight \\n\\n\\nAll of this is to just show.. how sick and tired I was of my health feeling like garbage. So I stoped. I told family My decision to just limit (l said lying, knowing i wasn’t eating any behind closed doors) animal products. So please , if they cook, just give me the non animal based parts of the meal.  I’d be more than happy to bring my own food if the entire meal is animal based tho, they had to do NOTHING extra.\\n\\nFirst: they asked why. I explained that I was trying to see if changing my diet could help my symptoms. They told me I was being silly, it wasn’t the food. And that I needed to keep eating these health calorie dense foods, it’s in our DNA!\\n\\nSecond: when the above strategy did not work, and it became clear that for about 2 months I had not gave up (skin improving before their eyes. But they ignored that, claiming I was just not scratching... I was still scratching a lot. They didn’t believe me). They tried a new strategy: guilt tripping me.\\n\\nThey told me I could 100% “cheat” 1 day a week and my health would be fine. When I told them “cheating requires me to want to eat those foods because it brings pleasure, and I don’t get pleasure from the side effects I do still get after eating it, so I don’t “cheat” with foods that cause pain... they god mad.\\n\\n“Oh. So your grandmother slaves over a stove and you are going to be disrespectful and not eat it? Wow.”\\n\\n“No. I do eat the food she makes. See, I’m right now eating plain pasta. L\\n\\n“It’s rude to not eat everything. You are insinuating she’s doing a bad job and making you sick. That’s rude”\\n\\n“What? No, I’m just trying to figure out symptoms by isolating my diet to foods that work. And if I add something in it will show me if my reaction is negative. “\\n\\n“I disagree. It’s rude. “\\n\\n“(Seeing no other way out, I lied) my doctor told me to do this. Are you telling me I should ignore my doctor? “\\n\\nThis shut down all complaints. Once I tied it into “my doctor told me to do this”, they had a difficult time arguing back that I’m being rude. Although they did try, and the sane people at the table would go \\n\\n“dude. Does OP tell you to stop taking your anti acid pills your doctor recommended? “\\n\\n“That’s not the same thing. This is food not medication.”\\n\\n“I specifically heard you tell me your doctor told YOU not to eat X food groups and you wouldn’t need to take the anti acid pills. So unless you want us to judge YOU for ignoring doctors orders, leave op alone” (GO. GRANDMA. LOVE YOU. SO MUCH... even if you put bacon in my food without understanding why it was bad. But you stopped when I asked you not to, so we gucchi).\\n\\nSo....I know that was a long rant. But. My point: when I lie about being vegan to the awful people in my family, or awful people in general... it solves so many problems and allows me to live my life. I don’t want to be an activist right now given how bad and abusive my family was growing up. But, is lying unethical, and contributing to the problem even more, and I should be willing to take the hostility ?\\n\\nWhen my family suspected I’d become vegan, the anger was INSANE. They literally told me I was lying to do them for X, Y, and Z reasons. They went off on how I was judging them for their choices and I needed to stop bullying them and just eat the dam food. And until I finally lied, telling them it was my doctors advice.... they kept getting worse.\\n\\nNow. I am away from those family members now. But.... I just dont think I can handle the hostility associated with activism. But I can not contribute to the problem. Is this okay?   \n",

I'm 35, British, male, and live in Rome, Italy. The Friday after we locked down here for covid (Friday 6th March) I idly wondered if I could manage to not eat dairy, meat or fish for a week - well, that felt good and manageable, so it became a month and now I'm a year in. Thought I should share my experiences in case anybody wants to hear it\\n\\nweight - I lost it, I'm about 6'2 and weighed around 81kg (I didn't regularly weigh myself before going vegan) - summer last year I'd sometimes be as little as 73 kg (but I think that's cos sometimes in the summer you feel you don't need to eat much). I've settled at about 75kg and I'm still eating an awful lot while doing hardly any exercise\\n\\nMuscle definition is better, more pronounced, I nearly have abs, waist goes in more, though I think I'm still using the same hole on my belt\\n\\nSkin - far better, old marks (not scars, but just things that are about orange or purpley which have appeared without reason at some time or another on my skin, are fading or have faded completely. Mosquito bites seem to heal more quickly too. \\n\\nSkin on body is also somehow softer/ smoother - tricky one to describe\\n\\nskin on face - basically no breakouts now (fingers crossed) . I was certainly still annoying getting spots now and then despite being well past my teenage years, but now my skin is clear, though wearing a mask all day a lot of the time cos of covid often dries out the skin just to the side of my nose, but then we'll have half term (I'm a teacher) and I wear masks way less and it's clear that's just down to the masks\\n\\nLast time, in the 6 month update I wrote about possibly being less wrinkly, dunno about that\\n\\nface is definitely leaner though, cheekbones more pronounced\\n\\nnose is less stuffy/ blocked - used to be I would put those strips on my nose to keep the nostrils open while I slept, now I don't need them\\n\\nThink I'm sleeping better\\n\\nThink possibly, I'm recovering faster when I do go for a run (my main form of exercises). I haven't been running regularly recently, but when I have I feel like that soreness I'd sometimes get in my thighs - Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness is the name I think, is lesser than I might expect. It seems that plant-based athletes recover more quickly and can train more as a result - I'm hardly an example of this but did think I should say. About a month ago I managed to run 12k on Saturday morning and then 10 on the Sunday  - not sure I've done that much on successive days since Jan 2018 (I'd done a marathon in 2017 and wanted to better my time, but ended up injuring myself). My usual run ( is 5-8 km), Wasn't particularly sore afterwards after that weekend either\\n\\nMy nails are growing more quickly, I'm basically wolverine\\n\\npeople talk about having more energy - I don't know about that, I've always had loads of energy from first thing in the morning onwards (once was nicknamed the duracell bunny)\\n\\nPossibly TMI stuff - so feel free to avoid\\n\\nBO - dramatically reduced, to the degree that I don't bother with deodorant any more (before I used to use one of those deo blocks from lush). I don't work in construction or a really physical job or anything, but it does get hot obviously here in Italy, and even after i go running or whatever my tee-shirts and my armpits don't smell too bad\\n\\nDigestion - I've never had a problem with constipation, always attributing this to plenty of exercise and fruit, but shall we say, I have even less of a problem now. Perhaps I used to make 1 or 2 \"sitting visits\" to the bathroom every day, now it's more like 3 or 4 - suppose I might be spending more on toilet paper - is this why being vegan is generally thought to be so expensive? For the first few days though, digestion was interesting, I didn't have diarrhoea or anything, but ready access to a toilet was useful, luckily I was working from home - it even came out green a few times\\n\\nErections - feel like they're harder, perhaps last longer and perhaps that my \"recovery time\" is less. Used to be, after I came that'd be it for that session and the little guy was having a rest for a few hours, but lately, I reckon round 2 might be on the cards. Also, I did wonder, months back, whether I'd gotten slightly bigger when hard, than usual, not so that anyone else would notice, it's not like I gained inches, but it felt slightly different in my hand - could just be that that's because it's harder, or maybe I really did gain something (in girth). This doesn't really matter, it could all be in my head (I typed hand there accidentally lol) it's not about to affect my relationship, the difference, if there is one, is minimal, but wanted to put it out there. Dunno if my cum tastes better, sorry. \\n\\nend of the TMI\\n\\nThink eating plant-based has helped me with a long-term injury, I got illiotibial band syndrome in Jan 2018 and since then have alternately rested and down lots of stretching and exercises to strengthen and heal it, and sometimes run, while takign care to try to not to worsen it. It seems almost healed now (plant foods should have helped with inflammation in theory) - trouble is I complicated it on one of my occasional runs (before going plant-based) and managed to give myself hip bursitis/ trochanteritis - though this is also getting better, and I also attribute it's getting better partly to Time, the great healer, and partly to my diet. \\n\\nHonestly, I don't see myself eating meat, fish or dairy again, I'm really happy with my diet, and as time goes on, and now I find the animals rights and environmental reasons equally compelling. My friends and family know I'm vegan, and I've been encouraging them to try it, colleagues at work know and gently take the piss, but they can see that I'm the healthiest person there I mean, I prob was before too, so for me that makes it more compelling - I didn't have too much spare weight on me as far as I was concerned, or any worrying health problems, but all these unexpected benefits happened. At the same time as safeguarding my future health, I'm able to advocate for animal rights and be more environmentally friendly.\\n\\nSome resources I've found really helpful are Mic the vegan on youtube\\n\\nMichael Greger's how not to die book, and his website nutritionfacts\\n\\nplant-based news on youtube is good too\\n\\nThanks for reading, and sorry for the long post\\n\\nTL:DR\\n\\nI've been plant-based for a year and it's great, I don't see myself going back   \n",

Being the upvote whore that i am, i thought i would copy paste it in case anyone here cared :p)\\n\\nThis post ended up being really long and rambling, so im adding this at the start. TL;DR i went from meat lover to vegan almost literally overnight because of Alex's arguments for veganism, and the documentary \"land of hope and glory\" by Earthling Ed was what pushed me over the edge and finally made me abandon my cognitive dissonance and excuses i was making.\\n\\nI dont know if he reads anything on this sub, but if by any chance Alex sees this, then thank you for all your work and opening my eyes to the immense amount of suffering and death that i have been supporting all my life up until this point.\\n\\nIve been watching for a while, mainly interested in the philosophical arguments after watching atheist experience for a number of years, and honestly, when he first started doing veganism related content, i wasnt very interested and only flicked through a couple of videos not really paying attention. But something stuck in my mind and eventually i came back to watch a bunch of it fully, and i came to the realization that there is simply no valid argument (at least for someone in my position) for consuming animal products in the way i did. I resisted at first, mainly using a pretty lazy and nihilistic justification of \"well, im such a small cog in the machine, what im doing makes no REAL difference\"...But i felt a pang of guilt every time i ate meat. This lasted, i think, several months.\\n\\nThen roughly a week or so ago, i sat down (with a pork sausage sandwich) and started browsing youtube videos, and i come across podcast #9 with Earthling Ed ([https://youtu.be/r-BTN8Ajs04](https://youtu.be/r-BTN8Ajs04)). I watch for a little while and am hit with the same guilt ive been feeling more and more often as (what i now recognize to be...) my cognitive dissonance starts to break down. Partway through the video Earthling Ed's documentary \"land of hope and glory\" was mentioned (i had never heard of him or any of his work before watching the interview - link to the documentary &gt; [https://www.landofhopeandglory.org/](https://www.landofhopeandglory.org/)) and i was curious, so i paused that video and googled it, and started watching. The pork sausage sandwich is about half eaten at this point.\\n\\nAs much as i kind of hate overly dramatic language like this, i dont think its an exaggeration to say that video changed my life. I had heard before about the process of slaughtering animals, about how they were stunned with a boltgun and then had their throats cut, or how pigs were put into gas chambers. But i had never actually been confronted with it. Never been forced to witness an actual intelligent living animal screaming in pain and terror and clawing at the cage around it as it suffocated to death. Or witnessing a cow fail to be stunned in a setting right out of a cheesy torture-porn horror movie and have its throat slashed while still conscious and its horrific writhing as it bleeds to death. And as silly as it sounds, i remember looking at that sausage sandwich on my desk and something finally clicked in my head and i no longer saw it as just a tasty lunch, but as a lump of dead meat from a tortured animal. And i simply could not finish that sandwich, i even tried to reason with myself that it was just a waste of food to throw it away at this point, but i just couldn't stomach it.\\n\\nAnd from there, the floodgates had opened, i realized that if i couldn't eat meat anymore, then milk and cheese were off the table too, since those industries were just as bad for all the same reasons. Fish i found were more difficult to empathize with, and i almost flirted with the idea of going vegan except still consuming fish, until i mentally slapped myself with how silly that idea was. \"can fish really feel pain? i swear i read they couldnt...\" a quick google informed me that, yes, fish have nervous systems and therefore feel pain, duhhhhh. And of course i realized that ive always found the Japanese whaling industry incredibly problematic, so why am i applying those standards to large sealife but not smaller ones?\\n\\nIve not been vegan long now, as i said, about a week. But honestly, what has surprised me most is this...ITS SO EASY. I had this idea in my head before that i would have to be some sort of ridiculous \"taste martyr\" to be vegan and exist off of salad and nuts for the rest of my life... and then i had my first vegan sausage and realised, if i didnt know better, I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS MEAT. Alternative cheese, butter, milk, chicken, sausages etc... it all tastes really good?! What the hell?! Why isnt this better known?! As for health, my diet has been quickly improving, im still consuming wayyyyy too much sugar (im far too addicted to fizzy drinks) But im eating far more leafy greens, veg and fruit, and im really enjoying it!\\n\\nThe only problem im having now is trying not to be the \"preachy vegan\" to my family. I dont know whats right at this point, to live and let live, or to really try and push what ive learned on those close to me. I almost feel obligated to try and spread the message at this point as penance for all the suffering ive caused.\\n\\nThis was wayyyy longer than i meant to make it and if you made it this far, thankyou for listening to my rambling.   \n",

This is a fact of life ... and the marvellous thing about a fact is that one can not argue with it. One can argue about a belief, an opinion, a theory, an ideal and so on ... but a fact: never. One can deny a fact – pretend that it is not there – but once seen, a fact brings freedom from choice and decision. Most people think and feel that choice implies freedom – having the freedom to choose – but this is not the case. Freedom lies in seeing the obvious, and in seeing the obvious there is no choice, no deliberation, no agonising over the ‘Right’ and ‘Wrong’ judgment. In the freedom of seeing the fact there is only action.\\n\\nWhen it comes to the consumption of nutrients there are many and various beliefs one can hold dearly to. There are people who will not eat red meat at all ... only white meat and fish. Then there are people who will not eat any flesh of warm-blooded animals at all ... only fish and reptiles. Then there are people (**vegetarians**) who will not eat any meat at all, but will consume eggs and dairy products. Then there are people (**vegans**) who will eat only vegetables, grain and seed. Then there are people (**fruitarians**) who will only eat fruit. Then – as we go into myth and fantasy – there are those who live on water and air ... and finally those who live on air only!\\n\\nSome vegetarians maintain that as a carrot (for example) does not scream audibly when it is pulled from the ground there is no distress caused by the consumption of vegetables. Yet the carrot indubitably dies slowly by being extracted from its life-support system – the ground is its home – and is this not distressing on some level of a living, growing organism? It all depends upon the level, or degree, of ‘aliveness’ that one ascribes to things. Vegans, for instance, will not consume eggs as this prevents an incipient life from being born. Fruitarians go one step further and say that, as the consumption of carrots prevents them from going to seed and sprouting new life, vegetables are to be eschewed entirely. Then, as the eating of grain and seeds also prevent potential life-forms from growing, they will eat only the flesh of the fruit that surrounds the kernel and plant out the embryo plant-form (I have been a fruitarian so I know full well what I am speaking of).\\n\\nThe obvious fact is clearly demonstrated by taking all this to its ultimate consideration. What will one do – as a fruitarian causing no pain or the taking of life of anyone or anything – about those pesky things like mosquitoes, sand-flies, cockroaches, rats, mice and other ‘vermin’ that invade my house? Put up screens? What about outside? Will I slap them dead ... or just shoo them away? What will one do if attacked by a snake, a crocodile, a shark, a lion and so on? Do as the Revered Scriptures say and turn the other cheek? Will I humbly submit to my fate and be mauled severely myself – or even killed – simply because of a religious injunction, a moral scruple, a noble ideal, a virtuous belief, a passionate opinion, a deeply held ethical theory? In other words, have animals and insects been given the right, by some inscrutable god, to do with me whatsoever they wish? Is my survival dependent upon the non-existent benevolence of all those sentient beings that I am not going to cause distress to?\\n\\nWhat then about germs, bacteria, bacillus, microbes, pathogens, phages, viruses and so on? Are they not entitled to remain alive and pain free? If one takes medication for disease, one is – possibly painfully – killing off the microscopic creatures that one’s body is the host too. Some religions – the Jain religion in India, for example – has its devout members wearing gauze over their nose and mouths to prevent insects from flying in and they even carry small brooms to sweep the path as they walk so that they will not accidentally step on some creature. It can really get out of hand. For instance, small-pox has been eradicated from the world by scientists as a means of saving countless human lives ... is this somehow ‘Wrong’? What is ‘Right’ in regards to what I do in order to stay alive? If I do none of these things then I will be causing pain and suffering to myself ... and I am a sentient being too. It is an impossible scenario, when pursued to its ultimate conclusion.\\n\\nAnd then there is the matter of one’s fellow human beings. Some of them – in fact at times a lot of them – are desirous of invading the country that one is living peacefully in, with the avowed intent of killing, torturing, raping, pillaging and subjugating oneself and one’s fellow citizens. If one holds a strong and passionate belief in not causing any pain and suffering to other sentient beings then one must be more than a fruitarian ... one must be a pacifist as well. This amounts to hanging out a sign – if everybody else in the country one lives in adopts this specific belief – which says, in effect: ‘Please feel free to invade us, we will not fight back, for we hold firmly to the principle of not causing pain and suffering to any sentient being whatsoever’ (the Tibetan situation is a particular case in point). Thus anarchy would rule the world ... all because of a belief system handed down by the Saints and the Sages, the Messiahs and the Avatars, the Redeemers and the Saviours, the Prophets and the Priests, century after century.   \n",

       "243  if this isn't allowed in r vegan i'm sorry  take the post down         hello to all you wonderful green people of  r vegan  https   www reddit com r vegan   first of all i want to say three crucial things     1 from the bottom of my heart  thank you for choosing compassion over fear and suffering  this is the most important thing we as vegans need to remember and remind ourselves each and every day if we are to live at peace with the fact that we are vegan in a non vegan      2 i hope to make it as straightforward as possible that my intention of writing this post is not about an egotistical gathering of attention to and around me and my work  let me be the first to say that the most critical voice that i will ever hear about what i do is my own voice  this post is because i'd like to stretch a hand of compassion and offer an opportunity to those who resonate with me  this project of mine has been a considerable source of personal growth  and i'd like to try at least to inspire someone to join me  i'm doing this because this is what i would have liked to see more of in my own ideal world     3 i hope to clarify that i don't sell anything  nor that i am going to  this post is not about trying to get people to watch my content  it's about asking what the vegan community would like to see and hear more of    for the animals  together we stand strong       abstract tldr     what kind of content would you  yourself  have wanted to see produced on youtube    is there anything i can help you with to make you start producing your own videos on youtube    are there any specific topics  questions  or things i can make to help people be inspired to become vegan or make vegans be inspired to become active for the animals    is there any suffering  vystopia  which people struggle with  and i can help alleviate through inspiring videos and content on youtube or otherwise    any other questions  information  contact info about me  or anything else  please leave a comment  it would mean the whole world to me to get feedback from you       lengthy post with lots of details about who i am  where i'm from  what drives me and why i do what i do follows      so basically what drives  and makes me want to innovate is largely fuelled by the profound amount of energy  and gratitude i get from just the simple fact of being vegan  from just having the flame and feeling within me of the knowledge that every day that i live life  i'm sparing animals from being killed  that is what i fundamentally want to pass on to the other people of the vegan community  i really want to help alleviate the suffering people feel about how humanity is treating animals  i want to help people see and realize that we do the things we do to animals because we are unconscious    this is what the brand i have created since november 2020 has turned into today    metta sutta vegan activism   the name  metta sutta  is inspired by a buddhist text about the cultivation of goodwill  and it's something i really found inspiring because it's what we as vegans do towards animals   this is what i've been doing in the vegan community the last few weeks  i've only recently started being active     i've been active in facebook comments on agricultural vegan groups for the last month     me and my girlfriend started a podcast  norwegian podcast  this easter   it's gotten great responses from our closest vegan friends and the community     i have invested around 2000 dollars in hardware for creating high quality videos  mirrorless camera  professional recording software  microphones  website  ads  etc       recently  i started producing videos on youtube  this will be my primary focus from now on  i'm working intensely on upgrading the quality of those videos by working on myself  which is a major reason as to why i'm asking the community for feedback and constructive criticism     recently started a metta sutta instagram where me and my girlfriend will be collecting and posting inspirational videos  quotes and all things that makes the hearts of vegans melt in joy from the love of animals     recently became active in reddit  this account is 3 days old       i know me posting this may be something that i regret doing  too soon   still  i would rather get some genuine feedback about my work thus far  and hopefully some guidance on where to go from now on and  hopefully  find someone that would like to connect more with me    from the understanding that the reason we as a human race do these things to animals stems from an unconscious state of mind  we as vegans can ourselves become liberated from the constant judging  and maybe more fully start to communicate to the meat eaters in more effective ways  that's my highest hope  and i wish someone has some thoughts about how we can do this  i've read the book  a plea for the animals  by a buddhist monk called matthieu ricard and recently listened to  the joyful vegan  by colleen patrick goudreau  i find these books highly inspiring  and i want to pass along that inspiration in video and podcast format  and what i'm hoping is that if anyone resonates with anything written here  i would like you to get to know me a little better and work together to find out how to speak our truth to the world more effectively   i'm trying to offer to create a place  a circle of innovation and inspiration that will hopefully blossom into a beautiful space of support and clarity  and my highest wish is that you would be a part of it         a little bit more about me  i'm 22 years old  i've been vegan for 1 5 years now  and l live in norway  when i first went vegan  i was met with so much resistance from family  friends  and the society around me  and the path from the transition to veganism to the present day  has been a really hard  but rich learning experience  what i really want to do with my work is to inspire vegans to live happily with the knowing that they are doing the right thing  as well as  hopefully  helping meat eaters realize that choosing compassion is the right choice   how our truth needs to be spoken is in a way that connects with those people's minds  at their stage of development  through the heart  in a way that's relatable  in my opinion    if anyone is interested in checking me out  i do have a website   www mettasutta net  https   www mettasutta net      although i'd like to mention that the website is not fully finished yet  it's under construction  alternatively check out my youtube channel  i recently deleted all my videos from other channels  and reuploaded the best i've made thus far on my main channel  metta sutta   some are english  some are norwegian     https   www youtube com channel ucakjcrmcwoy2fsjbf5uxctq  https   www youtube com channel ucakjcrmcwoy2fsjbf5uxctq    if there is anything particularly good or bad about my videos thus far  feedback is highly appreciated       i will be actively responding to whatever does  or doesn't  come out of this post  i'm a little bit giddy  and nervous  but at the same time inspired and grateful for doing this   i'm hoping that i can use the responses i get from everyone in

ethically to not reveal you are vegan to those around you when they keep questioning it  noticing that all your  excuses  seemingly align with vegan outcomes   in terms of health   i watched my father die of cancer  it broke me  every time i see the animal products he consumed a lot of    i think of the agony he went through in the last stages of his life    and i can t bring myself to bring that pain into my life again   so i immediately go for whole food plants to hopefully prevent it   a lot of my family heavily argues cancer is just in the family line  while i disagree with them  i m not a doctor so i don t know how educated i am on the topic  so i stay quiet   my father got cancer  his father got cancer  both died in their 50s long before they should have    both the kindness members of the family    sad face   everyone  in former associations i had with them  when we would regularly eat together    we don t do it anymore because of     reasons    see profile for irrelevant explanation of that     heavily argued non stop that my grandfathers death was genetic   thing is     they eat so much god dam meat  every meal   meat  red meat  fish  chicken  or some other former sentient animals flesh   so much bacon  ungodly amounts of bacon  so much so  that when my loving grandmother made me a bean soup  she s the only one who i told i was plant based  but she s not the brightest person and never understood it  so this wasn t intentional on her part  trust me   she put bacon in the sauce to flavor it  thinking it was fine since it was only a bit   dairy  cheese  so much god dam cheese  milk    when i was a young child i naturally consumed the same foods  up until about 15   looking back  my symptoms were insane and really bad  such that i m surprised i never considered the food i was eating could be causing me to have these issues   rashes  everywhere  for arms  shins  oh my god dam fingers  bottom of my feet  it was so bad  even when i didn t scratch it would get worse  and when i did scratch i d get blamed by my family for it getting to that point   it s only that bad because you scratch  if you stopped it would go away   nah it s not the food at all   i d wake up 3 days a week seeing blood everywhere on my bed from the scraps opening up    cravings  i d go through non stop physical shakes if i didn t  have dairy products 3 times a week  my loving father had to limit my ice cream consumption to 3 days a week because i was ballooning up  but i was always trying    my best   i swear    but the cravings kept getting more and more intense until i gave in   depression and fatigue  non stop fatigue  i d be told by family that i just wasn t eating enough  them proudly patting their ballooned stomach  i forced myself to eat more of the garbage food  i definitely ate more  but my fatigue got worse and i gained weight    all of this is to just show   how sick and tired i was of my health feeling like garbage  so i stoped  i told family my decision to just limit  l said lying  knowing i wasn t eating any behind closed doors  animal products  so please   if they cook  just give me the non animal based parts of the meal   i d be more than happy to bring my own food if the entire meal is animal based tho  they had to do nothing extra   first  they asked why  i explained that i was trying to see if changing my diet could help my symptoms  they told me i was being silly  it wasn t the food  and that i needed to keep eating these health calorie dense foods  it s in our dna   second  when the above strategy did not work  and it became clear that for about 2 months i had not gave up  skin improving before their eyes  but they ignored that  claiming i was just not scratching    i was still scratching a lot  they didn t believe me   they tried a new strategy  guilt tripping me   they told me i could 100   cheat  1 day a week and my health would be fine  when i told them  cheating requires me to want to eat those foods because it brings pleasure  and i don t get pleasure from the side effects i do still get after eating it  so i don t  cheat  with foods that cause pain    they god mad    oh  so your grandmother slaves over a stove and you are going to be disrespectful and not eat it  wow     no  i do eat the food she makes  see  i m right now eating plain pasta  l   it s rude to not eat everything  you are insinuating she s doing a bad job and making you sick  that s rude    what  no  i m just trying to figure out symptoms by isolating my diet to foods that work  and if i add something in it will show me if my reaction is negative      i disagree  it s rude       seeing no other way out  i lied  my doctor told me to do this  are you telling me i should ignore my doctor     this shut down all complaints  once i tied it into  my doctor told me to do this   they had a difficult time arguing back that i m being rude  although they did try  and the sane people at the table would go    dude  does op tell you to stop taking your anti acid pills your doctor recommended      that s not the same thing  this is food not medication     i specifically heard you tell me your doctor told you not to eat x food groups and you wouldn t need to take the anti acid pills  so unless you want us to judge you for ignoring doctors orders  leave op alone   go  grandma  love you  so much    even if you put bacon in my food without understanding why it was bad  but you stopped when i asked you not to  so we gucchi    so    i know that was a long rant  but  my point  when i lie about being vegan to the awful people in my family  or awful people in general    it solves so many problems and allows me to live my life  i don t want to be an activist right now given how bad and abusive my family was growing up  but  is lying unethical  and contributing to the problem even more  and i should be willing to take the hostility    when my family suspected i d become vegan  the anger was insane  they literally told me i was lying to do them for x  y  and z reasons  they went off on how i was judging them for their choices and i needed to stop bullying them and just eat the dam food  and until i finally lied  telling them it was my doctors advice     they kept getting worse   now  i am away from those family members now  but     i just dont think i can handle the hostility associated with activism  but i can not contribute to the problem  is this okay    \n",

_plantbased _changes _benefits _advantages   https   www reddit com r vegan comments j43mpf 6_month_plantbased_changes_benefits_advantages    i've linked my 6 month update above in case anyone wants to read it  i'm 35  british  male  and live in rome  italy  the friday after we locked down here for covid  friday 6th march  i idly wondered if i could manage to not eat dairy  meat or fish for a week   well  that felt good and manageable  so it became a month and now i'm a year in  thought i should share my experiences in case anybody wants to hear it  weight   i lost it  i'm about 6'2 and weighed around 81kg  i didn't regularly weigh myself before going vegan    summer last year i'd sometimes be as little as 73 kg  but i think that's cos sometimes in the summer you feel you don't need to eat much   i've settled at about 75kg and i'm still eating an awful lot while doing hardly any exercise  muscle definition is better  more pronounced  i nearly have abs  waist goes in more  though i think i'm still using the same hole on my belt  skin   far better  old marks  not scars  but just things that are about orange or purpley which have appeared without reason at some time or another on my skin  are fading or have faded completely  mosquito bites seem to heal more quickly too    skin on body is also somehow softer  smoother   tricky one to describe  skin on face   basically no breakouts now  fingers crossed    i was certainly still annoying getting spots now and then despite being well past my teenage years  but now my skin is clear  though wearing a mask all day a lot of the time cos of covid often dries out the skin just to the side of my nose  but then we'll have half term  i'm a teacher  and i wear masks way less and it's clear that's just down to the masks  last time  in the 6 month update i wrote about possibly being less wrinkly  dunno about that  face is definitely leaner though  cheekbones more pronounced  nose is less stuffy  blocked   used to be i would put those strips on my nose to keep the nostrils open while i slept  now i don't need them  think i'm sleeping better  think possibly  i'm recovering faster when i do go for a run  my main form of exercises   i haven't been running regularly recently  but when i have i feel like that soreness i'd sometimes get in my thighs   delayed onset muscle soreness is the name i think  is lesser than i might expect  it seems that plant based athletes recover more quickly and can train more as a result   i'm hardly an example of this but did think i should say  about a month ago i managed to run 12k on saturday morning and then 10 on the sunday    not sure i've done that much on successive days since jan 2018  i'd done a marathon in 2017 and wanted to better my time  but ended up injuring myself   my usual run   is 5 8 km   wasn't particularly sore afterwards after that weekend either  my nails are growing more quickly  i'm basically wolverine  people talk about having more energy   i don't know about that  i've always had loads of energy from first thing in the morning onwards  once was nicknamed the duracell bunny   possibly tmi stuff   so feel free to avoid  bo   dramatically reduced  to the degree that i don't bother with deodorant any more  before i used to use one of those deo blocks from lush   i don't work in construction or a really physical job or anything  but it does get hot obviously here in italy  and even after i go running or whatever my tee shirts and my armpits don't smell too bad  digestion   i've never had a problem with constipation  always attributing this to plenty of exercise and fruit  but shall we say  i have even less of a problem now  perhaps i used to make 1 or 2  sitting visits  to the bathroom every day  now it's more like 3 or 4   suppose i might be spending more on toilet paper   is this why being vegan is generally thought to be so expensive  for the first few days though  digestion was interesting  i didn't have diarrhoea or anything  but ready access to a toilet was useful  luckily i was working from home   it even came out green a few times  erections   feel like they're harder  perhaps last longer and perhaps that my  recovery time  is less  used to be  after i came that'd be it for that session and the little guy was having a rest for a few hours  but lately  i reckon round 2 might be on the cards  also  i did wonder  months back  whether i'd gotten slightly bigger when hard  than usual  not so that anyone else would notice  it's not like i gained inches  but it felt slightly different in my hand   could just be that that's because it's harder  or maybe i really did gain something  in girth   this doesn't really matter  it could all be in my head  i typed hand there accidentally lol  it's not about to affect my relationship  the difference  if there is one  is minimal  but wanted to put it out there  dunno if my cum tastes better  sorry    end of the tmi  think eating plant based has helped me with a long term injury  i got illiotibial band syndrome in jan 2018 and since then have alternately rested and down lots of stretching and exercises to strengthen and heal it  and sometimes run  while takign care to try to not to worsen it  it seems almost healed now  plant foods should have helped with inflammation in theory    trouble is i complicated it on one of my occasional runs  before going plant based  and managed to give myself hip bursitis  trochanteritis   though this is also getting better  and i also attribute it's getting better partly to time  the great healer  and partly to my diet    honestly  i don't see myself eating meat  fish or dairy again  i'm really happy with my diet  and as time goes on  and now i find the animals rights and environmental reasons equally compelling  my friends and family know i'm vegan  and i've been encouraging them to try it  colleagues at work know and gently take the piss  but they can see that i'm the healthiest person there i mean  i prob was before too  so for me that makes it more compelling   i didn't have too much spare weight on me as far as i was concerned  or any worrying health problems  but all these unexpected benefits happened  at the same time as safeguarding my future health  i'm able to advocate for animal rights and be more environmentally friendly   some resources i've found really helpful are mic the vegan on youtube  michael greger's how not to die book  and his website nutritionfacts  plant based news on youtube is good too  thanks for reading  and sorry for the long post  tl dr  i've been plant based for a year and it's great  i don't see myself going back   \n",

dude and vegan  reddit about a week ago and then just found this sub  being the upvote whore that i am  i thought i would copy paste it in case anyone here cared  p   this post ended up being really long and rambling  so im adding this at the start  tl dr i went from meat lover to vegan almost literally overnight because of alex's arguments for veganism  and the documentary  land of hope and glory  by earthling ed was what pushed me over the edge and finally made me abandon my cognitive dissonance and excuses i was making   i dont know if he reads anything on this sub  but if by any chance alex sees this  then thank you for all your work and opening my eyes to the immense amount of suffering and death that i have been supporting all my life up until this point   ive been watching for a while  mainly interested in the philosophical arguments after watching atheist experience for a number of years  and honestly  when he first started doing veganism related content  i wasnt very interested and only flicked through a couple of videos not really paying attention  but something stuck in my mind and eventually i came back to watch a bunch of it fully  and i came to the realization that there is simply no valid argument  at least for someone in my position  for consuming animal products in the way i did  i resisted at first  mainly using a pretty lazy and nihilistic justification of  well  im such a small cog in the machine  what im doing makes no real difference    but i felt a pang of guilt every time i ate meat  this lasted  i think  several months   then roughly a week or so ago  i sat down  with a pork sausage sandwich  and started browsing youtube videos  and i come across podcast  9 with earthling ed   https   youtu be r btn8ajs04  https   youtu be r btn8ajs04    i watch for a little while and am hit with the same guilt ive been feeling more and more often as  what i now recognize to be     my cognitive dissonance starts to break down  partway through the video earthling ed's documentary  land of hope and glory  was mentioned  i had never heard of him or any of his work before watching the interview   link to the documentary  gt   https   www landofhopeandglory org   https   www landofhopeandglory org    and i was curious  so i paused that video and googled it  and started watching  the pork sausage sandwich is about half eaten at this point   as much as i kind of hate overly dramatic language like this  i dont think its an exaggeration to say that video changed my life  i had heard before about the process of slaughtering animals  about how they were stunned with a boltgun and then had their throats cut  or how pigs were put into gas chambers  but i had never actually been confronted with it  never been forced to witness an actual intelligent living animal screaming in pain and terror and clawing at the cage around it as it suffocated to death  or witnessing a cow fail to be stunned in a setting right out of a cheesy torture porn horror movie and have its throat slashed while still conscious and its horrific writhing as it bleeds to death  and as silly as it sounds  i remember looking at that sausage sandwich on my desk and something finally clicked in my head and i no longer saw it as just a tasty lunch  but as a lump of dead meat from a tortured animal  and i simply could not finish that sandwich  i even tried to reason with myself that it was just a waste of food to throw it away at this point  but i just couldn't stomach it   and from there  the floodgates had opened  i realized that if i couldn't eat meat anymore  then milk and cheese were off the table too  since those industries were just as bad for all the same reasons  fish i found were more difficult to empathize with  and i almost flirted with the idea of going vegan except still consuming fish  until i mentally slapped myself with how silly that idea was   can fish really feel pain  i swear i read they couldnt     a quick google informed me that  yes  fish have nervous systems and therefore feel pain  duhhhhh  and of course i realized that ive always found the japanese whaling industry incredibly problematic  so why am i applying those standards to large sealife but not smaller ones   ive not been vegan long now  as i said  about a week  but honestly  what has surprised me most is this   its so easy  i had this idea in my head before that i would have to be some sort of ridiculous  taste martyr  to be vegan and exist off of salad and nuts for the rest of my life    and then i had my first vegan sausage and realised  if i didnt know better  i would have thought it was meat  alternative cheese  butter  milk  chicken  sausages etc    it all tastes really good   what the hell   why isnt this better known   as for health  my diet has been quickly improving  im still consuming wayyyyy too much sugar  im far too addicted to fizzy drinks  but im eating far more leafy greens  veg and fruit  and im really enjoying it   the only problem im having now is trying not to be the  preachy vegan  to my family  i dont know whats right at this point  to live and let live  or to really try and push what ive learned on those close to me  i almost feel obligated to try and spread the message at this point as penance for all the suffering ive caused   this was wayyyy longer than i meant to make it and if you made it this far  thankyou for listening to my rambling    \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        the very fact that one is alive means consuming nutrients     and staying alive means that something  somewhere  must die in order to supply these nutrients  this is a fact of life     and the marvellous thing about a fact is that one can not argue with it  one can argue about a belief  an opinion  a theory  an ideal and so on     but a fact  never  one can deny a fact   pretend that it is not there   but once seen  a fact brings freedom from choice and decision  most people think and feel that choice implies freedom   having the freedom to choose   but this is not the case  freedom lies in seeing the obvious  and in seeing the obvious there is no choice  no deliberation  no agonising over the  right  and  wrong  judgment  in the freedom of seeing the fact there is only action   when it comes to the consumption of nutrients there are many and various beliefs one can hold dearly to  there are people who will not eat red meat at all     only white meat and fish  then there are people who will not eat any flesh of warm blooded animals at all     only fish and reptiles  then there are people    vegetarians    who will not eat any meat at all  but will consume eggs and dairy products  then there are people    vegans    who will eat only vegetables  grain and seed  then there are people    fruitarians    who will only eat fruit  then   as we go into myth and fantasy   there are those who live on water and air     and finally those who live on air only   some vegetarians maintain that as a carrot  for example  does not scream audibly when it is pulled from the ground there is no distress caused by the consumption of vegetables  yet the carrot indubitably dies slowly by being extracted from its life support system   the ground is its home   and is this not distressing on some level of a living  growing organism  it all depends upon the level  or degree  of  aliveness  that one ascribes to things  vegans  for instance  will not consume eggs as this prevents an incipient life from being born  fruitarians go one step further and say that  as the consumption of carrots prevents them from going to seed and sprouting new life  vegetables are to be eschewed entirely  then  as the eating of grain and seeds also prevent potential life forms from growing  they will eat only the flesh of the fruit that surrounds the kernel and plant out the embryo plant form  i have been a fruitarian so i know full well what i am speaking of    the obvious fact is clearly demonstrated by taking all this to its ultimate consideration  what will one do   as a fruitarian causing no pain or the taking of life of anyone or anything   about those pesky things like mosquitoes  sand flies  cockroaches  rats  mice and other  vermin  that invade my house  put up screens  what about outside  will i slap them dead     or just shoo them away  what will one do if attacked by a snake  a crocodile  a shark  a lion and so on  do as the revered scriptures say and turn the other cheek  will i humbly submit to my fate and be mauled severely myself   or even killed   simply because of a religious injunction  a moral scruple  a noble ideal  a virtuous belief  a passionate opinion  a deeply held ethical theory  in other words  have animals and insects been given the right  by some inscrutable god  to do with me whatsoever they wish  is my survival dependent upon the non existent benevolence of all those sentient beings that i am not going to cause distress to   what then about germs  bacteria  bacillus  microbes  pathogens  phages  viruses and so on  are they not entitled to remain alive and pain free  if one takes medication for disease  one is   possibly painfully   killing off the microscopic creatures that one s body is the host too  some religions   the jain religion in india  for example   has its devout members wearing gauze over their nose and mouths to prevent insects from flying in and they even carry small brooms to sweep the path as they walk so that they will not accidentally step on some creature  it can really get out of hand  for instance  small pox has been eradicated from the world by scientists as a means of saving countless human lives     is this somehow  wrong   what is  right  in regards to what i do in order to stay alive  if i do none of these things then i will be causing pain and suffering to myself     and i am a sentient being too  it is an impossible scenario  when pursued to its ultimate conclusion   and then there is the matter of one s fellow human beings  some of them   in fact at times a lot of them   are desirous of invading the country that one is living peacefully in  with the avowed intent of killing  torturing  raping  pillaging and subjugating oneself and one s fellow citizens  if one holds a strong and passionate belief in not causing any pain and suffering to other sentient beings then one must be more than a fruitarian     one must be a pacifist as well  this amounts to hanging out a sign   if everybody else in the country one lives in adopts this specific belief   which says  in effect   please feel free to invade us  we will not fight back  for we hold firmly to the principle of not causing pain and suffering to any sentient being whatsoever   the tibetan situation is a particular case in point   thus anarchy would rule the world     all because of a belief system handed down by the saints and the sages  the messiahs and the avatars  the redeemers and the saviours  the prophets and the priests  century after century    \n",

    "We can observed that from the distribution plot, Keto have much more coverage in terms of area under graph as compared to Vegan. Also from the summary table, we could see that Vegan has 1002 entries while Keto has 1045 entries. Both have fairly similar count of entries. However if we look closer into the combined histogram, we can see that vegan have quite a number of posts standing out with word count of 50 and below. The boxplot tells us about the distribution from another angle, here we can see that there are alot of outliers from approximately 400 to 500 word counts. We can observe that Keto have 3 extreme outliers with approximately 1900 words above. Stop words may have contributed to the count for the outliers. Outliers could be posts that are guides written on the inividual topic therefore I have chosen not to remove them."

They say how milk is made to drink and how we need it and how I need to drink milk because almond milk is expensif! (while its cheaper than normal milk) Then there saying that my vegtables I buy to make my own food are to expensive while my sister bought €15 on delevir food and my parents €40 on tuna salad and fish dish.\\n\\nIm really sad that they cant suport me because its also hard for me, I was kinda adicted to choclate and other sweeties but all of these has milk or gelatine so I had to stop.

It's damn near impossible to find a vegan bass strap with good grip and padding!\\n\\nDoes anyone have any recommendations as to brands or websites to look at that sell vegan guitar/bass straps? Getting desperate here - this thing is killing my shoulders.\\n\\nThanks in advance!   \n",

I love my food and feel like I’m eating well. I’ve been eating chia seed pudding, overnight oats, or drinking vegan protein shakes with berries for breakfast, tofu, what I think are lots of veg, beans, and/or nuts for lunch, dinner, or snacks, but I’m not feeling well today nor was I yesterday. I’ve just been inexplicably tired and really grumpy. Is this some fluke or do I need to make adjustments for my coming week? Is this common in the beginning? Is it stupid of me to make that connection? I just want to make sure I’m doing it right.   \n",

I don't remember a ton from it though, and I'd like to read it over again if anyone has a link. I don't know how most people on here feel about them, but it's a bit confusing to me; there's so much claims of bad/useless things they've done, but I'm suspicious how much of it is fabricated/exaggerated to make animal rights advocacy look ridiculous.   \n",

It's not even true that animals aren't rational, or that they have no concept of morality. When an elephant tries to rescue a baby rhino trapped in mud, that elephant clearly has a concept of morality. When a pigeon recognises CAT scans of people who have cancer, CAT scans that even human experts find difficult to discern, then clearly they have a form of rationality that surpasses even human beings. So even if the argument wasn't an embrassingly obvious contradiction (it is), the argument would STILL fail. And yet it's the most common pro-cruelty argument I've seen. Absurd.   \n",

       "1004  Alex O'Connor in his (sarcastic) [Why I eat dog meat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuP_HaVbAx4) mentions that euthanised pets commonly end up being fed to livestock. Although the fact does not surprise me, I'm struggling to find evidence for it.\\n\\nThe video itself points to two sources regarding this, [ASPCA Pet Euthanasia Stats](https://www.aspca.org/animal-homelessness/shelter-intake-and-surrender/pet-statistics#:~:text=We%20estimate%20that%20the%20number,670%2C000%20dogs%20and%20860%2C000%20cats) and Safran Foer's *Eating Animals* p. 27. \\n\\nThis is the relevant part I've found in the latter:\\n\\n&gt;Rendering — the conversion of animal protein unfit for human consumption into food for livestock and pets\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAlthough I have evidence that euthanized pets are processed in rendering plants, I can't find what particular products produced from the plants originate from the euthanised pets.\\n\\nFor example, [from the library of congress](http://www.nationalaglawcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/assets/crs/RS21771.pdf) (bold is mine):\\n\\n&gt;Renderers annually convert 47 billion pounds or more of raw animal materials intoapproximately 18 billion pounds of products.  Sources for these materials include meatslaughtering and processing plants (the primary one); dead animals from farms, ranches,feedlots, marketing barns, **animal shelters**, and other facilities; and fats, grease, and otherfood waste from restaurants and stores.\\n\\nAnd the Table 1 (last page) of the same document demonstrates a variety of uses for the end product of the rendering plants (including animal feed).\\n\\nHowever, I can't find sources that would say what exactly is rendered from euthanised pets.   \n",

Just moved in to a new place and need to buy a mattress. I've looked at many vegan beds online but they're all in the $900's to $1000's range. I'm on a budget and just need a decent bed, nothing fancy, and animal cruelty free. Does anybody know of a mattress brand that it's vegan, price ranging a little over and under $500?   \n",

This would make some words from PorterStemmer tough to infer, and which I would choose to Lemmertize instead."

       "1002  third time doing keto a a type 2 diabetic i'm worried that it's too late i wa first diagnosed with type 2 diabetes about 4 year ago at the time i wa really afraid so i began researching the internet for the best diet to treat this disease which is when i first learned about keto i wa so impressed with the science behind it that i decided to give it a try and it worked it only took a day or two before i saw my glucose number drop to a normal range the combination of lchf along with intermittent fasting and regular exercise worked like a charm until i entered a long term depressive episode unrelated to keto and i stopped for about a year the second time on keto wa even better i managed to bring my a1c down from 12 to 5 6 then you guessed it i fell into another year long depression and stopped again i began a year long food indulgence spree and ate whatever i wanted whenever i wanted and now i fear the damage is too great to reverse last week i started to feel extremely weak it wa so concerning that i decided to check my blood sugar for the first time in over a year the number i saw on the glucometer shocked me 423 i knew it would be high but not that high it wa something i could no longer willfully ignore and decided immediately to stop this vicious cycle i wa putting myself through and return to keto at first everything seemed to be going in the right direction my blood sugar wa still high but in the 200s now instead of the 400s i began omad if my usual and moderate exercise basically the same routine i had done twice before that seemed to work well for me but after a full week of returning to a healthier lifestyle i'm starting to feel defeated i feel like the damage i've done to my body is too much and now it can't be fixed i just cannot get my blood sugar below 200 anymore before it wa so easy to do yesterday morning my glucose wa at 234 and after drinking coffee with a tablespoon of heavy cream it shot up to 320 this didn't make any sense to me how can zero carbs cause such a dramatic insulin spike this post is already way longer than i intended it to be so i'll just end it here i didn't really know where else to turn i feel like giving up because i feel like it's too late for me but at the same time i know keto is the best thing for me and i'm too scared to go to the doctor because i don't want to start taking insulin i wanted to fix this on my own but i no longer believe that i can   \n",

    "Our main goals/concerns are to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. High accuracy of classification\n",
    "2. Increase the True Negative count.\n",
    "3. Reduce False Negative (Type II Error).\n",
    "4. Increase Specificity score.\n",
    "5. Increase Sensitivity score.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason is because type II Error would mean that a post from the subreddit 'Keto' is being classified as 'Vegan'.\n",
    "Ethical vegans strongly believe that all creatures have the right to life and freedom. Therefore, they oppose ending a conscious being's life simply to consume its flesh, drink its milk, or wear its skin — especially because alternatives are available. Whereas Keto diet consist of about 75% fat, 10-30% protein and no more than 5% or 20 to 50 grams of carbs per day. Focus on high-fat, low-carb foods like **eggs, meats, dairy** and low-carb vegetables, as well as sugar-free beverages. Therefore, it would be disastrous to classify a Keto post as Vegan. \n",
    "\n",
    "The score of this model is:\n",
    "- Accuracy: 0.9598\n",
    "- True Negative: 237\n",
    "- False Negative: 9\n",
    "- Specificity: 0.9556\n",
    "- Sensivitity: 0.964\n",
    "\n",
    "The training and test accuracy scores for this model are 96.92%, 95.98% respectively indicating that the model is well fitted as the scores are fairly similar, the false negative count indicates that 9 keto posts are wrongly classified as vegan and true negative count indicates the number of vegan post predicted correctly. Specificity score is at 95.56% indicating the accuracy of predicted vegan posts that were correctly identified. Sensitivity score is at 96.4%, representing the number of Keto posts being indentified correctly."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To revisit what our main goals/concerns are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- High accuracy of classification\n",
    "- Increase the True Negative count.\n",
    "- Reduce False Negative (Type II Error).\n",
    "- Increase Specificity score.\n",
    "- Increase Sensitivity score.\n",
    "\n",
    "My model of choice would be the Second last model, Random Forest paired with Countvectorizer. Reason being is that \n",
    "even though the last model (Random forest with TF-IDF Vectorizer) had achieve slightly better scores on some aspects, The chosen model had better scores on *True Positive count* ,*False Negative count* and *sensitivity score*.\n",
    "\n",
    " - A higher *True Positive count* would dictate that more Keto posts are predicted correctly. \n",
    " - A lower *False Negative count* would dictate that lesser predicted Keto post to be Vegan.\n",
    " - A higher *Sensitivity score* would dictate accuracy of Keto posts that were correctly identified. \n",
    "\n",
    "To refresh our memory:\n",
    "\n",
    "These scores are crucial as ethical vegans have strong beliefs that all creatures have the right to life and freedom. Therefore, they oppose ending a conscious being's life simply to consume its flesh, drink its milk, or wear its skin — especially because alternatives are available. And people who are into Keto do not have any concern where they get their nutrition from, be it plants or animals as long as their nutrition requirement has been fulfilled. Therefore we take the mentioned scores into serious consideration to mitigate the risk of Keto posts being classified as Vegan for our client.   \n",
    "\n",
    "However, as there are still room for improvement in the model that we have explored. We can further improve our model with more data (posts being scrapped) or even increase the time horizon of the data scrapped to probably 2-3 years post's age. This is because forums usually have lingos so we might be able to capture such lingos used in different subreddit to help increase the accuracy. We can also explore using boosting in models such as XGBoost to see if they yield better results."
